"I watched it in Blu-ray 3D with some friends, and surprisingly the 3D effects DO hold up well! We found ourselves amazed with their quality, taking into account the year this movie was released! 

The screenplay itself is very lacking; it has a very weird structure in wich the opening scene is the best part by far and feels as it should've been the climax of the film, and after that you never know who should be the POV character for the audience. Even when she is presented, we are already halfway through the movie and you don't know if you should get invested in her or if the writers are just going to kill her off unceremoniously like the previous ""main"" characters. I guess this kind of structure does work some years later with Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", but in that film they keep you guessing in a far better way; I guess that's because the mistery is more of an actual mistery, in contrast to ""House of Wax"", in wich is super obvious who the killer is from the get go!

It should have been a revenge story; I feel the main antagonist should have been the man who sets up the fire in the beggining, but he is killed too quickly and we are stuck with some high-society folks who we don't care about.

But as I said, the 3D and the practical effects work marvelously.",1,0,2018-10-29T18:52:39.000Z,FJ García,UCdlF42KB9LHX08ZYDLbLBHg,-xE19yV2B2Q,True,UgyY_E8a9UsT5hQwsS94AaABAg

"Adventure games declined for the same reason fighting games did: originally they were the games you played that had the best graphics. As tech improved you could do graphics on par with an adventure game in an action game. Same thing happened with fighting games since only having 2 characters on screen in the early polygon days meant you could spend more polygons on each character. Eventually graphics caught up there too. 

Folks ask ""why don't people buy adventure games"" but the real question is ""Why did they in the first place"". And the answer is that it was an experience you couldn't get elsewhere.

"I honestly related a LOT to Mae- not the low self esteem or the violent/criminal behavior. But when she does talk about why she beat up that kid, why she dropped out... well, it’s something I’ve never really seen or heard or read anyone else experiencing. I actually cried really hard at that point because it was way too real to me. 
I have pretty extreme anxiety and have had some really bad bouts of depression. I make my escape in games and books. But there were points, mostly when I was younger (I’m 20) when I’d suddenly get hit with this terrible wave, where it became too clear to me that these people and these situations are fake. It’s not real. It was all pointless. And suddenly my escapes became just as dreadful as everything else. 
And I looked around and the world was pointless. Just as fake as my books. And none of it mattered. Like Mae says, everything was just...shapes. 
   It’s a terrifying feeling. Suddenly there’s nothing to hold on to, nothing to ground you. I didn’t become violent, like Mae does. I just broke down.

"As an old person who was in her early 20's when this movie came out, I just want to clear a couple of things. Theater gimmicks were not a thing in the 80's. That was one of the things that made this movie unique, the different endings was almost an homage to an art form outside the movie experience; Madeline Kahn was well known for not only Blazing Saddles, but also Young Frankenstein; Martin Mull was very well known as a comedic genius having been associated with The Smother Brothers,  Johnathan Winters, and more importantly, the TV Show ""Mary Hartman Mary Hartman"" and how easy it is to forget his truly masterpiece song, ""White Man Blues"", that came out the year before;  While Christopher Lloyd may have only been known as Reverend Jim from, ""Taxi"", he did win 2 Emmy's for that role while turning it from a walk-on to a regular character;  and while Michael McKean did have familiarity from his role on, ""Laverne & Shirley"", he was equally well-known for his role in counter-culture influence. in ""This Is Spinal Tap"".  In my opinion, this is why the movie is a cult classic: because it had non-mainstream comedians who were well known for taking gentle but firm pokes at mainstream. And then to top it off, you have Tim Curry, Dr. Frankenfurter, as the centerpiece and ending the film with Howard Hesseman, who was most famous as Dr. Johnny Fever from ""WKRP in Cincinatti"".  The reason art becomes cult classics is because it is too forward thinking for mainstream. ""Clue"" didn't take itself seriously. It was made for shear fun. Fortunately, a group of fans who ""get it"" keep it alive and eventually, mainstream catches up. Cult Classics are the wheels that keep us moving forward.",1,1,2018-10-24T20:36:24.000Z,rmhuff,UCVyXYbO4lFPhDfhvZoE_5uw,qBjYfSh7tZw,True,UgwweD97u46OBWCvGTB4AaABAg

"When it was released, you didn't 'get' it unless you actually PLAYED the game. It was hilarious - IF you had played the game, which I had played since the 1960's. It was NEVER meant to be a serious movie. It was very tongue-in-cheek. All the criticism about it not being scary or suspenseful was baloney. When it was originally released, the ending was different depending on where you saw it. That made it fun. Then the ending was changed to show ALL the endings. I found the cast to be excellent.

"You forgot one of the biggest reasons Clue failed:

It CRAVES multiple viewings. I think the directors/promoters realized that, and why they did the gimmick. I watch Clue 3 or 4 times a year, and I still find something (a clue, a witty joke, or something else) that I hadn't ever noticed. 

It is funnier every time you watch it - and it gets less confusing. The dialogue is rapid fire, so it is easy to miss some of the hilarious lines.

"Just watched this again tonight (inspired by watching this very video a few days ago). Coming up on the Worthless song number, I could not figure out which vehicle you were referring to as an implied suicide. After watching it, I can only presume it's the small green pickup atop the school bus singing about working on a reservation (edit☆ rewatching your video I see you specifically pointed it out). This truck speeds off the bus as the magnet approaches from behind, and in the next cut the truck  is on the conveyor. 
However, I don't agree with the interpretation that it was basically suicid. I always interpreted the truck speeding off as him fleeing the magnet, and in the next shot we see he couldn't escape and is now resigned to his fate. If you watch the shots coming up to and after him speeding away, he speeds forward off the bus, the same direction the conveyor is moving, but in the next shot is facing backwards as if he had been picked up by the magnet and was unceremoniously dropped.

"I suspect (wink, wink) the movie was originally poorly received for all the reasons you name, plus the fact that much of the material was unworthy of a brilliant and under-utilized cast. 

When we see the conclusion of even a comic mystery, we want to think the solution was the only possible one. I like your take on the “false” endings. Clue might have benefited from today’s more interactive media environment in which it could be financially viable to show all three endings, and let audiences compare notes.

I guess every generation since Edison has movies  that we watch and rewatch as kids, and fall in love with before we realize the adult world has mixed opinions about our favorite “masterpieces”. I’m of the first generation that still can’t quite absorb that people like Roald Dahl and a number of critics and (to a very small extent) me can find any fault with a movie as awesome as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. We’re the folks who see Martín Mull and think first of his Garth/Barth Gimble characters on Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman and Fernwood Tonight.",0,0,2018-10-23T23:50:02.000Z,Vince Gay,UCbDEOI0iZRfygeXI7DrsTkQ,qBjYfSh7tZw,True,UgwrQGeYQBnI9PORYq14AaABAg

"I saw this in three different theaters on different nights when it came out. They did advertise which ending you saw in each theater (as A B or C) so you could go to find the correct ending you wanted.

This is a classical farcical comedy and anyone who thought it was something different would have been severely disappointed. It was brilliant slapstick  with homages to the repartee from older screwball comedies done by great artists in their field.  

Should it be redone, I can't see Reynolds as Wadsworth. He would be better suited to Mustard or Green.  Though truly, I don't know many comedians today (younger ones) who have the sensibilities to pull off this type of language/physical comedy.

"I was born in 1973.  My Mom was a huge mystery fan, and I got infected by that particular bug.  Specifically, she was an Agatha Christie fan, and Christie admitted that her writing style was to write the social interactions, then figure out who the LEAST likely murderer was and tag them as the killer, and plant evidence in the narrative to support that conclusion, so multiple endings are not /just/ a gimmick, it's actually a bow to Mrs. Christie.  Mom had originally wanted to watch Clue in the theater, but after early reviews, and the gimmicks involved, decided to wait until it ended up on TV or VHS before watching.  To my recollection, it took a couple of years to end up on VHS, as I'm extremely certain I remember we didn't see it on VHS until at least 1986.  It was the first thing I remember seeing Tim Curry in, and Back to the Future had been out for a while, so Christopher Lloyd was known in my household, both for that film, as well as Taxi, which by then was in solid syndication, along with other syndication vehicles that showed or showcased the rest of the cast of Clue.

(we caught it during the reenactment part of the movie (not the beginning of it either) Then it aired at the same time on the same channel for three more Halloweens and we got to watch it from the beginning.

As far as I'm concerned about the ending of the movie, it could be any of them. (although yes, I mostly remember them from the all three endings together format) Each one had things that lead it to be the culprit but also continuity errors that made you question the answer. I still enjoy them though. :)

"Interesting.  This film was released when I was in college, and I was stoked!  Several of my friends and I went to see it, and, as much as I so wanted to love it--I didn't.  I agree with a lot you have to say about it, Warren (and Kahn) look fabulous, and the set is perfect for the mystery genre, but the humor just falls flat for me.  I am a dry wit kind of guy, though I can enjoy other types of humor.  I never was a fan of slapstick, which is where I think most of the humor falls.  There were some clever and amusing lines, though.  Enter Mrs. White, ""looking pale and tragic."" ""I like my men like Kleenex...soft, strong, and disposable,"" is my all time favorite.  I was really surprised to learn of it's cult status and the popularity of people quoting lines on social media.  The extent of my social media exposure is pretty much limited to Facebook, so I guess my not knowing about the quotations is no real surprise.

Tim Curry wasn't my first celeb crush, though I thought him pretty sexy as a transvestite--and that's saying something! Lesley Ann Warren was my first female crush as well! She was in a tv movie ""Portrait of a Stripper"" and a mini-series called ""Seventh Avenue"" about a woman who goes from streetwalker to high-priced call girl who is--of course--saved from the life (if I remember rightly) by love. Love the whole cast and can't see anyone else playing the roles.

"I picked this game up years ago when I saw it in a closeout store for $5. I've never actually played it though. It may sound trivial, but it was the fact that it was entirely keyboard controlled that turned me off. I intended to play it at some point, but just never got around to it.

I loved the first two games, but to be honest, the third game, Curse, was my least favorite. I really didn't like the large cartoon styled graphics. The fact that they were larger lead to most locations feeling smaller and more claustrophobic with less things to interact with. I also thought the puzzles were harder than the first two games. There were some areas that I had to consult a walkthrough for because I had no idea how to get past them. It does contain one of my favorite bits from the series though.

"I absolutely LOVE this movie. It is my absolute favorite! My family and I have memorized the entire script and sometimes we will just start off on one sentence and see how far we can get, or act along with the characters when we watch the film. 
My mom was a teenager when this film came out and she remembers it in theaters. She remembers how if you wanted to see the alternate endings you had to go to different theaters. She and her sister, and a bunch of their friends, would get together each weekend to go to another theatre to watch the alternate ending somewhere else. They found that gimmick fun, but admitted that having to pay each time was a bit aggravating. 
We also really love the game clue in our family though, so perhaps it's not so odd that we loved the film.

"Strangely, for the most part I never really found dark themes in G/PG animated movies like this to be “scary” or “disturbing” as I did just fascinating. Even when I was a kid it seems like it drew me in in some way, though I was still too dumb to understand why (feels kind of ironic now that then I used to hate myself for being scared of actual horror content. I believed I was the hugest wuss ever and never knew there were others more easily scared than I was.)
As I got older I feel the dark, serious tones only made me like and appreciate the movie even more. Not to mention it’s got some pretty great jams, too.

"Clue, from the beginning, doesn't take itself seriously.  It laughs at itself and invites us to poke fun at it too.
My concern is that a remake will pack it with so much bathroom humor (the dog poop on shoe is tired enough), off-color language and the cutesy, stupid humor common to movies like Bad Santa or most of the Adam Sadler and Will Ferrell movies that you won't be able to watch it with the whole family.

"When I first saw this movie I thought it was lame, hard to follow, and overall rather disappointing. The least important scenes went on for too long without a sense of any real deliberate plotting. Meanwhile, the most important scenes whizzed by so fast you didn't have time to digest what was happening or to let the punch lines sink in. And as the review points out, Clue is neither a mystery nor a comedy nor a parody but an unexpected combo of all three genres, which further added to the confusion. Even today I still think the movie has all of these problems, and so I don't think a remake will possibly sell unless somehow the script is given a complete overhaul. But doing so would be like cleaning a rather odd-looking but still unique old coin with a brillo pad and thereby ruining its original patina and texture. The thing is, when you watch Clue now in its extended form with all three endings giving it more coherence, with DVD or DVR remote in hand to control the pacing to your personal preferences, and with advance knowledge of the kind of quirkiness you are getting yourself into, the movie is nowhere near as flat as critics claimed and is in fact surprisingly enjoyable. Each time I have seen it since, I have picked up on still more of the subtleties that I previously missed. Even certain jokes that originally didn't work somehow manage to come to life when given a fair chance to reveal themselves, especially for anyone with a sense of history. There were a lot of good actors in this movie whose contributions were originally overshadowed by the way the movie was constructed, but like a coin being examined carefully under magnification, those finer elements really pop when they are given a chance to show through without the viewer having to worry about trying to keep up with the overall picture. Clue definitely has its problems, but to me it is still at least mildly lovable nonetheless.",0,0,2018-10-20T17:45:06.000Z,Mark L,UCdawzBFE6u7QxZo7NvrnLgw,qBjYfSh7tZw,True,Ugx7Wy_1s_HUplxcCCJ4AaABAg

"Might & Magic 2.  Not even a puzzle / adventure game, but featuring the worst puzzle I ever encountered.  You have to retrieve a critical plot artifact from a dungeon.  If you're carrying the artifact, it prevents you from leaving the dungeon.  There are multiple forms of teleportation spells / etc that should work, but they're all disabled for that one specific dungeon.  The ""solution"" is to hire a temporary party member in town, take them into the dungeon with you, give them the artifact, dismiss them from your party, walk out of the dungeon, go back to down, re-hire the temporary party member, and they'll still have the artifact in their inventory.

"I recently rewatched this movie with several friends and I'm pretty sure the only one who didn't enjoy it was also the only one who hadn't seen it before,  but he also has the strangest sense of humor among my friends, so hard to say whether or not seeing it younger would have changed his mind about it.  I would also like to say that while I generally don't care for modern remakes of older films, at the same time many of my favorite films (particularly in the horror genre) are themselves remakes from the 80's of films from the 50's or 60's, so I am actually all for more remakes.  After all, the story might appeal to a wider audience if not for the dated aesthetics, sensibilities, and even casts.  But I also think we should be remaking more ""bad"" movies so that maybe a newer, better version could be made.  I get that it's financially riskier, but do we really want to see the best movies remade over and over again when there are perfectly good stories that were poorly made once and now that's the only version we get?",0,0,2018-10-19T15:55:34.000Z,kinnikufan,UC5YGORBnanUWMOH986_ObZQ,qBjYfSh7tZw,True,Ugxem1ckXwrozQDaP8l4AaABAg

"For the record, I didn't get to see Clue in the theatre, but we did rent it when it first came out and I loved it. The VHS had all three endings, so that's how I first saw it. And I agree that it's the best way to see it. I own the DVD and it has several ways to watch it:
A) the home video cut with the three endings in a row.
B) you can pick which single ending to watch of the three.
C) you can select a random ending, where it will pick an ending for you, you just won't know which one until you get to the end.
The dog pooh joke and some lines falling flat are criticisms many people have, but there aren't too many movies out there where every line hit and every running gag is funny. Not to mention elements not aging well, which is true of sooo many films (and comedies specifically).

"Nowadays the film is look upon mostly in a positive way and has since become a cult classic, although I do agree the original idea of randomly only showing one of the 3 endings during it's theatrical run was a bad idea and I'm glad they came to their senses to include all 3 endings. Now as for this remake, well I do have to say that the films that should be remade are the films that didn't do well the first time rather than timeless classics but since the 1985 film wasn't a success at the box office despite being a fan favourite now so in my book it rightfully qualifies for a remake. It would probably include the new character Dr. Orchid if they are keeping it up to date. Now whether the film will be any good or not, it's hard to say right now but it's very likely that it will do better at the box office than the 1985 film but it'll probably suck like most comedy films these days which is quite ironic to be the exact opposite to the 1985 film but I hope I'm wrong.

"Two things, Roses mentioned sbcgfap(or strong bad's cool game for attractive pepole.) This is more along the lines of the tell tale sam and max games with loads of inside references and quite a few puzzles themed about them. The reason i think roses mentioned it in that context was because unlike sam and max, sbcgfap kind of required you to know about the characters or be a fan(especially in the teen girl squad segments and a few other places in quite a few episodes). I have seen this game being played in a stream and a good chunk of them seemingly hated it. 

Second thing, Trogdor is now a board game apparently. The brother chap had a kick starter for it and i think its getting released in 2019, comes with a mingame and features every variation of trogdor.

"Actually have this on DVD and didn't realise when first watched it that the original theatre release would show different endings at different theatres so glad they released it with the now classic 3 endings.
The only issue I have with a remake is the humour. Are we going to get Ryan Reynolds, if he does it, swearing left right and centre all way through the film therefore making it an R rated film.
Part of the humour to me is the child like innocence of the humour where the majority of it comes from words, it is very clever on this and you gave a few examples.
So would it be a totally new script or a proper remake of the original script? Will it still be a period piece or brought up to modern times? Is it still going to be a comedy or a serious crime drama? Which other cast members would be suitable for in the end the right ensemble has to be there for it to work?

"Ever notice how the Delta Rune looks kind of a lot like a cross between the Triforce and the Aerosmith logo? Can't help wondering if Toby might be a Freemason. That would explain the pillars shown in the opening cutscene. I should probably mention (or maybe I shouldn't) that I'm the grandson of a 32nd-degree Freemason.

1:51 * *cue 'One-Winged Angel'* * (Those pipe cleaner arms, though! Hit the gym, Azzy!)

2:34 And they call Sans a nihilist. Sans might be in the grip of fatalistic demotivation (we've all been there, haven't we?), but he's no nihilist. Also notice how Azzy's final form (the embodiment of edgy Anakin Angst to the max) resembles the Delta Rune, even with the triangle/pyramids under the circle and wings. The upper portion is totally the Aerosmith logo. I'm no occultist, but I know enough about history and culture to know that a circle typically represents ""order."" Wings typically represent something akin to ""triumph."" Therefore, it could be said that Asriel represents ""the triumph of order."" However, that doesn't mean that ""order"" is something that we actually want - not if it takes the form of Lawful Evil (which is what sorcery is all about).

3:36 Notice how Tobes is inverting, possibly even chastising, the LaVeyan left-hand path philosophy (also embodied by Knives Millions and Emperor Palpatine). This is in keeping with the theme of irony and juxtaposition running throughout this story. 'The Matrix' does the same thing. It's odd that Tobes would use such blatant occult symbolism to promote a philosophy that essentially inverts the left-hand path. But then, right-hand path philosophies are part of the same underlying machination. Notice how Sans, the Derse dreamer/enforcer of *""cosmic law,""* uses left-handed attacks to enforce a right-hand path philosophy. He also ""soul-gazes"" using his left eye (in keeping with his Derse alignment, if the symbolism is consistent). The Eye of Horus has a different meaning depending on whether it's the left (Thoth, Yin, Derse, moon) or right (Ra, Yang, Prospit, sun). Interesting to note is that, in Egyptian mythology, Horus lost his left eye just like Undyne. Also, Odin willingly sacrificed his right eye to gain *""cosmic wisdom.""*

*Note:* The word ""Necronomicon"" is typically assumed to mean ""book of the dead,"" but it can also mean ""law of the dead."" My emphasis on the words ""law"" and ""wisdom"" was not arbitrary.

7:56 Free will (chaos) versus determinism (order). Again, also explored in 'The Matrix'. I always take the side of free will.

8:24 Saving the best for last.

8:29 Why do you suppose Toby did that? What does it mean?

8:32 Technically, it should say ""geek out."" * *insert esoteric ""Psychobilly Geek-out"" reference that only Gen-Xers and Xennials will get* *
*Note:* For those who don't know the difference between a nerd and a geek: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tvy_Pbe5NA (Alphys is both, but that's beside the point.)

9:06 You should try Alphys NEO. She'll mutilate you over 9000 times.

12:36 Anakin Angst to the max.

12:42 Reminiscent of Super Metroid when Mother Brain almost kills Samus.

16:26 I sincerely hope Tobes isn't going for some Goat of Mendes/Baphomet symbolism here. If that's the deal, then he's meddling with powers he can't possibly comprehend.",0,0,2018-10-17T23:22:41.000Z,Judson Joist,UCdPg4Bb2ufdJvxNjmbCytxg,CGlB4-gsmF4,True,UgwNxd0CXCfnrwUbt-B4AaABAg

I think if it were remade it wouldn't be very fun.

"I love this movie, eventhough I only discoverd it 5 Years ago. I still dont understand how this went under my radar for soooo long. The theater gimmick thing was also news to me, I would say the idea behind it is quite awesome. Each screening would be a unique experience for People to talk about, but I see what you mean that the other 2 endings on their own do not have enough impact. The TV version kind of nailed that aspect, but it gets tedious when you have the mystery explained 3 different times. As for the reboot, luckily I have no nostalgia for this movie so I am not against them giving it a fresh start. Reboots can be dicey, but they can be done exceptionally well if the People behind it really care. The recent Ducktales reboot is a great example. They changed so much, but its pretty much all for the better and that show turns out to be smarter than it really needs to. Nobody but the Adults will get many references this show throws at you.

"I remember watching the movie with my sister in the early 90s on (I think) FOX and we both really enjoyed it, but I didn't get to see it again until we got cable in the mid 90s where it would occasionally pop up on CInemax during the Summer and by the late 90s it was shown on Comedy Central practically every day.  So my love for the movie runs deep and I don't think anyone I knew growing up disliked it either. I am curious about the original theatrical showing tho, I always wondered if the A and B endings had their own alternate scenes leading up to their conclusion (or possibly throughout the entire movie) that ended up getting cut for the home video release, because otherwise (like you mentioned) the showings for the two endings would've had short runtimes and been rather jarring without the extra exposition.

"The movie is a classic. And I'd hardly call it ""messed up"". Just because it has some parts that children would find scary, doesn't make it a scary movie. The movie is actually fairly upbeat and has positive messages. Just because people became so accustomed to Disney's softer tones for ""kids films"", doesn't mean that was a standard others had to stick to. Hell, Disney themselves make a SUPER dark animated film in The Black Cauldron, one of their best works, which featured zero song & dance segments, and told a great story. For that matter, even The Great Rat Detective and Oliver & Company were ""darker"" than many Disney films. For that matter, Don Bluth's amazing 80s fare was pretty ""dark"" too. The Secret of NIMH is very sombre and dark, as is The Land Before Time. Bluth even severed his relationship with Spielberg, which was highly beneficial to him financially, due to his experiences making TLBT, because Spielberg and Co. made him cut scenes and ""tone it down"", because they felt that a story about dinosaurs meeting possible extinction, and a bunch of baby dinos being chased by a hungry T-Rex *GASP*, might be ""too scary"" for kids. Please, lol.  

But as Jim Henson so succinctly said when making his masterpiece, ""The Dark Crystal"", we need to start making darker fairy tales again. Sometimes, kids need to feel scared, they need to feel unsafe, so that they can learn about those feelings, and come to grips with them.

"4:17 That's a component of Omega Flowey. It only vaguely resembles a goat head. Btw, Baphomet is not an entity but a symbol. It was worshiped by the Knights Templar, though some historians speculate that Baphomet might have actually been some French crusaders' parody of Muhammad. It was only in the 20th century that it was expropriated by Anton LaVey. I might be mistaken about this since some sources contradict each other. All we can do is corroborate what's available. Btw, I'm not the first to speculate on this, but the Genocide route is basically a parody of the LaVeyan ""left-hand path."" Also notice how Sans uses left-handed attacks in retaliation of you choosing to follow the left-hand path. The Hebrew interpretation of the left and right hands, as symbols, is completely different from LaVeyan satanists' interpretation. In the original Hebrew concept, the left hand represents judgment and the right hand represents mercy.

"1:34 What ""gross stuff"" does she mean? At this point, you haven't discovered the gross Cronenberg stuff and the worst she's done so far is lie to you so you'd be a lab rat in her Dungeon Master adventure. Apart from the pathological lying aspect, that's just something nerds do anyway, so it's not really unusual.

2:07 Felicity from 'Arrow' meets Amy from ""Big Bang"" with a hint of Daria Morgendorffer and a smidge of The Bee Girl from Blind Melon's 'No Rain' music video.

2:11 It's a *Psychobilly GEEK-out!* XD (Btw, do you...like...The Reverend Horton Heat?)

2:29 She's like Amy and Sheldon combined!

2:44 Just like Marry Catherine Gallagher.

3:27 Uncultured swine. *\8-P*

3:44 Notice the Annoying Dog in the background. I've always imagined Alphys meeting Ickis there since it looks so much like the junkyard from 'Aaah! Real Monsters!'. Their personalities are so similar. She'd get him into anime and he'd get her into the blues by singing ""The Delta Rune Blues."" That's my headcanon crossover AU.

4:29 As much as I love that music, Frisk is really the one being awkward here, not Alphers. It's like Tobes is taking cues from Rocko's Modern Life (which works perfectly for this sort of cartoon sitcom stuff). But still, Alphys is forced into this awkward situation by the player's lack of options, not due to any social malfeasance on her part. Toby simply doesn't give you the option to explain what's going on. Btw, do you think Alphys is annoying, relatable, or annoyingly relatable? XD

5:30 Here's the part where you can give her the lecture Captain Picard gives Wesley Crusher, the lecture Coach Fortune gives ""Rudy"" Ruettiger in 'Rudy', or the lecture Lisa gives Gary and Wyatt in Weird Science. Or all of the above.

5:45 Toby really stabs us in the SOUL, doesn't he? Just sticks it in and breaks it off.

8:40 She's on the verge of committing treason against nerdkind with a statement like that. She needs to recite the pledge of the Lambda Lambda Lambda Fraternity (or Sorority) and really mean it! Papyrus could help her with that. He could be like the Benny Rodriguez to her Scotty SMOLS.

9:09 Technically, that falls within the purview of ""geeky,"" not ""nerdy."" Most nerds are also geeks, but not all geeks are nerds. Just like how pretty much all weebs are otaku, but not all otaku are weebs.

9:12 What she's describing are really just ""bonus features,"" so to speak. The real reason Undyne feels drawn to Alphys is because of her demure sensitivity that acts as the soothing water to her raging fire. Literally Yin and Yang.

9:41 Papyrus really is the one Alphys needs to be like the Coach Fortune to her Rudy (or the Benny Rodriguez to her Scotty SMOLS). There's a time and place for Undyne's style of tough love, but what Alphys needs right now is Papyrus's manic enthusiasm.

10:17 Wait! That's not fair! You can't lecture Alphys about telling the truth then lie to Undyne! Unless you're being subjective about anime being ""real."" Because the ideals expressed in anime are applicable to real life (like Captain Mike Hamilton from 'Lily C.A.T.' talking about how powerful memories are), so maybe what you mean to say is, ""The *ideals* of anime are real.""

11:02 Some have speculated that that's actually Flowey impersonating Papyrus.

13:48 ""E.M."" = electromagnetic.

13:57 They operate according to hyper-Newtonian physics.

15:28 *Straight Outta Cronenberg!* Btw, ""Here We Are"" is the *dark reprise* of Alphys's leitmotif.

2:35 But they *are* free in their own domain. They should learn to view their mountain home as the Dwarves of Tolkien lore do - as a fortress, not a prison.

Asgore dun wrong, sure, but at least he was trying to do right for his own people. Muffet tried to use economic principles for the good her people. Alphys and Gaster both used Fringe science in an attempt to do the same. Were there *""Unforeseen Consequences?""* Sure, but that's to be expected.

10:29 Anyone who's played the Half-Life games already knows what that's like. Except those games let you save anywhere, anytime. It's usually only quicksaves or autosaves that get you stuck in endless dethlo0ps, but you can typically just manually load up the previous one.

"My experience with Trial by Fire is unique and I totally understand people coming to it with no context nowadays and coming away far differently than I did.

I actually got this game when it came out, and I had already played QfG1.  First heard about it in a PC Gaming magazine and was dazzled by what I saw.  Not only that, the magazine itself had a large article about it and explained some of the game's more difficult puzzles, so rather than banging my 11-year-old head against the wall, getting frustrated and quitting, I instead was able to breeze through the harder stuff and focus on the world building.

Unfortunately, my PC at the time was not quite capable of handling the game perfectly, so while I beasted my way through, it was a slow and clunky beasting.

Fast forward to about nine years later when I had a modern PC (for the time) and the QfG Collection came out on CD, and it was like coming home to an old friend I'd forgotten had slowdown.  Then my GameFAQs guides happened and here we are today.

Also, Rose, I'll note you didn't mention that the combat in this game is by far one of the weakest in the series.  Very little strategy necessary.  The attack button can pretty much be mashed to the end of days, but then, the combat in these games across the board was never very great, except for a brush with some interesting concepts in QfG4.",0,0,2018-10-13T14:34:35.000Z,CyricZ,UCcr3S-YZJxZJReTNedGYbZA,8HsokM86nxU,True,UgynoKLcWzbT7Sj8QzR4AaABAg

"The first duty of every nerd is to the truth! Whether scientific truth, historical truth, or personal truth! It is the guiding principle upon which the Sage's Quest is based! If you can't find it in yourself to stand up for the truth...you don't deserve to wear that lab coat. * *cue the Picard Song* *

0:44 I'm not a big fan of being lied to, but still, the fact that someone would go through all that trouble just to be my fwend...I find that flattering! XD

0:51 All of that is just an ulterior motive (Alphys has at least several of those). She was actually trying to at least slow down if not halt your progress because she's loyal to Asgore and knows what you have to do. All the other stuff is secondary to that. Besides, if you ask me, she made Hotland a lot more interesting. Though, I would have preferred more danger and more excitement in the style ofSolstice mixed with Prince of Persia (but with non-lethal traps), maybe with an American Gladiators/American Ninja Warrior motif (which Mettaton would love, especially if he could host it). Come to think of it, that sort of thing would be right up Undyne's alley.

1:05 It's called being a Dungeon Master. All nerds do that (even if they don't play D&D). *\8-P*

2:10 Part of me wants to congratulate her for taking initiating in battling her own inferiority complex. Having dealt with (and still dealing with it sometimes) that sort of thing, myself, I know what it's like. Though lying isn't the way to do it. She could have been like, ""Hey, you w-wanna take park in a g-game show?"" And then explained that she's basically the Dungeon Master and Mettaton's the host and you're the contestant and whatnot. Still, Toby's use of irony is delicious. The specific irony I mean is how Alphys is acting as your guide, but you're actually the one guiding her toward rebuilding her life. That stabs me in the soul. ""You're tearing me apart, Toby!"" Oh, and here are some quotes for when you're feeling the way Alphys does.

""When are you gonna learn that people will like you for who you are, not for what you can give them."" ~Lisa, Weird Science

""In this lifetime, you don't have to prove nuthin' ta nobody...except yourself!"" ~Coach Fortune, 'Rudy'

2:37 'The Running Man' meets Smash TV (which was inspired by 'The Running Man'). If I didn't mention it already, he reminds me of Damon Killian.

5:20 Did you ever see 'The Eighth Man', '8 Man', or '8 Man After'? The premise goes something like this - and stop me if this sounds familiar. They're about a *scientist* who puts the *spirit/ghost* of a cop into a *robot body* with *hyper-advanced combat features* (including but not limited to super-speed). Basically Robocop meets The Flash. Mettaton could totes cosplay as 8 Man.

7:16 Tobes, you're a genius! XD

15:00 At least she's a ""compulsive"" liar and not a ""pathological"" liar. * *researches* * Oh, wait. Those are the same thing. Okay, so maybe she *is* ""that."" Well, that just means she needs guidance, not condemnation.

The reason for that was that my dad had epilepsy, so I knew what a seizure looked like but not a panic attack. As a kid I had no idea why Toaster shut the vacuum off and that suddenly stopped the seizure, it made no sense to me! However, as an adult, I can see that it was indeed supposed to be a panic attack and the scene makes way more sense that way.

"Aside from the Giger art, it seems to draw influence from David Lynch and Stephen King. Like Twin Peaks meets The Tommyknockers.

3:57 Are we really expected to trust an entity that looks like Giger's rendition of Shodan? Wait, this predates System Shock by two years, so maybe that's where Shodan got her sense of style (basically H. R. Giger meets William Gibson). ""Hack the Giger?""

7:18 Cut the mullet! Cut the mullet! Cut the mullet! *CUT THE MULLLLET!* (It's funnier if you've heard that song.)

Note: I had a mullet in 1992. #mulletshaming

7:54 Did you ever see Galaxy of Terror? It has Robert Englund and Sig Haig in it before they were famous. The best parts of it looked and felt kinda like that scene right there.

"1:39 I hate that sort of fake-ass soap opera kissing with those awful soap opera mouth noises. You're getting paid *something* at least, so put *a little* effort into it! Sheesh! The Princess Bride kicks the shit out that shit.

3:00 That's pretty much what Spoony said about the lanky nerd (Curtis) you plays as in the second one. He even mentions that Curtis looks like The Angry Video Game Nerd.
*Fuse Box Count: 42*

5:08 ""Tell me about the rabbits, George.""

6:22 So many opportunities to insert Undertale references. XD Btw, authentic Chicago-style deep dish rules! Anyone who can't tell the difference between genuine-article deep dish and just a thick pan pizza is an idiot!

8:49 Some people might say that. Some people don't know the difference between B-movies and Z-movies (think Evil Dead 2 versus Manos: The Hands of Fate). ""Some people are stupid."" Yeah, that last part meant as a Borderlands 2 reference.

10:53 That's because preachy Ferngully/Captain Planet messages come across as heavy-handed, ham-fisted, self-righteous hypocrisy in the style of Ted Turner.",0,0,2018-10-11T20:44:33.000Z,Judson Joist,UCdPg4Bb2ufdJvxNjmbCytxg,YOOI0O69jCs,True,Ugy_fBjR29jzHkJo0fp4AaABAg
"0:15 Speaking of ""So Sorry,"" I used to do collabs with Sammy D. Butterdragon on deviantART (years before Undertale was even a twinkle in Toby's imagination-go-nuts).

0:44 There's a pun that deserves a rimshot. XD The Beetlejuice cartoon was chock of full of these sorts of puns, but it was before Toby's time. Maybe he watched it on DVD in his early teens. I'm only speculating, of course. I see a lot of Jhonen Vasquez-like influences going on in the Underverse too also as well.

1:22 My mindbrain also interpreted ""make"" as ""mark"" at first. Probably because there's a natural association between ""tile"" and ""mark.""

2:35 Heh...do you know the origin of the heart shape? Also, have you played Undertale Yellow?

3:20 That really hits me where I live. And I know it hits you there too.

4:32 I think one of them has a line of dialog that involves ""love and peace."" Who doesn't like Trigun?

9:00 Well, that's his job, so I wouldn't hold it against him. He's not just a sentry. He's a sentinel. Anything worth doing is worth doing at 100% maximum power.

Note: Alphys NEO puts Sans to shame. I like to think of ""NEO"" as meaning either ""New Erudite Order"" or ""Nano-Enhanced Organism.""

10:34 / 11:04 It's cool that Toby shows us the everyday lives of blue-collar workers in the Underground. Alphys's ""meddling"" probably means buku overtime for them.

11:04 Is it just me or does that hard-hat creature remind you of those hard-hat robots from Mega Man? Btw, those hard-hat robots have several names, but one of them happens to be ""Mettool."" *Mett* -ool.

12:07 Ever consider doing a playthru of Space Quest 2: Vohaul's Revenge? Any Space Quest game, really, but that one's the best.

13:09 Pretty sure it's intended to be pronounced ""twenty-ex-teen."" You like, like ""twenty-exty-six.""

15:48 I wonder if that monster's name is ""Lefty.""

16:28 In Undertale Yellow, you play as Clover (who becomes the Soul of Justice), the former owner of that revolver.

Note: ""If it took more than one shot, you weren't using a Jakobs.""

17:05 ""Welcome to Glam Burger, home of the Glamburger, can I take your order?"" XD

18:12 Burgerpants seems like the jumped right out of an early '90s Spumco cartoon.

19:40 Heh...""Labyrinth.""

19:43 Revolution! The only solution! The armed response of an entire nation!

19:55 Cult of personality just like Damon Killian from 'The Running Man'. Mettaton is such a hypocrite. He sabotages Alphys's plans (and humiliates her by revealing her intimate secrets) even though he treats his ""underlings"" far worse than she treats him. Now sure, he has a legit grievance that's worthy of protest for the sake of redress, but that sort of thing must be carried out with integrity and always for the right reasons. Instead, his hypocritical method of ""protest"" comes across as a ""tantrum.""

Note: Papyrus isn't a narcissist, he's an egoist. Mettaton is the narcissist. Also, Sans isn't a nihilist. Chara is.",0,0,2018-10-11T20:15:20.000Z,Judson Joist,UCdPg4Bb2ufdJvxNjmbCytxg,NpjDe9J7qr8,True,UgxxkVb4Lpz75FjOrmR4AaABAg

"So you were basically Alphys when you were younger but with less of a Marc Maron sense of humor and more Daria Morgendorffer.

0:29 I used to make mix tapes of video game music in the late '80s/early '90s when I had a mullet.

0:41 Not enough people do enough of that. Btw, what's your MBTI type?

0:58 Do you dig dadaism, surrealism, or absurdism?

1:17 I was in a place similar to that at that age except I was a short skinny runt (sort of the Ickis to your Alphys just to make things simple). I was ""smart"" (which is really the result of curiosity, not a character trait in itself) but often unmotivated.

2:00 As a S.T.A.L.K.E.R., it helps to be at least a little crazy. I know that's not the kind of ""stalker"" you mean, but still.

2:13 Did you ever see Firestarter, Graveyard Shift, or Sleepwalkers? Brad Dourif *is* the reason to watch Graveyard Shift. It's only too bad they didn't do more with his awesome character, Tucker Cleveland. Dourif is *Method Alpha Foxtrot!*

3:35 That's some genuine-article tragedy right there. I felt nothing when my dad died, but our relationship was the opposite or yours. He was more like how you describe your teachers as being - harsh and without understanding.

9:55 That's about where I was at that age (minus the ""doing much better"" part).

10:50 What do you think of the Space Quest games? More specifically, the first two (generally regarded as the best - according to me - especially the second one).

11:33 Do you...like...Peasant's Quest?

12:19 Martial arts are excellent for this sort of thing. Lots of people with troubled minds find liberation in the mental focus trained by the discipline of martialism. I found my outlet in the Jidokwan style of Taekwondo. Unleash your inner Undyne!

"Doug Walker hates this show (but only because his name's ""Doug""). Doug Funnie is an INFP, whereas Doug Walker is an ENTP.

0:45 That's exactly what I liked about it! XD But then, I ""grew up"" (yeah, right) in the Cold War era of radiation, genetic mutation, nuclear annihilation, and toxic waste. Oh, and Killer Tomatoes.

0:53 Ickis was the Nicktoon character I related to the most. Btw, Doug's cognitive capabilities are super-advanced for an 11-1/2-year-old. Also, he has the same psychometric profile (or rather, I should say ""fits the same archetypal profile"") as Rocko but with more avidly expressed right-brain traits.

2:05 The name ""Brian"" is used for multiple side characters in different episodes. In one, there's even a computer named ""Brian.""

2:32 You're not going to say anything about that donut costume?!

6:06 But...nematodes *do* exist....

6:55 Fun Fact: Mr. Bone was based on Barney Fife.

7:20 I'm in my late 30s and I still remember that one part in that one episode where Roger talks about a tree that punches people. *XD*

7:31 Oh, it was totes mine. Still is, actually. *\8-P* 'Doug' wasn't surreal *enough* for me.

9:34 Columbo was also parodied by Buster Bunny on at least one episode of Tiny Toons. Notice how Doug almost nails the eye thing except it's the wrong eye. Peter Falk lost his right eye at an early age and had a glass eye for most of his life.

9:44 I always appreciated those references, but maybe because I was the same age as the character. Plus, my mom watched 'Columbo'.

9:58 * *cough, cough* * Rocko's Modern Life * *cough, cough* *

10:09 Porkchop must be left-handed just like Doug (and Jimi Hendrix).

13:32 Acapella. Speaking of which, have you heard Smooth McGroove's acapella renditions of Undertale songs? Also, did you ever watch 'Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego'? Remember the band Rockapella? They're from Indiana. Hoosiers, represent!

15:23 Talking Heads! They were one of my faves alongside Oingo Boingo, R.E.M., Thomas Dolby, Herbie Hancock, and Billy Idol. Also, you totally blew an opportunity to insert an Undertale reference when Doug mentions ""trashcan."" XD

16:28 ""...both *he* and Campbell....""

19:08 I knew you'd go there...because I would have too. *\8-P*

21:25 In the '80s, it was M.A.S.K., C.O.P.S. (not to be confused with ""Cops""), and Inspector Gadget. Also Sectaurs but no one remembers them. And of course, Knight Rider, The Dukes of Hazzard, and The A-Team. Maybe The Equalizer (actually I just liked the intro).

"""Another Medium"" (the Hotland theme) sounds like the sort of thing Black Mesa scientists listen to on their way to work.

2:49 Meta commentary par excellence. Alphys is completely unaware that she's doing exactly what she's describing and is repressed by her own control-freak tendencies.

3:28 ""Not bad, not bad."" ~Mordecai, Borderlands 1 & 2

6:50 *""The smell* of cobwebs *fills the air""* is grammatically correct because ""of cobwebs"" is a prepositional phrase. I wouldn't be surprised if Toby had been classically trained in typography (like me) which is an aspect of graphic design.

7:46 She might look like a spider monster, but she has the soul of a Ferengi. Oh, well. Better a Ferengi than a Neimoidian. XD

10:10 This is just like that scene from Vampire Hunter D (the first one) where the Snake Women of Midwich capture D. They're snake creatures instead of spider creatures, but it's the same principle...in theory. They even talk about draining his life force.

"Every time Alphers calls or updates her status, you have to say, *""You're killin' me, SMOLS!""* XD

0:31 Helga Pataki is a good example of a tsundere-like archetype in Western animation. She's from 'Hey Arnold!' which I never watched.

2:34 To you get the orange and blue symbolism here? The colors correspond with Yin (blue) and Yang (orange). Yin is passive, so to not contradict it/take damage, you have to let it ""flow through you"" (so to speak). Yang is active, so to not contradict it/take damage, you have to actively move through it.

3:06 Because you're the Yin to her Yang, Alphers! Notice how she says that right after explaining how the Yin and Yang lasers work, completely oblivious to the fact that she and Undyne represent the same ""mojo"" as those lasers.

4:16 Alphys is most likely dyslexic anyway, so it's not like she's judging you. XD

5:44 Whenever she successfully ""hacks"" something, you have to say, ""Your Kung Fu is the best"" (in reference to The X-Files and The Lone Gunmen). Because she's totally Langley.

6:25 Technically, she *is* fire since she's one of the elemental-type monsters.

11:00 * *cue 'Human Rocket' by Devo* *

13:30 Alphys totally blows a chance for a genuine-article ""nerd-out"" here (most of her ""nerd-outs"" are actually ""geek-outs""). Sheldon Cooper would call that a ""buzzkill.""

"3:00 In other words, Vash, Knives, and Wolfwood. Pretty sure Tobes is a Trigun fan. Or at least, I wouldn't be surprised if he was. One of the Royal Guards even mentions ""love and peace!"" I also wouldn't be surprised if Tobes had drawn at least a little inspirado from the Beetlejuice cartoon. Funny thing is, a lot of the influences I see throughout the story are - or at least appear to be - from pop culture media that was before his time. Maybe those themes are just *that* timeless.

3:49 Last I recall, lust is as much a vice as vengeance. And let's not forget greed. Or my favorite - gluttony. *};-P*

4:11 Did you ever see 'Labyrinth'?

4:39 Evil villain? I always saw him as an ambitious egoist (not narcissist, there's a difference) trying to make his way in the world. On the one hand, he's trying to do his duty (with gusto), but on the other hand, he's trying to do it with a sense of chivalry and sportsmanship like the famous duel from 'The Princess Bride'. This embodies the philosophy of deontology (summed up as, ""it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game"") which generally falls within the purview of Lawful Good.

5:00 Burgerpants looks like he jumped right out of a John K. cartoon! *XD*

5:14 That's what I feel like when I *don't* eat.

5:52 As a foodie, I'd recommend nutmeg with butterscotch pie rather than cinnamon. It's more...rustic. At any rate, it's good to see that monsters - like humans - are in touch with their ""inner hobbit."" *\8-P*

6:28 There's a Clive Barker movie called 'Nightbreed'. It's the closest thing there is to an Undertale movie and it came out in 1990, a year before Toby was born. Humans are the bad guys. Sort of. Technically, it ties in with the Hellraiser mythos, so what it's really depicting is a sort of Balkanization of warring factions (each corresponding with different D&D alignments) with humans caught in between. And we're at least as evil as any other faction and perfectly capable of doling out ""Max Damage"" (Carmageddon reference).",0,0,2018-10-10T14:10:13.000Z,Judson Joist,UCdPg4Bb2ufdJvxNjmbCytxg,sudui4UuC2o,True,UgxMMs1EWXGRuZWEriV4AaABAg

I took a man to a graveyard
I beg your pardon, it's quite hard enough
Just living with the stuff I have learned

The ashes of both of my parents have gone through my hands as I bid them farewell.  After my dad died I realized I hadn't really gotten over my mom's death almost seventeen years ago.  As I look at what I've done in my thirty one years of existence, and ponder what kind of future I'm heading toward, one word keeps coming up in my thoughts;

Worthless...

"2:52 Totally a Ben Linus vibe (at first). Then you meet her and she turns out to be Ickis from 'Aaah! Real Monsters!' cosplaying as Lisa Simpson. XD By comparison, her Underfell counterpart is more like Herbert West, Elijah C. Skuggs, Margaret Canker, and Fawful all rolled into one.

3:28 I could totes imagine Charlie Adler voicing both Alphys and Undyne using variations of his Ickis and Bev Bighead voices.

3:41 Best leitmotif ever. Bonetrousle is still my fave, but when it comes to music that matches a character, this theme is just perfect. Notice how the first 30 seconds or so are intentionally off-key to emphasize her awkwardness, but then it takes on a vibe that embodies her sense of whimsy.

Note: I used to work in a lab (in an orthopedics plant) that had walls that were that exact same shade of sickly hospital green. Same blue tiles too.

8:30 I've been in that exact same situation before except it was jalapeno bratwursts. XD

9:45 Mettaton's attitude reminds me of Damon Killian from 'The Running Man'.

11:09 Possibly implying that she might have been overriding that Snowdin puzzle.

11:14 Even her desk looks like mine! At least I'm not the only one who still uses Post-Its. Btw, in my headcanon, she's ambidextrous and dyslexic (a common combo among geniuses who use both hemispheres of their brain together) with a tendency to write in left-handed cursive when she's feeling flustered or in a hurry which would explain the bad handwriting.

Note: Walter Bishop from 'Fringe' (who has a lot of Alphys-like traits) writes in exceedingly neat, almost calligraphy-like, left-handed cursive. He's played by John Noble who's probably best known for having played King Theodin from TLoTR.

11:41 Alphys is so much fun to psychoanalyze! We can tell so much about her by her lab-house. All over the place are details that display the inner workings of an ironically well-balanced mindbrain. By that, I mean she exhibits both left-brain and right-brain traits. Technically, everyone does, but not everyone does it with this kind of panache. Plus, most people (real or fictional) tend to display a notable left- or right-brain preference. For example, Sans is a left-brain introvert (like PewDiePie), whereas Papyrus is a right-brain extrovert (like Jack Scepticeye). Alphys seems to have an introverted right brain and an extroverted left brain (like me).

"I loved he movie as a kid. If I remember correctly, movies, outside of disney...amd sometimes disney..had no problems tackling issues and bringing them to kids. The way I see it, there are forces OUTSIDE our parents that help raise us. It's the reason a good parent can end up with a bad child, especially when the area they live in has so many pressuring bad forces surrounding them. Therefore.,,I believe the ,ovies we watch, music we hear, games we play, and friends we have..and so on and so on...are all elements that help us become who we are as adults.
Now...for movies, games, show, music...these are VERY small parts. They don't themselves influence us. However, what we're taught by our parents, and what we see others around us doing..,if it's reinforced by those mediums, it creates an atmostphere...and THAT helps guide us.
All that is to say...of course we shouldn't allow our kids to watch whatever R rated ,ovies comes out every summer..,but a ,ovies like this...saying, ""kids CAN watch it but adults will take more from it"" kinda sounds like you're saying, ""kids don't really need to watch something like this because (of this reason)."".
But for this movie...the reason is that it introduces situations that we think kids just don't get or understand, or shouldn't be introduced to. And that's what I have a problem with. We're supposed to raise our kids to be functioning adults, yet we are afraid to introduce our kids to even small elements of what they would have to deal with. 
I believe, that we should instead, like my parents, just communicate better. Explain things. Like this ,ovies doesn't just say things about suicide. The whole scene..of the junkyard cars...is that of certain people still fighting to reach their goals or just be happy and of those who just gave up. And the one thing in common as humans...we d ONT ACTUALLY WANT to die. We want survive and reach our goals. So the whole scene shows the results of those who give up. And it reinforces the fact that YOU don't want to be them...those who give up and give in. Further reinforced by the main characters. It's not dark. It's a message based in reality.
But...its a message that a child can only understand if they have the parents that teach that way of thinking...which you can't teach that way if you're only trying to avoid it all together. 
Of course a child with a bad home environment will possibly see those who give in, and relate..and be stuck on that part. No one to show them the meaning of those moments. And even if they tried...the environment that beats them down emotionally every day is teaching them otherwise. 
And kids need something to anchor them back to. Something they learn God A, if it relates to something they saw beforehand..they can und3rstand it even more. So they .ca watch this movie, not FULLY understand every nuance. But when they finally have the talks, the experience, or it just clicks, they can go back to those moments and see that even that movie had that message.",0,0,2018-10-10T00:36:23.000Z,Agon Leed,UC6nOawiI2Rt8Ns1p77cyX2g,VcPtVwOu9QY,True,Ugya1T2XIOZJJrHr9IR4AaABAg

"I was never afraid of this movie, but I always found it overwhelmingly sad. It's funny, because to this day I have a hard time letting *anything* go, and I always try to repair things or run them to the ground. Like, when I built a new computer recently, I felt just so sad about retiring my old computer that I had for years. I felt like I was being so unfair to it by replacing it, even though it never failed me. I shed a tear when I placed it in an empty room and saw it sitting all alone as I pulled the door close. Then, the next day, I went to turn it on to transfer a few files from it. I opened File Explorer, and for the first time, it completely locked up. When I attempted to boot the computer again, it wouldn't POST, giving me a memory controller error code.

7:40 If the old regime were to collapse or be overturned in some sort of revolution or something, and assuming that nobody instituted something like a junta regime or whatnot (which Undyne does in one timeline), then the Royal Guard could reform into a People's Militia.

"I've read the book, and seen the movie; I didn't care much for the latter because, well, the reasons are numerous but the level of silliness got beyond obnoxious, and did so very quickly.
The idea that the appliances are semi-sentient to fully sentient I can accept, but the movie takes this and runs a marathon of silly with it, and it isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for me, it just doesn't click. There are plenty of movies that are both original material and sourced from other media that fall under this category, and are even worse than The Brave Little Toaster in this regard (so much so that the movie in discussion doesn't make the Top 50 list), so this isn't isolated in any way. On the contrast, the book was much more relatable, had more depth, and was just better in comparison, but that's just me. In contrast, I liked the Homeward Bound movies more than I liked the novel The Incredible Journey, but then again, the adaptation of the story from the novel to the movie was about as loose as the God of War game series was with Greek Mythology (because mainly there was no beef between Sparta and Greece, only a small number of seceded people looking to invade Greece and claim the land as theirs).",1,0,2018-10-09T19:37:10.000Z,Amy Carter,UC-1y-GhPYzXqOhsH3F7gISg,VcPtVwOu9QY,True,Ugw7i2aZiLMj1DBjJM14AaABAg

I watch them in an old VCD, and I believe both are made in 1997 to 1998.

"0:29 I get the impression it's meant to be pronounced ""twenty-ex-teen."" Btw, if Mt. Ebott is in Ireland (as speculated by Gaijin Goomba), then the humans who conjured the Barrier were probably Celt-Gaelic Druids. If that's the case, then the Romans did the same thing to their Celt-Briton cousins that they did to the monsters in the form of Hadrian's Wall.

2:01 I wonder if anyone's ever thought of the name ""Midian"" in reference to the Clive Barker film 'Nightbreed'. It's the closest thing there is to an Undertale movie and it came out in 1990, a year before Toby was born. If Tobes gives the go-ahead for an Undertale movie, let's hope Guillermo del Toro directs it. Alternate choices would be Tim Burton, Timur Bekmambetov, and/or Shane Acker.

5:54 Can't say that I'd blame them. Remember when Gordon Freeman went to Xen? Except in this case, your being an ""Interloper"" (get it?) in their domain wasn't really your fault. Or was it? In Gordon's case, he was just doing what he had to do, but the Nihilanth probably thought it was doing the same. Btw, Gaster is The G-Man and Undertale 2 is Half-Life 3 confirmed!

7:06 Notice the nostrils dilating and contracting like a real frog's nostrils. Subtle details like that impress me in the mindbrain!

8:08 That music reminds me of a NES game but I can't quite place which one. Maybe TMNT or Werewolf: The Last Warrior.

8:48 A better test for that sort of thing would possibly incorporate some Prince of Persia-style traps (minus the spikes and whatnot).

9:20 Imagine her saying ""hello"" in the voice of Penelope Wilton. *X3*

9:58 Imagine her yelling, ""FRESH!"" and slapping you with a purse. *\8-P*

12:29 Nutmeg would probably work better with butterscotch than cinnamon.

13:05 Just like a real frog! Have you ever looked closely at a real frog's frogface? Or a toad for that matter? Their nostrils are constantly doing their thing and their throats are constantly fluttering. Is ""fluttering"" the right word? You know what I mean.

"Terrifying? This was one of my childhood faves! Actually, I appreciate it even more as a so-called ""grown-up"" because now I actually ""get"" it.

2:32 'It's a B-movie Show' was my favorite song and my favorite part of the movie (both then and now).

2:42 Undertale music fits perfectly with The Brave Little Toaster! XD Actually, both stories explore vaguely similar themes. Blooky and Blanky should hang out together and talk about music and emo stuff. Everyone needs to get in touch with their emo side.

2:50 I was 7 in 1987. That's also the year Evil Dead 2 came out.

3:02 I enjoyed the taboo-breaking aspect of intentional fear induction even as a kid. Even more as a teen. I consider myself fortunate that I've never lost that.

3:11 Don't forget about Mr. St. Peters' ""Amalgamates.""

3:22 / 6:22 * *insert Killer Klowns from Outer Space reference* *

3:26 I'm in my late 30s and I became professionally obsolete in my early 20s, so yeah. That hits me right in the *CORE* of my *SOUL.*

5:21 Well, that explains the Undertale music.

6:22 ""See a rubber nose on a painted face - Bringing *Genocide* to the human race - Time to take a ride on the nightmare merry-go-round""

8:22 * *cue the True Lab theme (""Here We Are"")* * Seriously, you could have spliced in Undertale music all the way through this and it would have fit the whole way through. I bet you could play 'It's a B-Movie Show' in the True Lab and it would fit there too.

8:57 Literally ""hopes and dreams.""

10:32 Rob = Alphys (who was originally written as a male character). Christine = Undyne. Toaster = Frisk. Maybe in some other crossover AU, Gaster would play the role of Rob and Alphys's Underfell counterpart would play the role of St. Peters.

12:31 He's only insecure because he has no means of fulfilling his purpose. Security *is* his purpose which makes his insecurity ironic.

13:24 Genderless, eh? Where have we heard that before in the year 201X (twenty-ex-teen)?

15:15 The anti-Flowey.

16:29 No one really ""gets"" this story until they're a so-called ""grown-up"" and have worked enough jobs to know how expendable they really are.

17:40 * *cue Megalovania* *

18:37 'The Brave Little Toaster' was produced by Hyperion. What kinds of movies did Maliwan make? Probably sci-fi noir. Jakobs would have made Westerns. Torgue would do action movies. Dahl would do war films. Vladof would do propaganda films. Tediore would do lame B-movies (as opposed to good B-movies like Street Trash). Atlas would do adventure epics.

"I really don't understand why people have given this movie this reputation of being ""scary"" or ""messed up"" more so than... well.... just about ANYTHING before, after or of the time. It's not any more so ""messed up"" than Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Unico And The Island Of Magic, All Dogs Go To Heaven, The Mouse And His Child (Seriously, it's obscure but look THAT one up) or Secret Of NIMH, or pretty much anything else that had a healthy dose of some good old nightmare fuel mixed in with it's general storytelling. 

As a young teenager, almost EVERYTHING I watched, obscure and mainstream alike had this balance in it, and this just seemed par for the course of things as a kid and as a teenager that I watched which treated me maturely as if I could handle scenes and moments like it. 

I just don't get this obsessive fascination that people today have with brandishing everything little nostalgic thing with ""this was too much for my poor little brain to handle"" or ""this one specific thign was so scary and creepy wtf?"" 

I always just felt like this was the standard for good entertainment, back then, since it happened so regularly in everything that stuck with me after the fact. To me it just meant something was good and that it didn't look down on me and treated me like someone who could handle such things in their storytelling. This movie was NO different to me. It was good because it made me think and it let me handle and process complicated emotions like pity, sympathy, fear, sadness, loss, and characters overcoming or dealing with what they fear. But I never thought it was out of the ordinary. It just seemed to be what EVERYTHING I watched was doing. 

Maybe I just got desensitized very early at my age, I dunno. I WAS watching Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th movies even as a very young lad. But I have a feeling this wasn't just it. Even though weirdly enough it was two episode of my favorite cartoon, Ren and Stimpy, both Stimpy's Invention and the final scenes of Sven Hoek that scared me the most (which I loved. I was literally chatting and talking about it with everyone around me after that). So what do I know?

"I have a weird connection to things that promotes staying ""young at heart"".  People typically wrongfully equate this trait as being childish or immature but in reality it's always seemed to be just the opposite to me.  It always seemed like the ability to enjoy life and the things in life regardless of how old you are.  It's understanding and appreciating things that aren't totally meant for you.  It's an adult watching the Ducktales reboot and remembering and enjoying it for what it is before going off to work in corporate America and making a living.  It's being able to relate to people who are a decade or two younger than you because you've kept up with all aspects of life and not just an immensely myopic slice that was hand fed to you.  It's being able to joke around, take a joke and make a joke without getting insulted or offended because you don't understand how life works anymore.

Just from personal observation (as I'm not really old enough yet for this to apply to me) people who stay young at heart are capable of empathy to a greater degree and are less likely to follow certain political trends that seem to be favored by the old and bitter.   I'd rather not get political but I've seen people over time lose their ""young at heart"" trait and they invariably shrivel up into bitter Fox News watching husks of their former selves and it's immensely sad.  Instead of finding the joy in life and seeing the joy in other people's lives they'd rather get angry and defensive and tribal.",1,0,2018-10-09T15:00:35.000Z,xxCrazyIzzyxx,UCzk8NXfBwVH5pHs1uP7nKCw,UEumh00w4og,True,UgzugQCPNO7cmRt3n8B4AaABAg

Nobody wanted to produce the movie, but it was a passion project for Lassiter, so he kept pitching it.

"I really liked your analysis of the feature and the novella.  I honestly had no idea the animation was an adaptation from the written word.

However, I never looked at the scenes you described as dark or horrifying.  I just felt it was the personification of inanimate objects in order for the viewer to relate or connect to the characters.  I also would have to admit that I saw other animated features, based on books, that in today's world would not be considered for the better interest of children, though in the times they were written and adapted to animation, that was the exact demographic the studios were aiming for, and because of that, maybe my ""shit is scary"" meter was disarmed.  Titles that come to mind are ""The Secret of NIMH"", based on the book, ""Mrs. Frisby And The Rats of NIMH"" (they changed her name to Brisby in the animated feature to avoid any litigation by the Frisbee Company), and ""Watership Down"", based on the novel of the same name.  Both of those features show some dark content, especially with Watership.  If you have ever seen either of them, I would really enjoy your review of them as you had done here.  If you have not seen either of them, I highly recommend them, both animation and the literature!

Very nice work you did here.  I loved this cartoon when I was growing up, and I feel you did a great review of it.  I hope to see more of this on your channel in the near future!  Cheers!",1,0,2018-10-09T07:04:40.000Z,The FUSS,UC9OpGrIchYZ9gs9Kdk6EiNw,VcPtVwOu9QY,True,Ugy2yIpclrsfy62CvIV4AaABAg

"I consider this film to be one of the best animated films of all time, maybe even one of the best films period. It's so heart-crushingly terrifying/depressing/hopeless, more than any other film has ever been to me.

I will always remember the junkyard scene, and the feeling of utter despair you feel as the protagonists are fruitlessly fleeing from that terrifying magnet to no avail.

"I knew that Philip K. Dick accused Polish science fiction author, Stanislaw Lem, in his letter to the FBI, but I didn't know he accused Disch. I think Dick was suffering from schizophrenia when he wrote that letter. His life was pretty much turning into A Scanner Darkly at that point. His issue with Lem was over an article Lem wrote about American science fiction being derivative or uninspired, even though Lem was a fan of Dick's books.  I don't know what Dick's issue was with Disch. That subplot in The Word of God sounds like something that may have actually happened in Dick's nightmares.

"Thank you so much for covering this. TBLT is one of my favorite animated movies of all time, and had a huge influence on me as a kid. 

I remember before the IMDb boards were removed, the one about the movie had a lot of thread discussions about the movie's thematic elements and the underlying symbolism and metaphors - especially in the song numbers that were laced in religious undertones with ""City of Lights"" and glimmers of mental health in ""Worthless"". What I remember most was a thread deconstructing Worthless, and how the most haunting story from the perspective of the cars was that of the green pickup truck, and his story about being on living on a Hopi reservation. Maybe we were putting too much thought into it back then, but his story (on top of him being the only one who drove to his death rather than fight) being contrasted with the suicide rates for indigenous people makes it all the more dark.

Overall, it's great to see more people talk about the film. It's criminally underrated, and it always saddens me when people say they don't remember it or they never cared for it.",3,0,2018-10-08T18:16:32.000Z,SirChubbyBunny,UC6o09gHmHJH9N3WgloHlQnA,VcPtVwOu9QY,True,UgxTKWcvuGX9fYW9Ivl4AaABAg

"The history of the movie itself is just fascinating, especially seeing the people who worked on it.
John Lasseter was actually supposed to be the director of this whole movie. It would've been a mix of traditionally animated characters in a CG environment. The Disney execs at the time shut the idea down (ironic since this was not long after Tron came out), and even fired him after the pitch. He didn't really have much to do with the final film, aside from designing the characters, by then he was already at Pixar. Speaking of...
This film is notable for having a lot of people working on it that would later become well-known Disney and Pixar alumni. Director and writer Jerry Rees went on to make many Disney Park attractions. Co-writer Joe Ranft became head writer for many of the Pixar films, and also became an essential member of the studio (and according to rumors, he was John Lasseter's right hand). Glen Keane, Kirk Wise and Kevin Lima became prominent figures of the Disney Renaissance as animators and directors. Mark Dindal also directed some notable films later on, like Emperor's New Groove and Cats Don't Dance. Rob Minkoff went on to direct The Lion King and Stuart Little. And this is just a small list of all the animators, who went on to make landmark films at Disney and Pixar. And of course, we know how John Lasseter became the face of Pixar and their storytelling, later also became head of Disney Animation where he also revived the studio and etc.
And while it is true that it became a non-Disney film, I think it was almost produced by them, as well. Ron Miller, then president/CEO of Disney, experimented with dark films at the time, such as The Black Hole, Watcher in the Woods and Something Wicked This Way Comes. So this would've aligned perfectly to his repeortire. I'm not sure if this shifted studios after Miller stepped down and got replaced by daddy of daddies Michael Eisner, but all I know is that it got bought by Hyperion Pictures, which was founded by a former Disney studio head.",35,5,2018-10-08T18:07:43.000Z,Mike Kobela,UC6u1ypd4Nifa85Qe2GZVoOA,VcPtVwOu9QY,True,UgzZ7RWr5Hx_EmQ5UOd4AaABAg

"This movie ""feels"" like Haunted Honeymoon to me. I can't explain it better than ""feels"". I just like the tone of a suspense/Haunted house movie made with a comedic backbone. For me going all the way back to ""The ghost and Mr. Chicken"". I know we're similar films b4 that. But it was a perfect mix of the genre's IMO. It's real hard to get the right ratio. Done improperly can make the film feel like a failed attempt at each or at both genre. Far as a remake goes. Usual rules apply. Initial response from existing fans will be negative. With a chance of that view softening over time......unless they are accused of some sort of bigotry due to the opinion. That will result in a doubling down. You have a good shot at people unfamiliar with the previous version. On a side note....SOB that is a good cast. Any remake is going to have an uphill climb if they try competing with the original.

"I wish I could get back into the older games I grew up with. And in terms of getting scared, my mother loved horror movies and literally watched them right in front of me growing up, but she instilled it into my head that what's on the TV is not real life. It's all made up. So, I knew it wasn't real and loved them too for quite a while. There are movies I saw in the theater at age 10 that I'm shocked nobody gave my parents any trouble about bringing a kid to such movies. And too be fair, many of them are considered so bad they are funny these days. 
        But, yeah. When the depression strikes I still am looking for what to get rid of it besides THC. Oddly enough, the game Rocket League's been my go to coping mechanism not so much for depression but pain and racing thoughts. My parents also didn't have teeth growing up so brushing wasn't something I would think to do so often and boy am I paying for it now. I've still got 3 more appointments, but somehow through the pain I could play that game non-stop and distract myself from it. It even helped focus because now that the main pain makers are gone I don't do so great at the game as I did when I was in constant ""Holy hell I don't want to live with this anymore!"" type thinking. Which... If you're ever in, do your best to not think of how long you've had the pain, try to accept it as if it's always been there and basically practice mindfulness and the pain won't seem so um... Consuming, there we go. 

Oh and welcome back! I had thought you left long long long ago and was surprised to see a video pop up and thought ""Gosh, that's old..."" only to see the date and not know you've been making these again! I can't really handle going back to play the games I grew up with, but love hearing about others who grew up with them too! Guess that's a coping mechanism. I do miss my 90's attention span. Say what you will about kids, I could sit through an adventure game from start to finish when I was little. These days I end up turning it off only to return so long later that I have to restart.",0,0,2018-10-04T11:45:39.000Z,n0nTox!c,UCCyVFOWV4b5TEo6ol7F1HWw,3qYHDXkJnx4,True,UgyOw0ABTdnWRwNn1t14AaABAg

"Thx 4 this review. I also have played entire Blackwell series and loved it, and I think Unavowed brings another top notch storytelling. Highly recommend playing Blackwell series if you like this game. There's also another cameo from Blackwell and that person actually has a part in puzzle solving as well. And thx to this game, I finally learned the profession for those ""ghost whisperer"" thingie here are called Bestower. Speaking of that however...

Got a bit confused with existence of another bestower in this game, particularly with the ending of Blackwell finale. A slight spoiler btw, why there's still ghosts in Unavowed, tho I'm guessing all those in this game are fresh made ones since the event from Blackwell finale.

That aside, there is a slight downer with this game, the soundtrack. They are beautiful, tho most of them felt way too moody/nostalgic feelings, even there are scenes that doesn't really fit with choices of the tunes, like the bad ending for example. That aside, really recommend this game.

"This was a favorite show of mine, but the plots and writing were rather thin. In that same vein as some popular anime from the early 90s and other Viacom children’s programming, it is more about the character development and interaction.

There were two great episodes I remember that dealt mostly with the UFO abduction paranoia and the desert. Particularly, they had some NASA astronauts wandering the desert testing space suits for a future Mars mission, and another, during a Kyle/Brad stranded in the wilderness trope, the rest of the characters whip themselves into a paranoid frenzy that the two were abducted and replaced with impostors.

Rather than a reboot, it would be nice to see more children’s series that could be simple, episodic, yet still boast intriguing characters.

"In 36 aging to 37 and I have to say I loved Doug. The simplicity and almost boring tone of the show was a big aspect of what I enjoyed. The lessons Doug taught were somewhat relatable more than most shows of the era, and because of that I believe I connected with the material more than other shows of the time. The ongoing crush  with patty mayonnaise was an reoccurring plotline that was very intriguing storyline for the pre-pubescent me.  The calm tone to the soundtrack was a bug draw as a kid I lived jazz and lounge elevator style music.

But what really bothers me about this video of that at the beginning of it, you go on and on about how much you loved the show...

"For the time, this show was pretty progressive regarding Danny.  By today's standards, with better access to information and finding out who the nutjobs are, we can see the problems.  Even Zach, in his very stereotypical chief ensemble, was progressive since SBTB did make an effort to have him realize how wrong he way.  It was a start on the train of expanding on cultures in kids's shows.  One episode did literally change my way of thinking that still applies today.  When Ted was being an ass about Danny's culture, Danny challenged Ted to go a set time, I think a week, without using anything that Native Americans had any part in creating.  Ted struggled terribly as he ket finding out that everything had, in some way, come from Native Americans, whether it was a dye or a fabric type.  That made *me* realize that everything we use on a daily basis almost always stems from other cultures, and that my own culture is a mosaic of contributions from many cultures that I didn't even think much about since there are more than I was exposed to growing up.  This is part of why I had my daughter's Girl Scout troop learn about a different country and its cultures every month...just last year.  And they're repeating it this year.  So, in 2017 and 2018, something I learned from this show is impacting kindergarteners through fourth graders today.",0,0,2018-09-30T02:40:18.000Z,Alys Marchand,UCujN5QALEiBOdrNJ0lcaHhg,vQfYtmkpczU,True,UgwhE2SoCBi5YAWernt4AaABAg
