"So you're basically telling me, with that last part of the video, that I should trust somebody to put a cryptominer on my computer and trust them to let it run mining, on my electricity bill and wearing down my hardware, so that it's technically free? At that point I'm actually just paying for that game in new hardware and electricity that's a LOT more expensive than just paying for a game because that literally does not have a cap. If I'm JUST using an RX 580 to mine with it will cost me 10$ a month to run that, most games don't cost much more than double that.

On top of that you're basically giving the keys to your computer to somebody who has every single monetary incentive to mine as much and as hard as possible on your computer whenever they can because it's on my electricity bill and wearing down my hardware. It's basically a nice scheme for them to kill my CPU and GPU fans and for a lot of people that means killing their GPU, voiding the warranty on it, all while somebody else is making money on it. Again they have every incentive in the world to start pumping out cheap asset flips with this scheme with sock puppet ""publishers"" because now they've basically got a virus that is printing them money off of other people's hardware and electricity.

On TOP of all these things, it's a 2d game with always online DRM(you HAVE to be connected to the internet for mining to work) that degrades the performance on my computer, and I can only run one of them at a time.

"I don't think blockchain is necessary (or efficient) for any of those ideas except maybe the final one, which is very interesting, I rather like it... I did like the idea someone else had for this being useful in a system where you could take items from co-operating game to game and use them and the devs of each game would know the item is legit without needing access to the servers or info of the other dev, but there's loads of other easier ways to do this (like key pairs, etc). Plus, how often do you play 2 competing games which are so similar that the items from one would be useful in another? Something you might do with blockchain though is a distributed multiplayer server world itself... there are lots of games out there where you can play with a large group (like 20-200 players) but there are thousands of different player groups and each of them has taken the universe in a different direction. No Man's Sky comes to mind. Maybe blockchain's distributed power could help players to retain game events or ""history"" of their shared world (permanent changes to the landscape, NPCs, etc from the base game) which they could just send to new players who have vanilla software; the difference from the way we'd do that now is that the if the company decided to stop running the servers, people would not lose the game world in which they invested all that effort and time... I dunno. The only benefit blockchain would bring would be that you'd know if someone tampered with it, but do you really care in that context? Also the files would become ridiculously huge.

"You dont even need to use blockchain for that, and its bad design idea to even implement it in blockchain. Every time you need to update the history of the sword you need to pay some Eth, why not just use DB and it can do the same thing without paying $X.XX just to add more data to the block chain.
Blockchain isnt free, and its actually more expensive to register data in block chain then putting data in a cheap MySQL server, and blockchain is slow as hell, blockchain = slow old pc (why would you store data that takes 30secs up to 30 mins to insert and validate a data). Its not suitable for MMO obviously, as MMO thrives on real-time data put/get.
Some people says it is resistant to meddling of the data, if you want it to be at that level, means the chain need to be at a very high difficulty, and lots of computing power mining the chain. Which equates to more $$Dosh to put data to the chain.
Honestly you need to rethink what blockchain really is, and how does it works. Then maybe you can figure out how to implement blockchain in game.

"This might never be read of anybody, but I'll still try it. This is a very interesting episode. But it doesn't really catches the real concept (the idea) of what a blockchain is for. Blockchain is a system for people who don't need or want to trust each other or don't want a higher institution who take care of them. In gaming a game company an its server software is such an institution. In a blockchain supported system it's very hard, if not impossible, to fool somebody because you have to fool or manipulate everybody and everything: the whole chain. This is the true power (and weakness) of blockchains, it's a design to create a decentralized, self regulatory system without the need to trust, without need to have a higher entity which watches that everything is alright. Your example with items which gain experience over time is awesome, but it doesn't need a blockchain to work, it could also work with a normal data table, without encrypted chains.",0,0,2018-06-22T15:23:03.000Z

Having regular weapons which were used during alpha- and beta-testing, after a time become weapons of legacy (I know, my D&D is showing) as the game matures is a really cool concept which would really flesh out the world without having to go into Dark Souls-esque levels of item creation (just finished watching the ""Content Conundrum"" episode, :P )

"That's a well researched video and I agree to all the points mentioned in it. However, I would like to point out some things. 
1) Even though Cryptokitties can not be said as a true game, but it was the first blockchain based project which allowed players to collect, breed, sell their Cryptokitties. The DNA concept is very complex in Cryptokitties and that also made it stand out. It's the reason it attracted players not only from blockchain world but also mainstream gaming. Also the fact that these kitties are truly owned by the players, there have been games based on Cryptokitties, say like a kitty racing game, which allows players to use their kitties in these games. But yes, the concept is now old and there are literally hundreds of game which have just copied the same concept and none of them will survive for too long.
2) Your idea of achievements recorded on items is actually a brilliant idea. And some blockchain games are already working on it. These games have come out of the collectible era and making games which will compete with mainstream games. Blockchain will be to improve things like true ownership of assets, direct trading between players and most importantly rare will be rare. The game can't just print more rare items of a kind at their own will. 

I will request you to look into blockchain games like Hash Rush. Their alpha registrations are open. You will see how much evolution has occurred in these past few months. You can watch this pre-alpha video to understand what I want to say. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE26UFTh0ok&t

No vendor lock-in with systems like Steam or Origin that force you to go through their client every time you want to download or launch a game, and no restrictions like ""you can't sell a used copy of the game to someone else; it's permanently locked to your account"".

Sadly, there's no incentive for game companies to adopt this while they can still get away with selling people non transferable copies of games that they can arbitrarily revoke at any time. The status quo is already strictly superior from their perspective.",0,0,2018-06-14T01:43:39.000Z

"I've been thinking about this for a week now. Unfortunately I have to say that the conclusions reached in this episode are missing the point of the underlying philosophy and technology of distributed encryption systems. As it says in the episode itself: The point of such technologies is that we don't have to trust centralized information authentication. (Whether that's a good thing, overkill or just not doable at all is more of a techno-philosophical problem.)
The thing with the systems described here is: It is still completely central. We're talking about online games. Which have servers. Which belong to and are operated by a company.
What additional use is it to move tracking and verification of ownership and/or the history and development of things to a distributed cryptographic system when there is only one central position to verify and act on that information? Not much. And with that it would be just buzzwording and bloating the tech.
Operators can track and hold this information in their database much easier. In fact there are technologies in modern databases that lend themselves quite nicely to that.
Unless, that is, suddenly there were to appear games which grant you _personal ownership_ of, say, items you aquire in game. In that case it would start to get a bit tricky to trust a centralized information storage in general! But (big one) that will not happen soon due to the many legal and organizational pitfalls this brings with it.
In conclusion: Although this episodes again presents many fine ideas and information it seems to me that the underlying principles of distributed and encrypted data storage and verification have not been thought through in their application to the scenarios you present.

"............... You know, that game feature you just described rings one particular reference bell VERY loudly for me. Noble Phantasm. For those of you not familiar with Fate: Stay Night and its MANY relatives in the same universe, a Noble Phantasm is an item (or more rarely, concept) so famous that that fact alone confers unto it abilities based off of that legend, even when the original item didn't actually possess those abilities. An example of something that DID have original abilities would be Excalibur. An example of something that didn't would likely be Jack the Ripper's knives. An example of something that's more conceptual than physical is the Twelve Labours of Hercules, which basically not only made him MUCH harder to kill, but required you to kill him 12 separate times for it to stick (especially insane attacks could manage multiple kills at once, but that's not exactly common, especially with him gaining resistance to the same attack the more kills it manages). I have not a single clue how a game implementing such a system would work (since every individual item would require its own space until completely destroyed, and would be cross-referenced almost constantly if the 'previous owners' actions impact their old gear' thing applied, thus requiring MASSIVE amounts of computational power), but I would love to see it attempted.",0,0,2018-06-06T04:28:04.000Z

"All that was said from a game design perspective sounds really cool, I'd want that in my games.

But it doesn't really need blockchain to be implemented, let's get serious here. Something as simple as p2p for sharing information that is not mission critical (like progression history of an item which is only needed for flavour and immersion) could have been used 10-15 years ago to reduce costs for maintaining servers while maintaining rich content. It would have allowed the developers to maintain the original hashes of the data, making sure that everybody is sharing only genuine data and nothing else that could compromise an end-users machine. However, developers stayed away from it in order to avoid the legal hassle of networking their users'  PCs. Blockchain might be even more secure and removes the game's servers as a required central hub (which matters if people want to keep playing after the development company decides to stop maintaining the game's servers). However, blockchain is also more taxing on the end-user's hardware, so I'm not really sure that the equation changes all that much. When I'm playing, I don't want my rig to be slowed down by tasks that are not essential. And when I""m not using a particular app, I don't expect any of its tasks or services to be active on my machine because I may be using another app and we return to the previous point. Period. When exactly do I share the information with other nodes (only when levels are loading?)... it's a bit iffy...

"Nice vids. Although I think you can do most of the ideas mentioned in this video without using blockchain.
For me, one of the greatest value of ""blockchain"" technology is in its *decentralized* nature, whether in versioning tool like Git or Crypto-currency. But since in MMO game you will usually want to have centralized server (due to copyright issue), there's no need to create complex mechanism related to blockchain (hash key, backup, branching, etc) that will tax your own system and potentially create future problem (in case of branching).

One case I might see how blockchain could be used is exactly counter to my previous point: Creating a game that allow people to host it on their server (thus multiple independent, but collective system) and transfer data across those multiple servers using blockchain. In this case, the game will be less vulnerable to hacking, but there will be substantial overhead on data transfer as the server will also need to communicate between themselves as much as between them and their clients (players).",0,0,2018-06-05T03:55:46.000Z

"I think there is a huge problem with the hypothetical MMO example. The whole purpose of blockchain is to store data in a decentralized way with a resistance to modification. Without mentioning either of these aspects, the MMO example seems to have a loose creative inspiration from the algorithm that makes blockchain work. However, this idea that he came up with could easily be implemented without knowing anything about blockchain or even using blockchain at all. In fact, it was almost like he was implying that blockchain wouldn't be used in his blockchain mmo example. I also assume that even if you did use blockchain, it would probably use way too much storage assuming that the MMO has many types of items and each player has lots of items.

Now I honestly wonder if there is a way to incorporate blockchain in creating a video game. I don't know enough about how blockchain works to know what types of games you can make with minimal use of a centralized server. Can you make MMOs? fighting games? I wouldn't be surprised if it is extremely impractical, but I'm curious.

Also as a sidenote, I may not be a fan of MMOs, but I'm pretty sure that if my weapon that I bought from someone else on an auction suddenly turned into an end game weapon, it would just feel random and frustrating.",0,0,2018-06-04T23:53:17.000Z

It's cool that you've got a new host, and it's great that he'll have his own ~natural~ style of delivery. But you've now gotten rid of much of the EC aesthetic simultaneous with that change, and that's incredibly jarring. That really wasn't something which needed to be specific to Dan. Why did that need to change at all?

"A similar technology that I think would be beneficial to multiplayer games is IPFS (interplanetary file system). It allows files to be distributed (similar to torrenting) which can enable redundancy and low latency by finding hosts near you. Another advantage is scalability. For traditional multiplayer games, as they become more popular the company has to invest in more infrastructure to host the game. This becomes expensive and contributes to games being shut down when they are no longer popular enough to justify the infra expenses (though there are other expenses).  It would be cool if using IPFS you could make each player a node in the file system and have them host a duplicate of the game’s DB (or a slice of it) which other players could access if they don’t have a copy.  Then as a game becomes more popular, you gain more nodes to help spread the load, the same occurs when the game becomes less popular. The game dev could always “subsidize” the system with their own hosted copies to ensure there are no times where no-one is online with a copy of a file you need.

It’s possible that this wouldn’t work well for a game with a high frequency of updates (like an FPS) but might work well for turn based games or for apps in general. When originally thinking about this I thought it’d be great for a chat app like Slack where historical messages are backed up by the network (with some encryption), instead of a central server.

"A few things you got wrong about crypto kitties;

@4:00 the creators of crypto kitties don't controller the exchange for it . And it isn't the only exchange.

 Anyone can make a exchange smart contract with or without fees. And the only thing the creators can do with the exchange contract is pausing it.

@3:00 The programer who receives the fee doesn't just call a function he also pay big transaction fee to execute the breeding function that calculates the new genes. And anyone can be a programmer to collect this fee by calling the function. So this is not income for the creators. 

Why do users call this fee? Because currently smart contracts can't execute on a delay. (In this case when pregnancy is over). So instead someone else has to call the function. And yes it literally is a bunch of programmers running around calling the function. Competing to be first at the lowest gas cost.

Ps yes cryptokitties is limited and I'm excited for more complex games to adopt block chain. But right now the example given would cost the user a little of money to play. Every action cost money and cryptokitties already cost 1$ per action and 6$ for breading. So keeping track of a sword like that would cost a lot. 

But there are solutions on its way like state channels with raiden, sidechaining, plasma and possibly sharding in the far future. So who knows what the future will look like!",0,0,2018-06-02T19:12:40.000Z

A - It doesn't make a game ""truly free to play"" as you say; the cost just turns up on your electric bill.

B - Cryptocurrencies infamously get more and more expensive to mine with every unit that's already been mined, so therefore the only way the game's revenue would go up or remain steady on a month-to-month basis is if the player-base continues to grow at an increasing rate *forever*, which is, y'know, IMPOSSIBLE.

C - Cryptocurrency mining is already destroying the environment with the absolutely ridiculous amount of energy it wastes. The last thing humanity needs is for more of the game industry to needlessly contribute to that destruction.

"But why exactly a blockchain? If you want verifiable transactions the answer are signatures.
If you don't want a central storage server, the answer is a peer-to-peer storage solution (there are dozens)
If you want a history, well, just save it.

A blockchain has serious disadvantages:

doesn't natively scale good.
very rugged system. not that easy to change.
limited to no control over the data (you might need to have control for legal reasons)
51% percent attack very possible for a small network
If embedded into bigger network (mitigate 51% percent attack) you have running costs in that currency.

And don't say 'that is right now, think about THE FUTURE'. Yeah. I heard that. If you have a better idea than a block chain, it's not a block chain anymore...

"Welcome Matt! A really interesting topic to start with and I enjoyed the video. I love any system that allows us to tell stories in new ways, which your block chain loot system seems to do. I think something you neglected in the episode is the social aspect that this loot system might have. If I see that Player X was a server first to clear Black Rock Mountain, I know that they are the shit. I might wanna join the guild they're in, I might try and find them and add them to my friends list. This could even help tell fun PvP stories. If you know someone from the enemy faction is ganking a bunch of your guild mates, you might steer clear of someone who has a weapon previously owned by that player. Alternatively, it might put you into a fit of rage. 

I think a game which allowed for loot to be taken from an enemy player and be worn like a trophy would really benefit from a system you describe. I wonder if block chain could maybe help with world building, changing the Living World Seasons of GW2 into actual moments of history for the world/server. People talk about lining up for Naxxramas or other huge moments in WoW and those are told orally, but what if the world could tell those stories innately?

"I don't believe that incorporating a blockchain into an MMO would allow you to accomplish anything that you can't accomplish with a regular database. As far as I see it, using a blockchain to keep track of a player's inventory has the following advantages:
 - It's more decentralized. Even if the company who made the game shuts down its item server, you would still be able to access your items (this more applies to games like TF2 and CS:GO because they allow you to host your own game server, but not your own item server).
 - Less infrastructure/backups would be required because every user of the blockchain could help host it.
It would also have the following disadvantages:
 - A copy of the entire blockchain would have to be obtained by any node before it could be used. This could result in longer loading times when first installing the game/running the game for a first time in a while (you could probably use a more traditional style item server as a backup to mitigate this).
 - Blockchains never forget useless data, causing them to grow faster than a normal database would. If an item is deleted, for example, all of its transaction history would remain in the blockchain, even if that data never gets used (a special new type of blockchain could probably be created that does not do this).",0,0,2018-06-01T18:30:55.000Z

"I am seeing a lot of mixed ideas here on Matt's performance. I've read ""be yourself"" ""be yourself but be more like Dan for NOW"" and even comments about how he may sound insecure, when in fact  Matt could already BE being as himself. You wouldn't know that though because you have seen one video of him. Just overall VERY critical comments. Everyone talks about how gentle Dan's voice was and are comparing the two.Matt will NEVER be Dan. As a long time fan, I will say it was hard to hear Dan leaving and a bit scary. I didn't want my fear and attachment to Dan to mess up my experience learning about Matt.I admit, I took an extra day to just click on the new video in fear it would be Matt. (lol) But, it is not just Matt's job to pull us in, but for us, as an Extra Community,to have an open mind and heart to him too. We all want to see this channel succeed and we do that through showing support. Not just giving advice and giving our demands. One person said they would give Matt 3 videos to get it together. Really? When most of us have been around since the very beginning, that is a harsh statement and too much pressure, but Matt is the one who has to chill out? 

Critique is okay, and more so when you have suggestions on how to get better, but I am sure the way most of us are critiquing isn't the humble way Dan would want us to welcome a new narrator. Its fine being honest, but it becomes a problem when that is mixed with harsh words along with imposed ideas on how Matt SHOULD BE. We got paragraphs of negative feedback and one sentence of "" we welcome you to the channel!"" how can that possibly be when we are already throwing advice on how he should do his videos? We all need to take a big bite of Humble pie and realize we too, as fans, have to let go and chillax ourselves instead of Matt. Maybe you are not as excited as he is to be part of this fantastic channel that has given us SO MUCH of their hard work and time.Maybe that excitement is coming through disingenuous because you dont have buy in yet with Matt. THAT IS OKAY. It will take time for us to get use to the new videos.

Extra credits has given us YEARS of their time. They deserve us WELCOMING Matt with open arms and getting to know HIM.  I do not think I have ever commented on these videos before. But as part of the video game community and the Extra credit Community, we need to do better at showing our gratitude. They could have just canceled this series all together. Barely anyone has acknowledge or said thank you to Extra credits for all the hard work and dedication and leap they had to make and I am sure they knew it would be a big difference to us. in turn probably hoped we would have a more warm heart welcome. 

Thank you Matt for taking this on. Thank you to the artist for keeping this going and to the entire team for all your hard work in providing us with good quality content.

"I’m going to possibly embarrass myself due to my complete lack of knowledge about block chains but I have an idea. 

Stemming off the notion of tracking entities, what if they instead tracked players by their characters up until its death? A player can have an account which they can make up to 1-3 characters at any time which are a type unique being but like xcom once they’re dead they’re gone.

Then from the performance and interactions that character had the player would be judged. So you could end up with players with a history like “X once the apprentice of John ‘doom fist’ Gib [or who ever took them through a tutorial] fought in (event) with (player) and eventually...... etc etc”

"I understand that the ""sword"" example is just that, an example, but i could not help but see a few problems with it that would need to be adressed.

Sure, having such a system would be nice, but lets consider the following:

Balance, all of the sudden you have multiple weapons that have different types of stats depending on who wield it before hand, they would have to be sold or aquired apropriately for their respective stats

Having one of those swords and having it level up due to a future deed could also affect the progress of the player who is currently using it.

You could make it so that these weapons only progress in a particular way, and in doing so are then bound to a rarity of sorts to then be sold/bought later on, but that would make it no different than buying weapons relevant to your level in any MMO, it would just change distribution.

Dependin on how the weapons are passed by, on a regular MMo you would just create a character, farm a weapon, leave it behind, delete char, get same weapon but buffed.

Or in a non MMO it would affect players experiences with the games in a huge way. 

Think i would need a better example for this, i just took it as being more trouble than it is worth knowing that now somewhere my first weapon in the game belongs to the 30th person who is having a way easier time defeating the 7th boss of the game because i cleared the game and now that sword is ""Azure's 30+ People Sword of Endgameclearing""",0,0,2018-06-01T13:23:44.000Z

"Is Blockchain the right tool for your example?

You are describing ""Event Sourcing"" as Martin Fowler defines it: It describes a technique on using a ledger to essentially write down everything that ever happens in a Program/Game/etc. 

Of course this only works if you can trust whoever runs the application-server (in this case the MMO) not to tamper with this ledger and that no invalid data is inserted into the ledger.

In my opinion there is no reason why you shouldn't trust the server.

But let's imagine we can't trust the server. What is there not to trust: The developers not tampering with the ledger. There are two ways for tampering with the ledger:
a) You tamper with it as data comes in.
b) You tamper with it after it has been inserted into the ledger.

There are good reasons why a game-company might to to both:
Scenario a) Anti-Cheat. If a game-company detects cheats, it might change the data submitted by the client as to arrive to a valid game state.
Scenario b) GDPR. Let's imagine you want to release your game in the EU. And the username is stored in the ledger. Now a user calls himself ""FirstName.SurName"". Now EU-Regulations force you to delete this record if the user wishes it or get possibly fined.

Using Block-Chain implementing Scenario A is feasible but not without significant delay (with BitCoins the delay is afaik around 80 Minutes until a payment can be confirmed). Using Block-Chain implementing Scenario B is utterly impossible by design.

To illustrate this argument further:
Owning a copy of the Bitcoin block-chain is forbidden in Germany (and I imagine a lot of other countries) on the basis that the Child Porn people inserted into the block-chain cannot be deleted and owning a copy of Child Porn in any way, shape or form will land you a prison sentence.

To wrap this up:
Using Block-Chains in games are a horrible idea.",0,0,2018-06-01T10:02:57.000Z

But imagine a game just like the one you described with that awesome sword, but the items also get stronger as they're used, And imagine instead of picking sword style, bow style etc at the start you make your own weapon from parts that don't even have to make sense together. You go out with a one of a kind nun-bow-axe-apult and kill some goblins with it and make it stronger. You kill a boss with it, (another feature I dream of is for that to be a significant feat and the boss never respawn. he is dead now for the rest of that server's life although a different boss may take over his dungeon later) and it gains special properties from the event and becomes a truly one of a kind item.

Although I do enjoy the other subjects produced by EC, and they are important, the flagship subject of games and how it affects the world seem to be fading away with videos becoming more and more infrequent.  I get there is only a finite number of game related subjects to cover, but its now easy for gaming videos to get drowned out by everything else.  Like remembering music videos on MTV, I fear there'll be a time in the future when I look back on EC and when it started and think, ""Yep, that's 'when games mattered'"".",10,6,2018-06-01T04:49:28.000Z

"... OK. matt, look im sorry to have to ask this of you. i mean, its HARD to ask it. but im going to point out something. over the years, theres been a lot of youtube shows. EC being one of them, as well as one called sourcefed nerd. now a long time ago there were several hosts of SFN. they had a number of shows. some were awesome. some not so much. but the binding thing was, we were watching to support our favorite hosts and content. *mostly news.* then out of the blue, the company that have bought source fed nerd, basicly cleared the slate, letting go of the entire staff. there were a lot of heart felt goodbyes. and boom, they immediately started posting new stuff under the name of NOW THIS NERD.  they made 3 episodes, reassuring us they were going to do the exact same thing that source fed nerd had done. and it would be awesome. HOWEVER... yeah this is were the story turns.

the amount of hate, the spite the show received, was over whelming. the name change, the staff change, the assumption they were welcome to the rest of us in one shot. it was massive. the channel went dark fast. it had to...it was like introducing a band that was not even on the ticket for the show you came to see, being lead offstage by armed tigers. people DO NOT TAKE WELL TO CHANGE. shortly after i posted to them a message of my own, they changed the channels name BACK to source fed nerd, apologized, and left a link to their new show. but never once did we get an answer to our question ""if your planning to do the same stuff, why didnt you just keep sourcefed nerd running?""  

so is now this nerd still going. I nither know, nor do i care. (my last message to them was the very mean ""why are you still here!"") 
we get used to the people who do our shows and we like them. and i gotta tell ya, its kinda a rough start, to be thrown into an episode right out of the gates like that. now I LOVE extra credits, been following it for years. but you must address the elephant in the room. dans departure, why is it happening? every time we had a guest artist on this show we have welcomed them with open arms. and fondly we remember all who came before. and maybe EC is actually james and all his mad writing skills. who knows. but what matters to us. is that everything is ok. so by next episode, you need to address this. they why's and the whens. is dan going to be back? has there been a falling out? do we need to look at upper management and have them removed. (it happened to sourcefed. the internet does not forgive nor forget.) this is a small team, and we love what they do. but we are invested in them. so if your going to fill that podium, you best step into with a lot more grace. 

ya sound nice matt. we kinda want to hear more.",0,0,2018-06-01T04:28:43.000Z

"ok im sorry  but im going to call out this after my other comment form over  a second ago ... this sounds fascinating but the way mister not dan (sorry legit can't remember your name )  im my eyes only seems to make the gaming landscape worce  true scarcity isn't a problem  it's the people who use it ... i'm one of the few people who will still play evony clones for the fun of building a city and empire until it is immediately stamped on by some jackass 12 ranks higher because he needs 50,000 more what evers so he can keep war with what's his face  going  case he said something he didn't like about  some other some such

what about the players who would then monopolize the system to crank out  weapons and tools with the same traits and thus the only way to meet  the requirements to go thru raids would be to buy the gear ""this massively overpriced iron sword that we made so we can charge this one guy we don't like  50000 gold for  a crappy knife"" (+1 to some such stat) in blue ink rather then white

what about people who sell off these out grown weapons  to give them to other players to trade them back and forth  to grow and keep power rather then just play the game  

or worse yet  have some way of tracking  these things so they can kill other players to take back that one thing over and over again thus adjusting its leave ach time so that no new weapon the devs make can compeat  and the  the controle of the whole game gos to this one player giuld rather then the game deves its self 

say what you will this can happen  and if i know pepole who play games on line ... wich i do adly.... it will if thay can make it 

all this to make a point about we should find way to make games more  safe  for  people on the receiving  end  making harassment   go away  and insuring that games are fair and fun  first then tackle the idea that the character  i made one off on eso  could make crafts he wasn't  capable of using (couldn't even give them away sadly i tried you don't want to know what kind of response i got)  and then add to that the effect that this op gear he made could then be used to control and kill the game itself",0,0,2018-06-01T01:43:36.000Z

"The decentralized aspect of blockchain actually makes me wonder if it's usable enough as a non-online form of DRM, that maybe grants players more means of using their games than they normally would. The big problem with the initial Xbox One concept was that players didn't want to be tied to online services - but, on some levels, Microsoft's initial idea of unbinding games from discs and letting you use them in other ways had some cool aspects to it. Imagine, for instance, if you could hold your collection of games on a specialized thumb drive that acts something like a crypto wallet, and then visiting your friend out in the sticks still lets you play that game there. Or, when finished with a particular game, you can transfer it directly to a friend's thumb drive, or buy a new one to put it onto for easier sharing.

Sadly, I don't know who, if anyone, would even have monetary interest in such a system.",0,0,2018-05-31T22:28:48.000Z

"this kinda reminds me of the game mechanics in the PS1 & 2 game series, Dark Cloud. It was a cool mechanic in which weapons evolved as you used them and modified them. This seems like a creative way of creating a community cultivated heirlooms and artifacts. Such a mechanic would do well in say Ever Quest, Guildwars, or even Fable should the games continue in new releases or grow in ways that these mechanic would be available considering so many aspects are choice based with character development impacts. Why not have weapons & gear do the same?

"if i got a sword that keep evolving like that in the example, i think i just keep using it and make it stronger, keep using it for the event and just keep adding more name on the weapon and stat boost on it just to make it as OP as i can, so using block chain like that can be abuse and making the crafting system kind of irrelevant, so in my perspective, Blockchain can be abuse and end up having lot and lot of player having OP weapon that got some similar or different stat, and it could be a problem that the fist player see his weapon again and see how OP it is compare to his current weapon, and essentially, can cause the other player to get bully as the other guy want his weapon back under the pretext he was the fist player to own it and so it his ""rightfully"" his weapon, and that can potentially can cause to become a Toxic element in the game, personally, i prefer to craft my weapon and armor so i can give the stat i want on it, like the Zaw weapon in Warframe, (it basically a customizable melee weapon), you can give it the base stat that you want, and when it reach level 30, you get the option to ""gild"" it, increasing the stat, and if you still like it, you can place a Arcane on it to make it better, and the Arcane is upgradable too, and plus you can share the build that you made to other friend and they can chose to have the same build on it, or modified the build to there own need, so like that, it eliminate the possibility to have people to get jealous of you weapon since they can just ask how they did it to get the weapon to have those specific stat, and resulting in a much more nicer community were everyone can have there own stuff at the end",0,0,2018-05-31T22:21:09.000Z

"FREE TO MINE IS A TERRIBLE IDEA - Here’s why.

The largest audience for free to play games are kids and most use their parents computers. 

Mining crypto often comes directly out of your electricity bill so the game is simply being paid for in a different way, not free. 

Intensive mining can kill a GPU or even brick a computer in less than a month- especially with old hardware. 

There’s no way to preemptively gauge the lifespan of your hardware remotely since failures can only be detected after the fact. 

$200-500 GPU’s are significantly more expensive than a $60 game and it’s unlikely non-tech savvy parents or even kids would realize what they are doing to their computer unless a VERY clear warning and agreement are given to you first.

Now; I imagine the idea is only to use a fraction of the computer power, otherwise the game itself would perform horribly but my point is that the cost is simply coming from somewhere else and if we give permission to companies to use our hardware for mining then nothing is preventing them from ramping up power draw or usage. 

Or even worse, they start doing it without permission and we have no legal recourse. 

The only benefit to this is that you aren’t paying for a game up front- which is great for kids but apart from them and the company profiting, this would be terrible for the PC owner and home owner.",2,0,2018-05-31T21:34:25.000Z

What is the reason that you couldn't track the exact same object leveling system in a relational database?,0,0,2018-05-31T18:57:15.000Z
"There is an inherent problem with the example that you posed in the video: the mechanic in which an item gains more stats as it is passed from hand to hand is doable with a simple centralized server and it's surely more efficient than doing it with blockchain. Remember the main reason why blockchain was born: it was the framework of a decentralized ledger with no authority that could , as a single entity, modify its contents. There is absolutely no need for a decentralized network in a game: by design a game has a group of developers to which the players give their trust as soon as they start playing the game. We don't need something to make it decentralized and authority-less because we can trust the developers to do the right thing!
Also implementing blockchain means that nodes should hold the entirety of the blockchain for as long as the game lives, but it starts to become less and less manageable as time goes on and the size of the ledger increases: at a certain point you'll find that the ledger may become even heavier on your hard drive than the game itself. This could be done with much less effort with a single centralized server of the devs choosing.

Unfortunately this is a great problem with everyone that tries to develop things around the blockchain: you need to understand that this kind of technology is not just a ledger,  because a centralized server can do the exact same work more efficiently, it's main strength it's that it can be trusted even with no authority, which means that there are basically zero reasons to use the blockchain in a videogame, where the devs can be a trusted authority.",0,0,2018-05-31T18:57:10.000Z

"I'm sorry but I couldn't finish the video, I couldn't get into it, I couldn't follow along.
Here is the constructive criticism, you need to tone it down a lot, you are too intense, you sound like one of those shopping channel adverts. Too loud and too shouty, it grates and makes it so that you can't relax into the video, the best part of these videos were that you could just relax and let it flow over you, you could almost fall asleep to them (but they are so good and interesting you don't), this allowed the information to sink in.

I get that you are enthusiastic, but scale it back, chill out and relax, that allows the passion and intensity to pop when it is called for, but without the contrast, it just leaves you constantly on edge.

This is actually the same issue that Chris Evans had when he hosted Top Gear and the same complaint that was leveled at him, people liked Matt Leblanc's style and thought he should be the main host and that Evans should tone it down,  he didn't and in the end he left the show.

You're not Dan, and we get that, and you shouldn't try to be Dan, but at the same time, you shouldn't try to be a radical departure from what was there before.",46,0,2018-05-31T18:03:42.000Z

"I could see it being used to decentralize the game a bit so less stress is put on the server, good for companies with less money to throw at infrastructure. game progress for players and items could be saved in the blockchain, and then a decentralized node-like system could run the server logic itself, also with a blockchain-like system where the various machines would check each others' work and make sure that none of them are giving manipulated outputs.
having a player seamlessly move from one machine-cluster to another depending on their physical location in the game world would also be a good touch, and maybe even dynamically split up the world into larger or smaller slices in a given location depending on the relative player densities",0,0,2018-05-31T17:39:04.000Z

"Going to miss Dan but welcome Matt. Also I love this ideal for so many reasons. Its just so cool and I'd love to see how this plays out.  The only real issues I can see right off the bat are if players just went out and bought low level gear and equipped it all before a raid boss like in the heirloom system you mentioned. While super cool on paper, some players could buy dozens of low level swords equip them once and then later sell on. Although that could simply be solved by having the weapon need a necessary playtime or just scale the buff with the playtime to make the most used one the best by far.",0,0,2018-05-31T16:46:01.000Z

"Sounds to me like leveling up a weapon like that would just powercreep your early game to hell.  You did that example with 1 weapon.  If 2 million players leveled up their weapon, then passed it down to an alt or a new player, then all you have now is starting gear that has more stats then it did at the start.  Because there are hundreds of thousands of players who kill grilmig, there's no scarcity at all there, meaning any trade price would be low.  That puts it in reach of new players, who now have a weapon that trivializes the early game.  Over a couple years of an MMO running, you'd eventually just get a weapon at level 2 that will one shot everything before level 70.",0,0,2018-05-31T16:11:51.000Z

"Kinda short, and I suggested the second option to some programmers, but they weren't interested, because that seemingly wasn't profitable, with existing cryptocurrencies. And I like the thought of weapons growing slower than characters, but still growing. I would personally think of placing a bigger in-game currency fee for selling it, like by requiring the services of an NPC (like it being a soulbound item that can be unbound), and have it constantly drain XP from the players (to keep players from hoarding such items).",3,1,2018-05-31T15:08:27.000Z

"The MMO weapon example is something that you can already do without Block Chain. Honestly, it shouldn't even be that hard. You'd just need to slightly alter your enchantment system and not have an issue with having every item be unique (which is generally a bad idea as I understand it). Or does Block Chain somehow solve the issues caused by having too many permanent, unique items for the computer to think about at the same time?

A more interesting use of Block Chain would be in TCG's. If the pack of cards you open on MagicTheGathering.com had the kind of permanence and ownership rights that Bitcoin does, and could be traded just as easily as ordinary cards, without the need to go through Hasbro, then that would be a pretty big step forward in terms of them being true collectibles. Honestly, it would be good for any collectible, which would make it a natural for pairing with loot boxes. 

Though, what the legal distinction is between collectibles that makes one a harmless TCG/sports card, rather than a vicious, predatory gambling mechanic is a bit beyond me. Honestly, they've both always felt like gambling to me. I just prefer TCG's because, when you finally get tired of flushing your money down the drain, you can get some of it back by selling your collection.

It might also be interesting in something like Eve Online. Just imagine if you legally owned your fleet in the same way that you own a car, rather than the much murkier (legally speaking) way that you own it now. Though, why a game developer would want to allow that kind of ownership is another question entirely. After all, when you eventually have to ban someone, or worse, shut down your game, you're definitely going to get sued if you don't provide people with some method of keeping their ships even without access to the game.

Also, I like the ""mining in the background"" idea, but it's unlikely that it would be implemented in a player-centric manner. It would almost certainly be implemented in a way that would cripple any machine it was run on (possibly even when the game wasn't being played) and act more like a virus than a game. After all, why settle for only using resources that the player wasn't using and only while the game was being played when you can burn out their entire machine and get ten times as much mining done? Any argument against this would be concerned with long term consequences and player rights, which are hardly likely to be high on the priority lists of the companies most likely to try this. And even if only a small percentage of game makers did it this way, after a few bad experiences and/or negative stories in the press, all games of this type would be assumed to do it and would be avoided like the plague. Heck, anti-virus software would likely just start tagging the games as viruses by default.

On a side note, I'd disagree about the cat game not being a game. There are plenty of games out there about breeding animals, and people that do it for real as a hobby certainly enjoy it. Even if its implementation leaves much to be desired, it doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with the idea itself. For example, if Square made a new chocobo breeding game that used this technology, I think it might be quite popular.",0,0,2018-05-31T15:03:00.000Z

"I never heard of this ""blockchain"" concept before, which is interesting only after you explained a potential use of it in the later half of the video. You didn't really explain what blockchain is, but I guess anyone can look up what it mean anyway.

However, the idea of players spending money on in-game gear used and upgraded by a former player could be an issue unless the game itself and all gameplay content like DLC, is actually free. Still, it would leave players open to potential hacks and/or lack of ownership for an in-game item due to power outages or disconnections.

So this system you explain may have to be exclusive to consoles given the higher security measures in place for online. But if the game were offline only, the idea of making a weapon stronger and more unique through use of various scenarios is pretty awesome.",0,0,2018-05-31T13:38:11.000Z

"There's some problems with the idea of using blockchain in games. Using your example, the ""loot table blockchain"" would quickly become bloated and cumbersome, unless you purposefully limit the number of available weapons in the world relative to the number of players to avoid requiring the running of nodes to store the sheer number of weapons. To put it another way, new players are going to buy new weapons unless these used weapons with stat boosts are cheaper, thus bloating the blockchain with unused items. This creates another problem where, if the used weapons with stat boosts are cheaper only because the cost of new weapons goes up with the number of weapons in the world, you'll eventually have a scenario where new players can't afford to get any weapons because the cost of new weapons is up and all of the used weapons with statboosts have been massively boosted retroactively by their previous owner's deeds driving their costs up as well. And if the costs of weapons aren't driven up the world experience either power creep or a flood of unused weapons that have to be stored in the blockchain.

I'm sure there's ways to use the blockchain in games, probably with trading card games like Hearthstone, but I'll be real with you when I say I don't think any sort of RPG equipment is the place for it if you don't want to spend an inordinate amount of time and/or money working around the inherent problems of such a system.",0,0,2018-05-31T13:30:11.000Z

As per the ""have your game run a data miner in the background""... there have already been products that have tried that.

Though... people did still use Kazaa in really high amounts...

The ""having your stuff in games have a history to them""... eh.. that is something that is usually better done in other ways.

"Blockchains are simply a way of storing data. What a blockchain allows you is to give access to a database where nobody trusts anyone.

If we have to trust the game company to correctly implement the game on the basis of a blockchain, we could use a traditional database anyways. This is the point: Blockchains are a solution for a very, very fringe problem. And this problem has nothing to do with gamedesign, or videogames as a whole.

To elaborate further, the idea that an item collects traits as it continues to exist is /already possible/ using traditional databases. The big downside of the blockchain is that, to actually have ANY advantage from using a blockchain in comparison to a traditional database, every player needs to have a copy of the blockchain.

So imagine when you start your favourite MMO, you suddenly need to download terrabytes of data for every existing transaction. Every gold coin that has ever been spent, every mob that has ever been killed, every item that has ever dropped, been used or sold - all of it lands on your harddrive. That is NOT feasable in ANY way",0,0,2018-05-31T12:38:41.000Z

"Upshift your voice and you can stay :D
For real though, the ""Storied Sword"" idea is fantastic, but I agree with the comments that it'd probably be more effective to localize that to a server. Or, as an alternative, you could localize it entirely for offline play. Say, if you're running a roguelike, you use a sword to beat a boss? That becomes a storied weapon you could find in your next run. You could build a roguelike where, instead of having one hero replay the same fight, you have an endless swarm of fresh recruits, each trying to save the realm or whatever. Each playthrough adds legacy to the weapons as they use them. Such a game would have a meta-progression unique to the player, based on their play style, habits, and history. You could double down on it and let the player choose how a weapon progresses similar to a level up screen, or maybe just make it transparent what acts unlock what abilities/stats. I'd play the hell out of that game.",0,0,2018-05-31T12:38:06.000Z

"My concern with blockchain in games is everyone needs to have a copy of the ledger that can be hundreds of gigabytes in length, which only grows even larger with with time, and every new player needs to download the full ledger before they can even begin to play with it. Having to download such a huge file just to install a game would be a huge turnoff. I can't even get into a thing like Bitcoin because I'd need to buy a whole new hard drive just to store it, and that's for something I could be making a return on. With a game, you're just keeping track of events, and the game needs to be constantly checking those events with others, taking up precious resources that are also needed by the game's physics and rendering engines. So the game would just keep getting bigger over time, taking up more and more disk space, and would either be costly to play by having to power your GPU for intense processing, or would be a slog because you'd have to sacrifice performance and graphics just for background number crunching.

Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of a decentralized online game, since basically it would be extremely hard for it to die since it's not depending on any single company's servers, but there needs to be a way to fight the bloat and preserve performance. I just don't think we're ready for a blockchain game.",0,0,2018-05-31T12:35:38.000Z

"Hello, Extra Credits. I am your grateful viewer from Russian Federation! Let me say a few words about change of main voice of your series. I was able to understand all of what Daniel Floyd ever said, so you can assume my level of english from that.  As i have never study in english school or university, never lived in english speaking community, the clarity and speed of any english speaker is much more important for me then to a native person. That is especialy true for any term-rich content (like yours)! Unfortunately, i had to leave few channels before as they changed their main voices. However, Matthew Kroll is a great narrator in my oppinion, i liked his voice a lot. Even if i am absolutely fine with Matthew being narrator, some of my friends were a bit upset with his speed, it was harder for them to understand some parts of the video without my help.

Cryptomining on players computers is an awful idea. Like with the kitties, the only things you can do with cryptocurrencies is to mine, buy or sell them. It's just a colossal waste of energy. For many players their hardware/energy are inefficient/expensive enough that a simple payment would be more cost-efficient. It's only a way to get users to pay without them noticing.
There are some good ideas in this episode, but none of them really need a blockchain since you usually have a trusted party (the devs running servers) anyway. Blockchains are only useful if you have many parties involved that don't trust each other or if you want to decentralise your software, which would at least be interesting from a technical perspective but does not affect the user facing side of the game much.",27,1,2018-05-31T12:08:31.000Z

Might be that my understanding of it is wrong, but all of the things mentioned in the video that could be done in games can easily be done without BlockChain. 

From what I get the whole point of BlockChain is to have a network of machines that verify the data and make sure it's not tempered with (let me know if I'm wrong, please).

"Great episode :D About using block chains for items in online games. It would be a cool concept, as long as it's worth/ingame value is regulated in some way. Just throwing it out into a free market where the players influence the price for it would decimate the ingame economy. A ""named weapon"" would end up selling for millions, making it avaliable only to the people that are veterans & are just looking for a nice weapon to use while leveling up a new job/character. It would also be a money making machine for real money traders. Maybe setting a lower and upper limit on what you could sell it for on the free market, based on the current economic climate would work, but that requires a seperate program to calculate that + a real live person checking if people isn't manipulating the market to achieve a higher sell for their items. The mmorpg Final Fantasy XI had a somewhat similar system, with their relic weapons, where you needed to trade in certian rare items to level up your weapon, but both the items needed for this, and the weapon itself were then exclusive to you, non-tradeable. Making an online game where these sort of items were commenplace, and on a free market would be a wonderfully creative & fun experience I'm sure, but it wouldn't really be something I'd personally invest money or time into.",0,0,2018-05-31T09:27:57.000Z

As other's in the comments have said, you can do with a little less energy and aim for a more explaining tone. Also, take off your hat; I know you want to look cool and all, but , again, you're a teacher and wearing a hat indoors makes you look like you've got something to hide.

I do have one pet peeve about this episode. I'm not audio professional or audio enthusiast, but you hit some words harder than others and it was not fun to listen to with headphones. Is your microphone setup using some kind of a pop filter by chance? If it isn't, that might help deaden some of the words you seem to pronounce harder than others.",0,0,2018-05-31T08:59:33.000Z
"There is a webcomic that does this - Erfworld. They added a downloadable miner so that fans could use their idle processing power to raise money for the comic. It was linked to a collectable system, of completely worthless pixels, but the webcomic was able to remove all ads for everyone on the website. The collectables can be sold on a marketplace, and that money (also earned via Patreon effectively) counts towards purchases on the merchandise. So effectively, if you have a nice computer and let the miner run while you sleep, you have a chance of getting a collectable, which you can sell for their currency, but that currency can be spent in place of real money for buying t-shirts, or print copies, or keychains, or yanno, real physical items. It worked out incredibly well, because fans may not have money to support a Patreon, but they can donate their cpu idle time.

I use my CPU idle time for World Community Grid - it goes to researchers analyzing every single DNA strand for cancer markers, something that takes forever. And supercomputer use time is expensive. But thousands of people can together make up for that.

- Some applications work well enough using a trusted central entity and their database.

- This also means that new players joining an MMO late have to download increasingly larger chains the longer the game exists.
- Also affects people who have been offline for a while.
- Verifying a blockchain is an extremely costly O(n), expanding it is also very costly, by design. A database query is fast.
- It is very hard, almost impossible, to remove unwanted entries from the blockchain, such as illegal things inserted using vulnerabilities, or such as rare items achieved by cheating or exploiting glitches.",361,27,2018-05-31T08:40:41.000Z

"I think the two examples for blockchain in games really fall flat. You can do items with history just as well with a centralized game back-end. And using mining to pay does not make it free-to-play. You're only preying on people who don't understand that mining costs electricity, which is rather immoral if you ask me.

The one and only purpose of blockchains is to ensure that a digital resource can not be controlled by a central entity (props to Cryptokitties for controlling it anyway). I think the real use-case for blockchain in gaming is open-source games without a central server. Blockchain allows you to have a shared world without creating hosting costs for the developer, the main killer of open-source MMOs. Of course this means no real-time gaming, because you would need a central trusted server for that and then you no longer need a blockchain. But imagine some round-based game like civilization. I send warriors to your village. The hash of the next block is the random seed that goes into calculating the outcome of the battle and because the attack is in the chain there are no taksies backsies.",0,0,2018-05-31T07:43:39.000Z

Really enjoyed this, and as much as the more optimistic heirloom blade idea would be Utterly wonderful, something tells me the publishers rushing for this new gold rush will probably just implement it in the simpler money-for-tokens manner. Still, it would be cool to see something like that, even maybe evolve it so if in the early days a player leaned towards a certain skill with the weapon, it adds levels in that skill or a cooldown reduction for the heirloom elements once it passes on?

"Sorry, but... no. You can do things like endless history of objects without blockchains. Blockchains just make sure that in decentralized systems that history cannot be tampered with. If you have a central server for your game, (like pretty much all do) all of that would be pointless fluff.

Also: Mining crypto currencies on your customers hardware is a terrible, TERRIBLE idea. Your app will be hated, because it drains power, heats up the phone (even more so then games normally do) and in the end, that still costs money. Electricity isn't free, even on smartphones. So no, it's not ""true free to play"", it's constant, hidden micro-transactions.

"Matt, we’re all glad to have you here, but do you think you could tone down the “performance” in your voice just a notch? 
We who are already here listening about these crucial and interesting aspects of games have been doing so by allowing a calm, but passionate voice describe them to us, some of us for more than a decade. 
There’s simply no need to sensationalize and glamorize these things that over a million people are already so interested in when it’s already been proven so strongly that all james’ words need is a quiet and direct dignity.
Your tone is certainly not the worst way to read a couple of lines, in fact it fits perfectly for many other youtube channels, even educational ones. Here, however, I just don’t feel like spicing up every word as if you’re selling each one to us is the right way to go.

"I'm aware of a website that has used a blockchain miner to game-ify mining for the purpose of removing advertising from the site, and has now done so. There are no ads anymore.
The gamification involves a pseudo gambling thing. As the client runs and you get hits, it generates spins for you to take on the site. Spinning gets you either gems or poker cards. Said gems and poker cards can be used in monthly on site contests and/or collected and bought/sold for the (already existing) site currency, which was given to people who supported via subbing (still an option) and can be used for either tipping good posts on the forum, now buying the collectibles, or converted to credit on their store for physical goods related to the comic.
They've said they're not quite replacing all of their income from ads with their subs and mining, but it's close enough given how much time they waste dealing with 'bad' ads (play sound, pop over scam ads, etc... from highly rated ad partners no less) that they killed all the ads anyway.
It's the webcomic http://www.erfworld.com/ if you want to look at it, their thing for the mining is 'mine4erf'. ironically, the pc version of the client is currently not downloadable for some reason or other.",0,0,2018-05-31T05:33:06.000Z

"Matt, I'm trying to be open minded here, you're an enthusiastic person that's really good at voice over, but I've got to say, your delivery is a little too.. SHAMWOW for the show. Back when Dan was running this, I could almost sleep due to how gently he delivered the lines. It felt as if he was reading a bedtime story and that's a good thing, considering I have anxiety. You, however, feel as if you're punching or prodding me on occasion, with certain syllables, trying to get me to buy something. As I said before you're enthusiastic but it's a little much and totally jarring when compared to Dan's delivery. 

Yes, I'm aware you are your own person but I feel going from ASMR to *_SHAMWOW_* like this, is a little too different to start out with, in my opinion, anyway. To me, it would've been wiser had you imitated Dan's style while adding some of your own flare before working up to this kind of delivery. Would've made it easier for me/some others though I'm sure I'm part of the minority on this one. 

That being said, you're not bad by any means, nor are you impossible to listen to. You have a nice voice, clear audio and passion, but I have to let my uneasiness be known because, right now, I don't feel relaxed. I feel as if I should've bought something or watched an excitable infomercial which is a little much especially when you're used to soothing tones while watching this show. It's also a little odd hearing an actual voice come out of this cartoon character but I'm willing to give that three more chances before considering it something that needs to be changed, after all, we're all getting used to this new management so don't worry about this just yet.

"The idea of the sword becoming legendary by being wielded by many players is really cool, but the idea of it being affected by things the player does after selling it would seriously diminish its quality. After, say, 100-150 players the sword would start to accrue value just by sitting there. It would encourage players to game the system by hanging onto a sword that is *now* not very valuable, but that in a few months will become very valuable. Which sort of diminishes the community aspect of this. Plus, keep in mind just how many weapons a player might wield. Such a stat would become worthless because it would be applied to hundreds of weapons all at once. Furthermore, you could easily cheat this system. Just have a high level player use a bunch of weapons for the minimum amount of time for it to count (which could in theory be as low as 'having owned it for any amount of time') and then give them to a sock account, or a friends account. Then, that high level player can go complete a high level event and create a whole bunch of money. This would ruin the scarcity, and only one or a small handful of people would benefit.

It works far better with just what is done with the sword, rather than what is done by the owner of the sword.",0,0,2018-05-31T04:05:00.000Z

That would also need a system to  value the titles of the weapon differently and only show some(perhaps with a function to look up it's history) so as the name does not take up the entire screen. Also another thing that it might be cool to have is a mechanic for forgetting titles and having to do quests to get them and the power back; especially if it's a rouge-like mmo where the equipment of dead characters is put in boss loot piles.,0,0,2018-05-31T03:44:25.000Z
"The system described in the eventchain sword is more or less an evolution of 3 things:
-Name modifiers of equipment
-Random passing player interaction along the veins of Dark Souls and Journey
-Simulation of a lineage in an evolving structure, like we see in Shadow of Mordor

As others have mentioned, you don't need blockchain to do any of these, and blockchain could actually be the inferior option. Blockchain benefits the most from having seeds that truly cannot be copied, but the nature of abstracting events into categories and translating them into mechanical benefits severely limits how complex your seed can be before the only benefit is in security.

The main barriers for such mechanics have always been balance and how much data needs to be stored and passed around. 

Balance is simply not something that can practically be done. For every conceptual step more personalized you can make the sword or cat or I dunno, a digimon, you need to put a hundred times more thought into predicting potential outcomes to balance it all. It's better to give up on balancing it at all, which means the kinds of games you can make are limited by a large degree. By design, 95% of any given object created through truly unique seeds would be useless and need to be artificially buffed with such precision that you only see it in manga or anime. And linking that to blockchain would mean a LOT of people would lose their money.

Blockchain never solved the issue of dataflow, they only made it worse and then devoted every processing resource to handle it instead of, say, the game itself. Every time you try to make each individual piece more unique, the system as a whole will run slower and be less efficient. We already have plenty of this type of problem WITHOUT adding blockchain into the mix.


Don't get me wrong, I would LOVE it if you could systemetize the creation of histories that can be passed between players. We have a small collection of those types of deals, but nothing that has a low enough barrier of entry to stick into an MMO, or has a short enough delay to gratification. But blockchains are not how it's going to happen.....unless you go full crazy and make the history compatible and analogous to something in MULTIPLE games from MULTIPLE brands/companies.

"Had to look up what blockchain is vs regular in game currency. Basically a branching rather then centralized system of fun bucks:

""A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks (the most recent transactions) are recorded and added to it in chronological order, it allows market participants to keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping. Each node (a computer connected to the network) gets a copy of the blockchain, which is downloaded automatically."" - Investopedia",0,0,2018-05-31T03:22:06.000Z

"That MMO sword example doesn't require blockchain technology at all. You could just do it with a regular database on your servers, which you'd be running anyway if you're making an MMO.

Now, you might be able to make an MMO which doesn't have any servers (and thus can keep running forever so long as it has players) by using blockchains to keep track of the game's state. It would need to be a pretty slow-paced, or more likely a turn-based game, though. Typical network latency tends to be on the order of 300ms, after all. That's not a problem for cryptocurrencies or a crypto-stock-market, but it is a problem for games. At best a distributed game state could be updated maybe once per second.

There have been several controversial server shut downs recently, of official servers and of copyright-violating fan servers attempting to revive their dead favorites. Seems like AAA studios would be more interested in building MMO models with lower risk, lower upkeep, and indefinite lifespan. And games should almost certainly not copy blockcoin's typical power or memory hungry proof-of-work model. I mean, your gpu is already busy playing your cool game.

"There are huge problems with decentralisation of something so heavily monitored and tweaked as a game, and considering how slow block chains are, it's gonna cause synchronisation issues.
There needs to be a central server.
And everything you explained could be done with a normal game as well. Not just that but it could be easier to maintain.
the only blockchain part could be 'tying the wallet to your character' so you can only play the game while mining a minimum amount per second. You can give random drops to players to players who finish a block. This would reward players who give more resources to the mining with more rewards without actually impacting the gameplay all that much (main 'rare items' are found in stores anyway, not from drops). 

Finally, another thing you can't do decentralised is weapon destruction either by deletion or in-game destruction. You want your weapons to both have a limited life span and to allow for repairs. Truly rare or valuable swords won't be lost this way, but the market won't flood with beginner swords. The 5 swords our now lvl 500 players outgrew before he defeated his first special boss don't have special value anyway. They shouldn't. Also, forging two non-legendary swords together would also help against this clutter. You can have entire sword ancestories through it (only caveat is that it can't become legendary from it's ancestor's wielders).

I can already see this game happening. It would be great. Blockchain not needed.

Blockchain's strength is to 'calculate and store'. Files that grow and grow, not to use. A true peer-to-peer blockchain game like the one described could get very slow if too many people play it for too long.",0,0,2018-05-31T01:14:49.000Z

But what happened to dan?,0,0,2018-05-31T00:56:01.000Z
"I'm not certain that effective ASIC resistance is feasible, but I suppose it could be.

Regarding there being a fee to sell or breed the cryptokitties, one thing to note is that all actions on the Ethereum block chain inherently have a fee. It is not possible to design it such that there is no fee. Transactions won't be included in a block if miners don't benefit from including it. However, it is possible to re compensate for that fee precisely, so that the person making the transaction is no worse off, but the game would need some way of funding this.

I don't know if this is what you were describing in the part about the fee when breeding the cryptokitties, or if there is an additional fee which goes to the developers, in addition to the fee that goes to the miners.

If your goal is to have a game where actions in the game take place on a blockchain, and where the changes to the blockchain state don't need to be paid for, sorry, but I don't think that is feasible. (Maybe using something like one of those ""block tangle"" ideas could work, but it seems like people are having a hard enough time getting the incentive structures right to make those work correctly for currencies, so I'd not be too hopeful for it to work for purely game state stuff)

Now, one option could be to have the game actions be possible to put on a blockchain, as a sort of anchor to resolve disputes about game state, but to have it effectively never come to this, so that players almost never have to make an actual on chain transaction.

This could work if you, say, for example, wanted to bet with someone on which of you would win some game. Though, this would still at least require transactions at the start and end of the game, so there would still have to be some fee (though it may be on the order of a few cents, or maybe even less than a cent? I don't remember what the current ""gas prices"" are on Ethereum.

If you want things to be cheaper, do less things on chain.

If you want it to be entirely free, don't use a blockchain.",0,0,2018-05-31T00:55:05.000Z

"Problem with block chains as you imagined at in the end, is that it wouldn't be 'free'. You'd be stuck in a perpetual payment with said game. Now I admit, many games use your GPU regardless (think Ark Survival Evolved. That thing MELTS GPU's) but by playing, and using your GPU to the max, which admittedly not every game out there does, you'd have to use your GPU at full speed. This in turn, means that A. you're paying for electricity (Say for example a GTX 1080 a very popular GPU, uses 180 watts at max load. Take a look here: http://prntscr.com/josrek for the math) you'd be looking at about $187 in electricity cost, just to run that GPU, that's without taking into account fans/cpu/ram power consumption.

Now you hopefully won't play for 24 hours a day, 365 days a week. Say you play, 5 hours a day, you're still looking at about $40 (math http://prntscr.com/joss2y) every year, or about $3 ish bucks a month.

My point is, that it wouldn't be free, plus running your GPU at max means that you're slowly ticking down that lifecycle. Just like the cpu, a fan, or any other mechanical component, it has a limited life, and max loads are the fastest way to tick down their life.

With blockchain that could be more feasible now, characters that aren't bound to being stuck on a single server and actually have their server change as they go from country to the next thanks to an in-game mechanic that makes the whole process free to the player. This would include events where the servers of certain countries are opened to players in other countries, with a little added bonus tied to the nations the event is connected to, so that the players can learn a little about the cultural significance of that holiday in the nation or nations the event is tied to. Blockchain could allow for the freedom of movement between the servers of nations I envision.

Short of a game becoming a truly distributed thing (ala Netrek) blockchain is just overhead. All the attributes of blockchain can be expressed far more cheaply by just keeping the data around.

"Hi! I'm a blockchain dev and I have to say I'm a bit... disappointed by this video.

First of all, welcome Matt. You're entertaining and you have a cat. There is no way I can argue with that.

Now, on the two examples you give for blockchain usage, I don't think they are the best of ideas. Your first example (the progressing sword) can be done without blockchain. I mean, the database tools to do that existed way before blockchain was a thing and having a centralized database will make things easier to handle for the big MMO studio that wants to do it. In terms of gameplay, it feels like an awesome idea. In terms of implementation, you wouldn't gain that much by using blockchain (you may even loose possibilities in terms of moderation, bugfixing and upgrading).

Your second proposal (paying by mining) is (and I'm sorry to say this, I love this channel) a really bad idea. First of all, if there is money in mining, there will be an ASIC (or comparable) that does it better. GPU mining is not something you want to do. Also, some countries decided to ban cryptocurency exchange. Those legislation might change one way or another but that puts your game at risk of becoming suddenly illegal. That means your players could become criminals (and not in a fun GTA way). But the true problem with that is that mining from your own house is a wrong move today. The money you produce is less than your electricity bill and your GPU chip ages *way* faster. I'd much rather pay money directly to the developers. Modern blockchains are actually trying to move away from Proof-of-work (the base for mining) and that model may not be even relevant in less than a year.

But it's a good thing that you talk about this and here's a way blockchain could be great for game devs: no need for server deployment. I never worked in games, but I guess that a small indie team may struggle with making sure to have a constantly running physically secure server farm. Those are not cheap. You can put all of that in a blockchain (dedicated or not), and players would have to pay for the maintaining of the chain (either by money if it's on a generic blockchain or by CPU time on a dedicated one). This would allow a small team with little means to launch successful multiplayer games without ever being limited by their servers.

Of course, there are other uses but remember, blockchains are useful, but not that useful. It's not the database part (and certainly not mining) that makes them awesome. It's the distributed aspect. Big companies probably won't use it for the same reason that Youtube or Netflix don't use Bittorrent. But small project may find a way to make incredibly cool use of that technology. Watch out for them. In the meantime, pledge allegiance to Zoe, our guide and savior.",3,1,2018-05-30T23:40:59.000Z

I have also been thinking about using blockchain as a mechanic in gaming, and I really liked the idea of items being unique and evolve depending on events. Additionally, I have been thinking about how MMOs can use blockchain, not only to mine bitcoin and pay that way, but also to use as a way for players to collectively adding CPU power to the server. So now, instead of having a central server, online games use players as resources and making the servers, and, ultimately, the gaming experience better.

"I think that a heroic deed upgrading system like that wouldn't be terrible, but I believe it would have major consequences. Cons: Such a system would probably need to be implemented in the design of a game rather than an update, as most games would have a system which fulfils the same purpose; A system like that would probably have to dominate any progression tree, as early game weapons probably can’t be upgraded to end game standards or be used through ought the game in most scenarios, and as such the progression system would have to fit into the mold of the heroic deed system as well as the other variables; Such a system would probably take up too much storage space and processing power, since the game would have to store the data for how many kills or other large-quantity actions are done and would have to manage the counter for everything done for everything counted for all your equipment being used. In my opinion the best way for a system like this to be implemented is by having a weapon acquiring system of finding, buying, and crafting in which different materials have different attributes like weight, hardness, and malleability and magic properties like repairing from slaying things, doing more damage to the undead, or making you 50% faster while using it. Then having the heroic deed system be locked to a weapons material. Then to make it dynamic titanium can be undeniably stronger than iron and can be upgraded into steel while keeping its heroic deeds or even randomly upgraded like Snake Blood Forged Iron. Or they can be upgraded by adding things to it like Electrified Copper Sword or Diamond Tipped Steel Spear. Then you could add in a third upgrading system such as runes with you can find, buy, or craft using very magic, very expensive ink which lets you channel magic through a piece of equipment to do say 20 points of ice damage, and maybe runes could even get their own heroic deeds like Ice Rune of Fire Golem Slaying which you could then take off the weapon to add a new layer of upgrading which  would incorporate magic. Heroic deeds could also be given to say a mask that you wore while killing a thousand goblins that then becomes The Mask of The Goblin Killer which would make weaker goblins flee from you and stronger ones target you.",0,1,2018-05-30T23:04:21.000Z

"I am intrigued by the potential example provided, but I have questions of how one would go about implementing it (Not a criticism, just brainstorming). For the sake of convenience, lets call this system of inherited titles and buffs Legacy Bonuses.

First, this system guarantees that the first players won't get the most out of this system. They will blaze through content that progress in the way MMO equipment does but won't find equipment that is of use to them without any Legacy Bonuses.They may find enjoyment from giving Legacy equipment to other players, or enjoy the monetary benefits from selling the equipment, but they won't get the best out of the bonuses themselves.

How would you monitor the power curve of your game with this system? I like the idea of beating final bosses with level 1 weapons possessing huge stacks of Legacy Bonuses but what incentive would I have to play the game if I can waste anything with a special sword that exchanged hands over 200 times? 

What would you do about Legacy farming? I can see a situation where players buy up 50 basic swords and then grinding 50 unique Legacy Bonuses so they can sell higher value equipment. I feel like having thousands of Legacy basic swords would devalue them in the game market. 

How would you organize the market? Obviously Legacy equipment needs to have a higher monetary value, otherwise who would ever buy the basic weapon? But it still needs to be within reach of the player who would use it. If 200 people passed around a basic sword to the point where it does ten times it's base damage then it would likely be too high priced for the player who would benefit most from it. Would a glut of low level equipment with Legacy Bonuses cause a huge decrease in higher level equipment being circulated?

Should there be an extrinsic reward for collecting Legacy Equipment, aside from the bonuses themselves? There will always be players who will collect them just to collect them, but would it be a good idea to have a mechanic where players could exchange the Legacy Equipment for in game currency?

I'm sure there are more things to think about with this kind of system but this is what I've got right now.",0,0,2018-05-30T22:52:11.000Z
"For the ""Blockchain sword"" game you were discussing... I feel like it doesn't really carry any weight in a traditional MMO. Now with something like Permadeath, where the only thing you leave behind is your character's legend on the world... you might be able to make something really special.

Pair this with destructible towns that grow over time and need player help to gather said resources to grow and you have a sort of in-built quest system that you can create events with by throwing wrenches into. The mines breach a subterranean monster's lair, making stone or ore dangerous to mine until the monster is killed. The orcs have built a stronghold deep in the forest where the town gets it's lumber, and they have regular patrols harassing lumber harvesters. Stuff like that.Do it right, and you wouldn't even have to write the quests. The players will see a problem (or be pointed to it by a helpful NPC) and either try to fix it themselves or organize a party to go do it. (There may need to be an indestructible castle or something for the town to regrow around and for anyone who was staying in town while logged off to come back to)

You wouldn't need a world quite the scale of a traditional MMO, just large enough to distribute the players so that every problem just isn't immediately solved by every single player on the server crashing into it all at once.

Once all the little niggling questions and problems get worked out, you could have a game that actually sidesteps the MMO story problem: the player's actions could actually have a real, meaningful impact on the game world.",0,0,2018-05-30T22:52:06.000Z

"That hypothetical sword reminds me of how Artifacts are said to work in Tyranny; special weapons, accessories, articles of clothing/armor, and so on are said to have gained their powers from previous owners whose use of them increased the item's renown.  Off the top of my head, there's Dauntless, a sword used by Champions of Stalwart in many a battle and whose mere presence inspires the troops.  In-game, Dauntless can daze foes on a critical hit and also has a manually-activated power that stuns all nearby enemies.  The latter power can be made even more potent through the player's repeated use of the sword.  Presumably, Dauntless was once just an ordinary bronze xiphos, having only become the weapon it is now thanks to its reputation.",0,0,2018-05-30T22:18:52.000Z

3) the cat.... feels strange to have this. i guessing your a cat person but. it just strange to see it in a extra credits video, at least the way it done here. but i going to guess you want to do your own thing with the show and thats fine, just remember that you may lose some older fans if you go to far. and yeah you did play it safe here. not over using it, i suggest you keep it to about the same level as you did here, for the near future.

"Using blockchain to progressively level up a sword is an example of pounding a nail with a sledgehammer. In this instance, it's far more efficient and more secure for this to be done with traditional ""central server"" methods. You also run into the potential for 51% hacks due to to things like outages.
As for mining F2P, trust me...this isn't going to last. Mining is already an ecological disaster to the point that some CC's (like Verge) eschew it entirely, and mining has already for the most part long since passed viability. ASIC-proofing is simply adding more algorithms, all which could easily have their own dedicated processors to handle. Unfortunately, there are 51% attack exploits that can drop far lower than that since it's likely one of these algorithms will be highly underutilized. (iirc there was an 0.4% attack involving Scrypt mining for some altcoin)

In any case, mining F2P is not viable.",51,8,2018-05-30T22:02:07.000Z

"Hey Matt, Welcome aboard :) 

I enjoyed the episode but there is one specific nit to pick.  It may seem pedantic, but it's kind fo important.  At about 1:03 you describe blockchain as a kind of a distributed database, but that is not correct. It is a Distributed Ledger.  

Warning!  Giant Wall of text below.  This kind of grew out of hand.  My feelings will not be hurt if readers just skip to the bottom and tell me I am wrong ;)

The best way I can explain the difference is with a Bank analogy.  In a Database, your checking account balance is stored in a field in a table.  That number is updated every time your transactions are approved by the bank. If you want to know your balance, you do a simple Database query for that value. In a blockchain, your initial deposit is added to the ledger, then every transaction that adds or subtracts from that amount is added as a separate entry. When you want to know your balance, you start at the beginning and scan the ledger for all your transactions, adding and subtracting entry by entry until you have a final balance.  If all you want to do is store and retrieve data, an actual database is much faster.  It will be a long time before any blockchain can catch up even to current DB speeds. 

You use a blockchain when you want  distribution and Immutability. I'm going to suggest a variation on your mining Idea.  Instead of Mining Bitcoin or Etherium, lets mine a currency specific to the game.  Lets call the currency Beads and the ledger is called the BeadChain.  If we say that we have a reasonably popular game with an average concurrency of 50,000 players, you would have 50,000 people maintaining the Beadchain at any time. (The point of Mining is to maintain the blockchain,  Getting the currency is the reward for doing so).  That means you have 50,000 copies of  the ledger being maintained simultaneously and each person playing has an up-to-date record of every transaction that has ever taken place for every player in the entire history of the Game.  These records are updated in what we used to call Near Real Time, so there would be a delay between you getting your sword and the Beadchain being updated. Could be minutes or hours depending on the the block generation time of the BeadChain.  The Upside of this is that to even have a chance of successfully attacking the ledger requires the baddie to successfully control the computers of more than half of the Active players in a given block generation period. The reward for that work will be the ability to alter the current block.  Honestly, if you have 25,001 computers under your control, there are much more profitable things you can do. 

OK.. that's enough of that :)  Maybe later I will pretend that my poop doesn't stink and share my ideas for how to use Distributed ledgers.in a gaming context.",0,0,2018-05-30T21:52:26.000Z
"I think the best way to make Matt a new Dan is to have him defeat Dan Prime in Battle of the Dans. It's the only way!

A great thing about EC is that it is contemplative. You have great energy, but I think for this channel you could dial it back a few notches, to give us the information, pose the questions, and give us time to think it out with you as you present it. So a little slower, not as loud, and a slightly calmer delivery would be great. Then again, I might be saying this just cause I am soo used to Dan.

See Dan leave after so many yrs it almost like mario leaving Nintendo, it just doesn't feel the same. Please don't think I'm writing Matt off as a poor replacement, it's just going to take time to get used to. Dan departure was sudden and that what makes it hard to adjust to this change.

"I'd like to see something like that blockchain sword, but the problem I see is that...well, unless there are procedurally-generated unique raids or something, you're going to need to lean hard into the more mundane ""weapon achievements"" (""kill 10,000 ghouls"" and whatnot) and/or produce plenty of unique or highly-limited story content. Which isn't impossible, nor would it make for a game I wouldn't want to play (quite the opposite!), but it certainly limits your design space.",191,16,2018-05-30T21:11:49.000Z

"That sword example was actually really cool.

I think this would work well in a singleplayer game too, instead of leveling up the character, as you progress through the game, the sword itself get's better (or any object actually). This could be fun even in non combat  scenarios. For exaple, let's imagine a fishing rod, as you chought more and more fish of more and more difficoulty to cach, the fishing rod get's an upgrade that... Idk... gives you a 10% chance increase to cach the specific fish. (this is just an example).

As for the multiplayer aspect, this could work well in a strategy game where different people govern certain countries. As a country was conquered, the new ruler gets a title like ""Conquerer of the *place"" or ""Great ruler of the *people that are ruled"" or something like that.
With time the names would get very messy
Imagine for exaple that this game was the real world, Tokugawa Ieyasu would have a title like:
Shougun of Japan, original ruler of the Mikawa province, co-conqueror of (most of Japan, here there would be a list), ecc

(this is just an example to show the point)

"Free to pay with your energy bill - yeah. Please do not do that. I rather pay for the game.
Blockchain for the attributes: That is a really cool idea - but... why do we need Blocks again for that? It would be much simpler to use a plane database for that - especially when the item upgrades when a previous owner slays the final boss. Yes you can use an elaborate block chain technology for that - or you just keep a list of previous owners and previous ""heroic things"" in a database. On a side note: I wonder how out imbalanced such a system would become. Having a beginners sword upgrading to a heirloom sounds great - until your level is to low either use it or to progress to an area  where the sword is useful. (it does not help when you epic sword can one shot level 100 enemies, but a level 10 archer can kill you with a stray shoot as you may have a power full sword, but not enough health to survive)

"Hello there Matt, good to meet you at last. 

I don't see progressive legend weapons catching on. The trouble is that it's a data management nightmare. The file on each weapon would be unique so unlike normal weapons you can't just reference the data, you need entirely unique entries for each in game weapon. When you've got millions of players with hundreds of weapons each and each weapon could have who knows how many titles...yeah that's more trouble than that function is worth.

Crypto funding is also a problem because Crypto-currencies are inherently untrustworthy. There's no holding the manager accountable so unlike central banks you don't have someone to throw into prison because they hyper-inflated the currency then shut down the servers and skipped town. 

E-commerce might be the best option with your money being held by a secure intermediary like Paypal but that has nothing to do with gaming.

I suppose you could use blockchain for managing player data, keeping track of everyone's items and such, but generally you don't need that degree of security and Blockchain's data transfer limitations makes it inconvieniant.",0,0,2018-05-30T20:25:16.000Z

"Aside from all the other problems (such as the many, many ideas that work fine with a normal database and gain zero value from a blockchain), ""free to play but we mine bitcoin on your GPU"" is not free, as it drives up your power bill by almost as much as the money you'd otherwise be paying -- almost by definition, since if this was actually a huge savings, someone would already be running a huge mining operation, driving down the price of the currency until mining is just barely profitable. It's a great way of obfuscating the cost of a game, which is... Unethical. And it's wasted electricity, which is a huge problem with current cryptocurrencies. Your voice is fine, I like your cat, but content-wise, this is a worrying start -- good on you for pointing out how much of a buzzword it is, but then you just uncritically bought into the hype.",0,0,2018-05-30T20:16:23.000Z

First of all,  centralized server can keep track of items just as well as block-chain.
But blockchain tech also has down sides, such as the time it takes to make transactions.

For people saying that their would be too many item possibilities for a server to track: It would actually be proportional to the number of players. The server already keeps track of all the stats about each player. Why not each of its items too? Storage is cheap.",0,0,2018-05-30T20:14:48.000Z

Someone with a much better understanding should really write up some rules for this kind of system.  Things like no mining when the game isnt playing, how much of the system you are alowed to use, security so that if this is like a bot net then the users can't send data to each other only back to the server.  It would be like how lots of games retrieve player behavior to make better games.  Great idea but could be used for very bad things.",0,0,2018-05-30T19:50:10.000Z

"You wouldn't need to use blockchain for the idea of making a sword level up with each deed it has done and there would be more efficient ways of programming this into a game, however, since a MMORPG usually has billions of items, making each one of those unique is a huge waste on storage space and it becomes even worse if you use blockchain technology.

Also, if you wanted to make a ""truly free to play"" game then you might get $1 if someone plays your simple 2d game for like 200 hours, so you'd be better off including ads or just selling your game.

I personally disagree with pretty much everything this video says and I don't think blockchain will become part of our video games soon.",35,11,2018-05-30T19:47:44.000Z

In gaming, you already trust the developers, so the whole system becomes fairly useless.

"I really don't understand blockchain. How does it make it any easier to have items build up better stats as they're used? A normal MMO can do just fine with letting players upgrade their gear before passing it on.
Also, I don't think that making items continue to grow from the exploits of their previous owners is a good idea. It creates the same toxic, you-can't-leave dynamic as so infamously traps the ""whales"" in typical MMOs. If you sell a piece of gear, the buyer would expect to pay more than it's currently worth for the expectation that your future play would make it better, and you would be letting them down and possibly even breaking a promise if you just get bored with the game and quit.
Besides, rewards feel best if the player feels like they earned them. If they do some impressive feat with a weapon and it levels up, they would think it was cool, and if they sold it the next owner would feel a combination of wonder at the legends attached to it and gratitude for those who came before and made the weapon better for them, as well as an inspiration to add further to the legend with their own incredible deeds. But if the weapon gained in power just because some guy you never met was still doing things, it would make them feel like the third wheel rather than the heir to a legend.",0,0,2018-05-30T19:36:00.000Z

"First off, welcome to the party Matt, a pleasure to meet you!

On the subject of the video: I think that the significance of blockchains, even as discussed in this video, is greatly oversold. The ONLY thing that blockchain does is create a tamper-proof database. This can be very useful, for sure, but is a lot more relevant to things like hack-prevention than it is for game mechanics. The ""unique items"" idea is very possible to implement without a blockchain, and the ""cryptomining f2p"" is functionally equivalent to ad-supported services, except you pay in battery life + your electricity bill rather than marketing and your attention (and just like ads, cryptomining has a LOT of potential for abuse).

What I'm curious about is, how viable is blockchain technology for *multiplayer games using peer-to-peer connections, specifically to prevent hacks and cheating?* In THAT context it makes sense that blockchain allows a ""unique item"" system, because you don't need a dedicated server to maintain the integrity of game information. And that's a discussion around empowering low-budget development/upkeep.",0,0,2018-05-30T19:34:23.000Z

"As a developer, let me tell you, blockchain have nearly no use in gaming (in fact, blockchain have nearly no use at all).

Let me explain, the very interesting idea of a unique weapon evolving with its use is awesome, and completely feasible with regular database (automatic uniqueness of data is a basic feature all database have). But, let see what the strength of blockchain have to bring here: considering its a mmo, that mean the database is hosted by the developers, so, the fact that the database can not be falsified is ... useless. 

In fact, for most database purpose in gaming blockchain is actually a BAD thing, if we can't modified it after an action has been recorded in it, that mean there is no way to reverse the action of a cheater, no way to reverse the consequence of a bug, no way to erase the data of a player (as the law in EU now require).

And i'm not even talking about thing like performance or complexity.

2. If every weapon in the game upgrades like that and there are thousands of players using weapons... is a sword with random names and stats all that unique? If everything levels up with time, is there some economy issue with all weapons? 1st day of the game, everything is hard, year later, there is flood of upgraded weapons...
3. Is blockchain needed for all that? Server needs to acknowledge stuff like killing a boss - if you can fake that, block chain doesn't help. You don't need blockchain to prevent duplication of items. You can have persistent data structure that tracks that without blockchain... Would throw other technical questions, but would end up too much of a speculation from just this video.",0,0,2018-05-30T19:20:50.000Z

"First: Welcome Matt.

Second:
The concept there is quite grand and grandiose that it could lead to games akin to the (in)famous anime Sword Art Online where we could see unique skills that no-one else could have, each character a true reflection of the players. A game could literally grow from basic beginnings (a primordial time) to the more modern time where those older skills no longer exist traditionally but now, very rare and VERY powerful from their time growing. Does cause a MASSIVE headache in terms of balance however I think in that instance you would be at the mercy of ""everything is broken so nothing is broken"" mentality.

It could even appear in more futuristic themes where in cybernetic alterations could augment a user in way not foreseen as it interacts with their other augments. Factors such as how long you have had each augment, when you installed it, where you installed, who installed and how, why was it installed (life saving or for general improvement). The reality where skills could appear out of no-where instead of just being added is awesome as it could also lead to some really interesting game world implications.
Players regularly training in a certain manner to get their skill to upgrade in a certain way is interesting but would also lead other players to maybe buck this idea and go and experiment, possibly develop their own unique powers. A game where those animes could become real in that your character is unique!

However there are some caveats. One issue is farming. We could see a world where players delete a character based purely on a random dice roll and start again or just not play again as their ""build"" doesn't work with what they got. The problem we would have to assess and it seems block chains could be made to avoid it in some way is the ""Min Max"" players of games, possibly even having entire groups bully another player because their skill ""isn't the optimal version"".
I suppose those will always exist but it must be considered.

In the end, usual issue arose with new tech because it is always the first question fat cats ask: ""Can it make money?""
Give it time, we will likely see other companies step forward with less greed backing them (ether internally or externally) and then we will truly see some awesome stuff pop out!",0,0,2018-05-30T19:20:29.000Z

Can you please put the cat subtitles on the screen for, like, half a quarter of a second longer? Generally the rule is, if it's on the screen for less time than it takes to read it aloud you should assume people can't read it. I loved the cat but I had to pause to read the second of the two subtitles, and I'm a decently fast reader too.

Also - I really love the potential that comes with this! As a player who loves anime's individualized powers, I have always idealized a game where most if not all players possess something totally unique to them. However, even utilizing tech like procedural generation and all those other long-forgotten industry buzzwords we haven't really been able to create something wholly unique each time. Perhaps, by utilizing a mix of block chains, procedural generation tools, and organic systems like the Middle Earth games' Nemesis system we can get closer than we ever have to such a game existing?

And for the features you described, no blockchain is necessary and doesn't have benefit.
ok, so there is a blockchain that guarantees you eternal ownership of an virtual item, but what is that worth if the game servers shut down?

Blockchain might make sense for cross-game / cross-company items (or achievements?); to ensure ownership without a central authority.
Or to facilitate game ownership and trading, you can only play a game if the blockchain confirms you own it.

The game is going to be the sole arbiter of what information gets stored and how its stored and what any of it means if anything, and you're not going to want to (for example) let players record their own transactions on the sword outside the context of the game. So the entire distributed nature of the records is basically moot. Just do it with a database. Save some time, save some effort, skip the whole ""consensus"" thing entirely. 

The other plan (mine other coins as payment for the game) seems like it's no end of bad. A fancy game should be USING that graphics card for graphics-drawing, not spinning it away on an incidental thing, and every core and megabyte that's mining is NOT going to be processing graphics. Even if the game is simple enough that most people have spare cycles from whatever the game actually uses, that's still representing electricity and heat spent on things not playing the game. It's not *free*,  you're paying ConEd triple for your playtime instead. (And this is setting aside the whole issue of ""how does this actually work, economically?"" Mostly all your developers and artists are going to want to be paid in filthy fiat money that they can spend on plebeian things like rent and groceries, which leaves a game company with an interesting challenge: liquidating a big chunk of cryptos into USD every single week in an unstable market that's already showing deep signs of being cash-poor and in danger of collapsing because the there's little to no legitimate banking access anymore.  I recommend that anyone even thinking this is a good idea go read the three linked posts here: https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2017/12/17/why-you-cant-cash-out-pt-1-why-bitcoins-price-is-largely-fictional/",0,0,2018-05-30T19:07:21.000Z

"I find that if a game you're playing is mining cryptocurrencies while you're playing, that is basically adding a hidden cost to your game. It's something we need to be extremely careful with. Cryptocurrency mining causes degradation of hardware and costs power after all.",1,1,2018-05-30T19:00:29.000Z
"Hey guys, big fan of yours, but I was a little concerned with this recent proposal you made about block-chain and specifically using on-the-side mining as a way to fuel free-to-play games. You left off making it sound like it was done-deal or at least you didn't go into too much detail on this, but I'd like to add a cautionary warning to anyone thinking about trying this.
1. Not everyone has GPUs that are even close to capable for crypto-mining, and attempting to may either burn out the GPU or lag the game too much. This could take the kind of R&D that only AAA companies have access to. If people go into this without doing their homework, they could have some serious lawsuits on their hands.
2. The inflow of cash will begin to decrease slightly for every additional miner. If those miners are not efficiently mining, this could cause more inflation, and a swifter drop in overall value, resulting in very little, to no cash-flow, maybe even negative, it would be worth grabbing some economics experts on this one.
3. This is actually pretty gimmicky, and I think it will be a long while before anyone clever enough, and already well-off enough can pull it off. I'm not trying to discourage the research, but please be careful suggesting this as a legitimate income idea, as it's very dangerous, and subject to a very turbulent and chaotic economy. 

Just a fair warning. 


Also, I don't really think Block-Chain is necessary to do the cool item legacy trick. It may even be a bit overkill. I just don't think you can really prevent people from spoofing legendary weapons (if they are determined to do so), so I don't quite get why you would need the intense security of a block-chain to hold that data.",0,0,2018-05-30T19:00:22.000Z

"Also as a developer: Don't be scared by the encryption. There should be plenty of libraries and APIs out that help you with that. And if you're just developing a fun game - maybe you can even make a ledger system without the crypto. The core concepts of blockchain are what make it so interesting, and even though I would discourage you from calling it a ""blockchain"" without the crypto, a ledger system might add a lot of interesting ways for items to work in your game.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:59:10.000Z
"I have to disagree with the first use case of blockchains. You can already have unique items with history and what not without blockchains because current game servers are centralized (in the same way banks can process transactions securely because they are centralized, without needing blockchains). What is special about blockchains is that they are, like you explained in the beginning, *distributed* databases. What makes them special is that they are the most resilient distributed system to store data, resilient enough that you can trust your money on it.

If you're not talking about a distributed system then blockchains don't have a purpose. There is, however, a powerful use of blockchains for games that I envision. Current multi-player game servers appear centralized. There is a world and everything is kept in sync, as if a single server is running it. But in actuality, big games (think huge mmorpgs) are being run distributed on multiple servers (called shards). Parts of the game don't need to be on the same server, so they can be spread out in order to handle more players. Examples are dungeon instances, different realms or regions of the map and so on. There needs to be some glue in order to keep everything in sync. For example, chat and trading systems need some hefty distributed messaging architecture in order to handle all the traffic in real time.

What blockchain can do is to handle all this glue that keeps shards running on different servers in sync and allow normal users run server shards themselves. You can't really do this without blockchains because a user might modify the shard software and hack or even break the whole game world. But with blockchains, their design can enforce coherence between all the shards and even allow independent developers to write their on shard software, since the magic of the blockchain is in the protocol, not the software that runs the protocol.

The problem here is that blockchains aren't really fit for real-time interactions. The more resilient a distributed system is, the worse its scaling and ability to handle traffic bursts are. Also, blockchain participants need to store a copy of the blockchain and validate it, otherwise it's value proposition is non-existing. I honestly don't see blockchains doing real-time games with the current technology.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:59:07.000Z
"Pretty good, not-a-Dan! I would like to see you get the higher pitched voice like Dan had, but other than that, I will not mind the change in narrator too much. Great video as well; the idea of the sword seems like something that could really be played around with. An interesting mechanic would be to add a limit where only each player's best achievement done with the weapon would contribute stats. This would shrink boosts for weapons kept to long, encouraging players to trade it away for an equal sword they can still apply a big boost to. Essentially, a sword you've never done anything with is suddenly much better than a sword you have done something with with the same stats, encouraging people to sell their used swords for others' swords.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:59:06.000Z

"Thught I just had after watching this: what if, other than the stuff the players made, the only non-consumable items that exist in a hypothetical game were the starting gear that everyone got. From there, the items would level up with the wielder, with special bonuses being given to the avatars who did special things, like be the first to beat a certain boss or be the highest level. The items would never despawn, even if someone logged out, they'd just be stuck in the player's house until they got back. These items might then be able to be taken from them if they were gone for long enough the game stopped protecting their house and someone stole the items, or the player died, where the player's shade would have a headstart to get back to their corpse, but once that was over, whoever found it first got to loot the body. Player made things would have higher base stats than the stuff you get at spawn, and would have better stuff perks when you do feats. This would encourage the players to a) interact with the crafting system and b) pass on their old junk to the next generation. This would lead to a mythos being built for the game, without the developers even needing to do anything but make some perks.

At that point you would both get boosts--you as a reward for the summoning, them so they could keep up--and you'd both get better loot.

"About cryptokitties: it is not a game, I agree. I lost a 100 euro's through it, which is not nice.

But it did teach me how Ethereum contracts work on the internet. I did have a fun time with my girlfriend buying a couple for the couple of hours we put into it.

Is that worth the price? Maybe, maybe not, but a couple of days later Ethereum went up and I sold a 100 euro's worth of Ethereum to cover for the costs. Did I really lose anything? I'd say it's pretty tough to say since I HODLed the rest and did not sell it at the peak, only to panic sell it later on (stupid mistake) and having the luxury of having my initial capital on my bank account +20% ROI and having *some* cryptocurrencies still left in the game (crypto trading itself is a game, a potentially very dangerous one). It is really tough to argue whether cryptokitties is a borderline scam when you look at the wild price movements and behavior in cryptocurrencies as a whole.

All I know is, I had an educational experience that I could've learned for cheaper, but at the same time I had fun while doing it. Vegas is more expensive anyway. When you're responsible it doesn't matter.

The thing is: when you get involved with cryptocurrencies of any kind, you need to be prepared to lose all of it. It is the wild west, and in the wild west you can lose your life. Putting all your eggs in one basket is a bad idea in this wild west and anyone who does not follow that advice will suffer the consequences because of it. Big warning signs are posted by users all over the place. The reason I post this is because I feel you imply that cryptokitties is bad. I feel it isn't, or maybe it is, but if it is, then it should be a criticism directed to cryptocurrencies in general. 

With that said, I really stand behind the criticism that the current state of crypto games are meh and a lot cooler stuff could be invented with it. And despite the fact that I wrote criticisms about the implementation details of the event/weapon upgrade system, I do think the idea in itself is much cooler than what we have seen so far. So from that perspective, in order to experiment with blockchain technology, I am all for it. Hypertext didn't invent itself in a couple of years as well. So we should give it some time.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:49:05.000Z

"Fun fact: You can have a blockchain without a distributed database. You could even have a blockchain without distributed ownership. The blockchain is nothing more than a ledger of ""blocks"" linked and secured with encryption. The ""distributed"" part of it actually comes from the fact that most applications of blockchain also use P2P network technology. Of course the marketing folks don't want anybody to know that P2P is making a comeback because it doesn't fit their narrative with cloud computing. But it's true - if you read the specs for Bitcoin, P2P is actually how they give blockchain the ability to be distributed and decentralized.

First of all the idea of having an item that gains value with use via recording what its done is both do able with current relational databases and far more efficient with them. If it was done with a block chain then each event would have to be synced across all computers running the program which would be MASSIVELY and prohibitively expensive, it would make the game unusable once there were enough players. The other thing is that there are no take-backsies, if an item becomes over powered on the block chain its there forever, unless you can convince everyone to fork, this is untenable.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:47:14.000Z

"I have to say, I’m a little disappointed that EC approached blockchain in the same way that I see a lot of other people do. Blockchain really isn’t going to have a lot of novel uses for games IMHO. It’s effectively just a data structure that the public could modify and view, if the developers want that. I fail to see what exactly an append only linked list secured by being viewable by the public and wasteful of electricity will do for game development.

The example they gave of tracking a sword’s history and giving it traits using some algorithm that tracks that sword’s history can be pretty easily implemented with our traditional-client server model for multiplayer games. The only thing keeping that sword on a blockchain would guarantee is that the developer can’t alter that sword or copy it without all players knowing.

It’s not even the case that a blockchain game can uniquely guarantee scarcity or prevent copying of item. Plenty of games have done that just fine already. And considering how much people loved Diablo 3’s real money auction house (sarcasm) I’m not sure what giving ownership over specific game object to the player from the dev accomplishes, because the only thing that springs to mind is the ability to sell/trade items.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:43:34.000Z

"Hey, I just got an extensive vision of the thing..... wouldn't that also allow to build a procedurally generated MMO that gains a history over time with regions linked to their past major events giving it more and more dept as the time passes. Also, NPCs, to give them a rich story as they live and die and cities would get built on these events. You could get immemorial grudges between kingdoms or friendship/birth and death of NPCs as they grow into major ones with power. Basically, a complex ecosystem based on less programming and design that would normaly be needed to make it.

If you include to is a form of legacy system where your character ends up dying overtime (let's say you loses part of your soul each time you die plus a loss over time due to ageing) keeping track of your great deeds, you could also make a custom tomb/dungeon where your ingame family would build you a mosoleum based on your financial worth+heroic deeds that would unlock new traps/rooms/ defenses and where all the items you colected could drop. In exchange it would bolster your soul for your next life in reincarnation. These tombs could also get occupied/pillaged by roaming monsters that could move these items.

It would gradually create an intricate world procedurally generated with a rich history and its heroes/crafters of legend, where coins and gear just don't spawn on mobs at random, allowing for a more realistic economy and where the size of the game world could be much larger than in handmade worlds.

"Wait, why do you need blockchain for that event mechanism? Blockchain is just a distributed database, running on all kinds of computers. The only thing it will ensure is that it is verifiable by users. Is it really worth that much? 

Here's an alternative: a database used by the game company creating such an event/weapon upgrade system would do the trick. By creating inspection tools for players to inspect the database, players could verify what the sword has done. Wouldn't it be almost as good? How strong do you want the verifiability to be? We now trust the leaderboards that World of Warcraft publishes, for example, what extra benefit would we get to store that on blockchain?

"The King is dead ! All hail the King ! Seriously though, Matt, you did a stellar job, and I wish you the best !

Also, I'd love to see such a blockchain system be used in games, but wouldn't it end up creating either a weird power creep or unsatisfying rewards (if items can be buffed by their former owners) ? For instance, if I just joined the game and purchased an old sword that suddently becomes ""Light's Edge, First Fragment of the Dragonslayer"" because the guy it belonged to just killed the end boss, wouldn't it ruin the initial experience of the game if my now OP sword does all the job ? Furthermore, if items improve the more you use them for heroic deeds, why even go new items ? Why would I want the newly released, and very rare, ""Greatsword of Woes"" when simply killing the boss improves my already mighty ""Worldbreaker, Ender of Worlds, Killer of Gods and Bane of Low Level Wolves"" ? I think the design problems it'd create in terms of balance in a MMO game are too great to see it realistically happen.

However, in games that would be largely single player but with multiplayer options (like Dragon's Dogma and its pawns), you could imagine a system where the actions of certains players have an effect on your game. Maybe you found a rare sword that belonged to ancient demon slaying hero allowing to wield their power, this hero being another player. Or maybe the items could grant more narrative effects : for example, you just found an incredible armour piece but the player you got it from was, in his game, a notorious assassin, thereby making friendly NPCs less friendly around you. Or maybe the axe you get for becoming master of the warrior's guild grants you bonuses hailing from a long line of previous masters - or players. I think that these instances would prove to be fantastic ways to add some diversity and depth to game worlds, making it feel less like your the only hero that ever mattered.",1,0,2018-05-30T18:36:06.000Z

Matt's voice really is... jarring for me. Not just that I'm used to Dan, but that there feels like a heavy disconnect between his voice and the visuals. 

Matt's voice in and of itself is actually pretty good, he's a fantastic presenter. But the visuals are calm, mellow, comfy pictures that mix well with the cute cartoon pitch voice Dan gave. 

Matt's voice is more excited, exuberant, and has a, of course, deeper voice to it. He reminds me of a lot of other youtubers and their style. But it doesn't really mix with the calm mellow comfy art style for me. The artstyle is cute, but the voice isn't. It's a weird mood whiplash for me.

"Matt is cool! I think he'll be a great addition to the team! 
Though, if I may, I do have thoughts and first impressions:
Firstly, a disclaimer, these observations are not to say whether or not they are good or bad for the show, and my comments are my own personal experiences and first impressions. 

Matt, compared to Dan, is much more enthusiastic. He is excited to talk about game design, and has energy that grabs your attention. He sounds like James talking about Extra History Lies in the events that lead to WW1, and that makes me interested in what he has to say simply because of his passion. He has a great energy, but I do have to make note that compared to Dan, I wasn't as invested. 
This is probably a personal bias, but I liked how casual Dan was talking in these episodes. His tone not only fitted the writing,  but also fit nicely with the slow animatic-like slides that visualize his explanations. The start of this episode was a little awkward, and part of it is because it sounds like the writing of the small jokes, and tone of the script sounded like it was written for Dan, and not for Matt. Personally, I believe the cat gimmick is unnecessary, but there's nothing really bad about it.
The writing after the beginning of the episode was done well, though there were at some points I felt like some explainations made me feel like I was a 5 year old being explained what a toothbrush was. I didn't know what any of that stuff was, and I need to watch the video a couple of times to get a basic grasp of crypto-currency(?) but I think the reason why I felt annoyed was because the tone did sound like I was being treated like a child. Maybe its because of Matt's energetic tone, but I personally think the line saying 'before we get into the cool stuff that games can use (subject) we need to know what (subject) really is' line could have been worded differently to fit Matt's persona better. This seems like a bit of a nitpick, but I am using it as an example to explain that since Matt seems to be here to stay, there maybe needs to be small adjustments to fit with Matt's voice?
Now, if I could change how Matt sounds, I would advise that he tones down his excitement. I'm happy he is a longtime fan, but now he is a part of the team. Maybe he should change his tone a little bit to make it sound less like we are being taught, but rather learning through a conversation. 
Matt, honestly, you sound like an enthusiastic teacher, and while that's not really a bad thing, Dan sounded a lot more personal. He sounded more like he was bringing a friend up to speed on a conversation, or a friendly boss giving his employees a small ""gist""  of what is going on in the office.
Honestly, maybe he doesn't have to reduce his excitement, so much as he needs to change his mindset. 
Matt, if you're reading this, maybe instead if thinking you are talking to a group of 100, pretend you're talking to a group of 5 people that you know. 
These are just my thoughts, and as cynical as I may sound, I don't think you're bad at all. Seriously, I probably just might have to get used to you. If nothing changes, I don't think there is any harm done. People in the comments like Matt, and so do I. Love this show a lot, and the team that puts out this work.

"You don't need a blockchain. Blockchains are a solution to a single problem - which was not discussed here - using them for anything else is overkill. A simple shared cryptographic ledger, published by the company, can achieve everything you described needing a blockchain for (heck I am pretty sure a simple relational database could), without needing the huge expensive waste of resources that is mining. You can use public private cryptography to control ownership of content (like a blockchain) but instead the company processes the transactions (not like a blockchain) and publishes the proof (like a blockchain).

The one thing blockchain provides, the thing that all that mining is necessary for, is trustless transactions, so unless your entire game server is on the blockchain (which is why crypto kittens is technically a blockchain game) you aren't running a trustless system (because the server/game-developer is being trusted to some degree). With a public cryptographic ledger, that trust can be verified, the company will be transparent (uniqueness and randomness can be verified post-facto with the ledger). But what you described can be done with a relational database and periodic dump of it's content (because you are still trusting the MMO servers for everything)!

In fact some people actually are calling this classic technology (it's over 30 years old!) ""blockchain"" because of the hype (see The Verge's ‘BLOCKCHAIN’ IS MEANINGLESS article). Things like ""permissioned blockchains"" or ""private blockchains"" have already existed as cryptographic ledgers for decades. There are some really cool things that can be done with cryptography and public ledgers and you didn't touch on a single one in this video (there are some kinda cool things that can be done with blockchains - trustless transactions - but they aren't worth it). You are buying into blockchain hype with this video and it disappoints me.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:28:18.000Z

"There is absolutely no need for blockchain in what was described in this video with the sword progression... The idea is cool, don't get me wrong; but blockchain (since you only need the ledger part of the blockchain, not the distributed trustlessness part of it.) only brings unnecessary overhead for stuff like the described idea. Blockchain is useful if said sword could be traded between different games by different designers/publishers, but from a single game or even single developer/publisher perspective there are MUCH, MUCH easier and less costly ways to do this.

Personally I think Achievements, Trading Cards, and Badges would be a good use of Blockchain in gaming. Steams trading card system is a PERFECT example of where the tech would be useful.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:27:02.000Z

Right now it sounds a lot like other commentary videos which sucks coming from such a long line of videos. Otherwise I think the delivery and stuff was great just that some parts were over emphasized.

As for the video it was great and I loved the applications talked about but it really needed a what is Block Chain either in the beginning or as its own video. As someone who couldn't care less about Crypto Currencies I have no idea what it is you're talking about just that it has applications.

"You know, I like the idea of attaching a linage to an item. Being able to trace it to the first player who had it, all the deeds associated with it. Pretty epic! Could even have it so that when the item is sold to an npc vendor for cash (If it's sold AFTER the player associated with it has done heroic feats) that the vendor resells it at a huge markup because of it's lineage, if it's sold to an NPC within a certain amount of time after achievement.

But I have to ask - Do you REALLY need blockchain for this? This sounds like a simple item history table in a database somewhere. What does having multiple servers confirm it's pedigree actually do (Which is the point of blockchain)? If players can already tamper with an item database to make a forgery or fake that item's history, I think the games developers have a bigger problem that  using blockchain to solve would be like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer.

This gets me really pissed at a lot of KS projects too. I just don't see a way that creating these kinds of objects dosen't lead to gaming toxicity. You will end up with the older players monopolizing all the special stuff and the newer players feeling like they can never catch up. Even if newer players can make new special stuff, for gamers who care about stats and such the older items will always be ""more special"" than anything they can make.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:16:03.000Z

"Honestly. I find this all a bit unimaginative. Even the most interesting idea, the idea that you have a unique item that grows with the world, could be done without a blockchain really. Sure.... The blockchain could allow you to trade that weapon between ""World"" I guess. That might be interesting. But as long as it only exist within the virtual world that created there is no real befit to it. If anything considering how blockchains work it would actually just make thing more resource intensive most likely.

Now that said. Blockchains could have some interesting uses. Maybe one could make a lean effective one that allows you to make a distributed MMO where you have no central server shard. Maybe not the most creative use ether. But if it could be done then we could really really talk about a free to play MMO. (Except of course you would have to be a part of the bookkeeping to keep thing running. But at least you now actually doing a service to a 3rd part outside the network like the example given with by EC with crypto mining) 

I like to see people actually use Blockchains for something useful rather then a way to turn computational power and energy in to pointless electronic currencies that have no real value. Wasting resource in the process that could be used for neat stuff like scientific research or playing awesome games ;)",0,0,2018-05-30T18:15:44.000Z

It's hard to tell. But, there is always this one big issue with blockchain. Every use adds data to the chain, and for things to be fair, every user needs a constantly updated copy of the chain. Or at least that's how bitcoin works. So those files can become quite heavy as such a game age. How is such a problem solved?

Would be funny to see a fishing rod and a wooden club being called something like that after it got the last hit in a raid boss or event boss. But, I digress.

I got the feeling most of the audience was just passively nodding along to not be impolite as we watched the pretty bleh gameplay happen while the team lead just went on and on about how the game would improve a part of your brain, and help your bitcoin wallet.

"i think its going to be amazing, sort of, we just need to find the perfect use for it or so.

a long lasting sword with a lot of buffs, sounds like it would fill the tooltip up too much, but you can cap it for different types of sword tiers so they dont get +infinate damage, but rather +50 or something reasonable as a cap. but then theres the problem of having high level swords floating around in the future of the game, so i guess you could debuff it so it loses effectiveness if it has not been used or is being used for different purposes so its only good for killing specific types of enemies and not all of them. and then theres the balancing of the first players to level up the swords, it would be hard for them and easy for future players, so having preleveled swords in existance could help.

There is a lot to think about with a game that can remember everything, there is so much to use it for, but not enough time to implement so what do you use it for in your game.

and i dont think future developers would call it block chain, but rather a memory system which remembers everything that has every happened in the game and dictates future events.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:10:24.000Z

"Firstly, none of the things you suggest are dependent on decentralisation, and as such, doesn't really benefit from  being on a blockchain. Unless it's completely decentralised, with anyone being able to run a node, as well as being mined by many different actors, you might as well just use a regular database. Doing so would be easier to manage (you can't really patch a decentralised blockchain, and coding them is a lot more complicated), and it would be way less power consuming, since it doesn't require mining. Also, all of the minor events happening in-game would have to be recorded on the blockchain, leading to either _very_ fast blockchain size growth (assuming uncapped blocksize) or _very_ high ""transaction"" fees (assuming capped), which would make the project unmangable, undistributable, unaffordable, or downright unplayable. Gaming is a terrible use-case for blockchain technology, case in point: cryptokitties, which for a couple of weeks brought the entire Ethereum network to its knees.

As for the second suggestion, to utilize mining programs in the background: great idea, which is why it has sort of been done already. Unfortunately, without the user's consent (google ""cryptojacking""). This has poisoned the well for background mining, and most antivirus software blocks anything containing a mining program as a result. You might want to simply obfuscate this to AV's by compiling it into the executable of your game, then? For starters, some AV's probably won't be fooled, and secondly, most of this software is GPLv3-licensed or similar, so it might be illegal to include it without open-sourcing your game. I think a free software game mining cypto in the background sound incredible, but good luck getting publishers on board. And again, people probably won't be too into something associated with cryptojacking.",41,0,2018-05-30T18:05:03.000Z

Or the top items are not going to have a lot of mobility -- unless you allow a boss to loot the item from the player and then drop it as a reward to someone who actually defeats it.)

Than Shadow of Mordor severely slow in-game progress towards the end unless you buy loot boxes. And then EA shits the bed with Battlefront II.

This ""gas"" is used to execute smart-contracts on the Ethereum blockchain not to make the Ethereum developers money, or even the game developers money, but to secure the protocol from spam attacks on the network as a whole!

"FANTASTIC ep. Best tech/game related one I've seen in a LONG time. Love the idea of using Block Chain for handed down/heirloom items building legends around by forging them with your own deeds thus becoming legends in their own right. That's really cool. The cryptoCoin mining free app/game however raises some concerns/red flags for me. Sounds WAAAAAAY too similar to a virus that infects turns machines into zombies (slave machines controlled and performing operations for other machines/programs without the user's knowledge or consent) for comfort. It also raises the question of are you giving consent to use of your machine/resources mining only while the game is played, installed, or indefinitely/in perpetuity, thus raising some major ethical questions, as you are essentially signing your machine into indentured servitude/slavery and thus resources/property over to them. Also what about possible long term effects of using those resource for it, such as resource/memory hogging & hardware degradation. Both VERY real and likely issues.",0,0,2018-05-30T17:50:58.000Z

"Dan talk aside... the case talked about here is not really a 'blockchain' thing any more than it would normally be a 'SQL thing' or 'Cassandra thing'.  The blockchain is being used, but the same game feature could be implemented just as easily, well, probably even more easily, via a traditional centralized server.

The big problem with trying to bring blockchain to games is it is currently a solution looking for problems, and I am not sure it is a solution that really brings anything to standard 'publisher->consumer' games.  Now, where it might really apply would be decentralized games, open source ones like old MUDs, or games with heavy player run server communities like minecraft.  Imagine bringing back something like TradeWars or a decentralized version of Pardus.

But any case where you have a single company controlling the game, a single holder of the private key for entering 'new stuff', blockchain just represents a trendy but less efficient implementation.",3,1,2018-05-30T17:47:09.000Z
