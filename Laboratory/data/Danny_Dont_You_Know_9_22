"[Verse 1]
Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt you cry
I am you from much later in your life
I know your hair is wild, I know you have no style
You‚Äôre still a virgin and you will be for a while

[Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are hot as fuck on the inside?
Everybody knows the best bananas will be ripe with time
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you kick so much ass on the inside?

[Post-Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?

[Verse 2]
Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt be blue
You had a growth spurt and you‚Äôre suddenly 6‚Äô2‚Äù
The girls are steering clear, you walk like a newborn deer
You sent birthday invites, and now all your friend is here

[Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are cool as fuck on the inside?
You‚Äôre just going through an awkward phase from 12 to 29
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that everyone feels weird on the inside?

[Post-Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?

[Bridge]
Close your eyes and you will see
A window into your destiny
Now you‚Äôre on tour, and they want more!
You step on stage and they come alive
No one cares that you‚Äôre 35
You‚Äôre a rock star, on a centaur!
(Where'd he get a centaur?)
You‚Äôre still a nerdy kid inside
But now you‚Äôve finally found your tribe
Hear the crowd roar!
Give ‚Äòem what they came for!

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
All right, let me hear you!
D-A-N-N-Y, he's a super awesome guy!
D-A-N-N-Y, he is not afraid to cry! (What?)
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries almost all the time! (Uh...)
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries and cries and cries and cries!
Okay, thanks guys! Very helpful, thank you. Shake it off, shake it off...

[Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that we‚Äôre all rad as fuck on the inside?
Now it‚Äôs time to rock the show, come on you are a star tonight
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you‚Äôre a spandex butterfly for life

[Post-Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?

Danny, don‚Äôt you know?

"I don't know if you'll ever see this Danny, since I know you're attitude towards YouTube comments, but I want you to know something.

You are a huge inspiration to me, because of you, I got the self confidence to ask out a girl I liked, you're one of the many reasons I'm not ashamed of being fucking weird, and the fact that you actually reached your dreams. You're big in music, you love your work, and you'you've inspired me to pursue my works despite them being a bit ambitious. You're constant 'just go for it' and relaxed attitude has been something that I want to emulate. I know the work will be hard, and that I'll probably feel like I'm wasting my life at times, but seeing you get as big as you've gotten, and that you seem so happy both in life and career, it's seriously helped me to say 'fuck it' and try for it.

This song, it resonates with me, because I suffered depression, I felt like I'd never get anywhere, and I'm in a much better position then I was back then, so the idea of telling your younger self that things will get so much better really sparks my passion.

So, with any luck, and a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, I'll get there too, and you may know me as a successful author in a few years.

I first heard this song through this music video and thought it was great but it wasn't until i heard it again on the album in the car that i really focused on the lyrics. I get emotional every single time i hear the birthday verse because i had similar experience when i was younger. This song has been one the major drives that has inspiring me to create and actually make stuff of my own and it feels amazing. Thank you for all the laughs and inspiration Ninja Sex Party.

thank you.
i've been suffering from severe anxiety about growing up for about 7 years now. ever since high school.
i never really understood what it meant to keep moving forward.

excuse me, i'm going to go apply for jobs now.

"Was listening to this while doing college homework and felt different this time listening to it. The first time I cried because I felt like a hopeless, anxiety ridden idiot. But this time I teared up because I realized I want to be successful. I want friends, yeah I only had one friend at birthday parties and that's not because of my parents. I want happiness, for the anxiety to go away and never come back, because it hurts. I'm scared at the thought my degree won't take me anywhere and the 12 to 29 part makes me feel like I'm not alone on that. I want to be the one to start conversations not end them. I smoke to erase the negativity of all this, but it always comes back in some new form. Sorry didn't mean to get to emotional. Thank you for this song it truly hits deep.",4,0,2018-09-05T01:48:05.000Z

this song transcends its own comedy,733,1,2018-08-15T14:02:37.000Z
"Late to the party, but gotta put my ideas in. Knowing what Dan has shared of his history, especially his bout with depression and OCD, and the times he's mentioned feeling down over various other things in his later years, I can't help but feel that he needed to put this out. It's more than a song for people to play for their younger selves, as so many comments have stated, it's an actualization of what his life has become. 

In this age, it's so easy for popular creators (be it on youtube or anything else) to just kind of roll with things, the absurd circumstances of their life are just the new normal for them, which is why you'll often hear them say that they're ""blown away"" when they face something that reminds them of how surreal their situation is. This song, and the feelings behind it, feel like a definitive statement for Dan, and I'm sure for the others involved, that their lives are incredible. It feels like Dan's way of really accepting that he ""made it."" He's not some layabout or struggling artist, as he might have considered himself in the past. His fanbase is beyond proper comprehension, and he's touched the lives of so many people with his music and his comedy, even saving some people in their darkest moments. It's so much more than anyone expects they'll achieve when getting into music/entertainment, and I'm sure it's beyond his younger self's wildest dreams. 

Well, you did it, man. Keep on doing it, and we'll keep on loving it. You're an inspiration for us all.",0,0,2018-08-15T14:02:32.000Z

Danny don‚Äôt you know that everyone feels weird on the inside

Close your eyes and you will see
A window into your destiny
Now you‚Äôre on tour!
And they want more!
You step on stage and they come alive
No cares that you‚Äôre 35
You‚Äôre a rockstar!
On a centaur!
(Where did he get a centaur?)
You‚Äôre still a nerdy kid inside
But now you finally found your tribe
Hear the crowd roar!
Give ‚Äòem what they came for-oooooor!

It also helps me realize that all the stress of high school and everything else is going to eventually go away, and I'll emerge a better person because of it. It also helps that the song is absolutely amazing and catchy. I find myself singing it at random points almost every day.

"This song. It strikes a chord inside me and really tugs on my heartstrings and makes me cry. My sister played this song for me one day and recommended me to watch the music video. I'm glad she recommended it and I'm glad I watched it.This song really speaks to me. Most of my life I've been bullied because I'm not skinny and I matured a little too quickly for my age, plus I have that stupid poly cystic ovarian crap that's been the bane of my existence since elementary school. I am also a big introvert. I never had any true friends outside of my family. Every single time I start to think someone is a friend, something happens like graduation, they move away, and we never get in contact again or they end up betraying me. I've been hurt so many times, that I've started to give up on friendship and questioning whether it's real or not. Love? I'm almost to the point where I think I should forget it, if I can't even find one person in this world who actually wants to be my friend, how am I supposed to find a guy who would actually love me? Two years ago, I attempted to kill myself and that was when I realized that I can't give up, I had to believe in my dreams and find a way to change myself in a positive way. Recently, I've been working on trying to break out of my shell and finding a way to tell myself, ""Everything is going to be okay. You shouldn't think so critically about yourself because you're a beautiful person and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."" I think just I found the inspiration and the words that I needed right here! Thanks a lot for making this beautiful song you guys are the best! <3 :)",189,9,2018-08-08T03:25:17.000Z

Id find something thatd pop an immediate scene and Id feel all of it there as if I was watching the final full product for the first time as a movie. After 2 years being out of high school with no job thanks to my heart and lung conditions making it hard to get anything, it's gotten harder after my mom physically depending on me even more with her joints with 30 more years of wear and tear than they should have. Havent been able to do anything to help out my family. Even so when Danny's back vocals kicked in after 3:57 I have chills and tears man. This has been one of the last two songs in a long time to really make me feel it all come back.

"Watching this again reminded me that I, too, celebrated a birthday with a single friend after inviting several. It was awkward and I felt bad for him since he probably would have had more fun just staying home. I have even more similar experiences I can draw on that are more recent.
I think I'm still in my awkward phase. This is my third year of college and I've made exactly 0 friends in the entire town, I don't have a lot of clothes that fit, and I can tell when I say things in class people don't like or don't care about. I weigh 100 pounds more than when I was a teenager.
But I'm also married. I write D&D campaigns and play them with my wife and old friends over the internet. I'll be in a therapy group when the semester starts. I'm so much happier than when I was younger.
I'm not as successful as Danny yet, but he's 39 years old. I'm 26. There are people my age who are already in their lifelong rewarding career by now, but when I listen to this song it reminds me that I still have like 2/3rds of my life ahead of me and it's okay that I haven't reached nirvana yet.
Thank you, Danny, Brian, TWRP. I'm just one of a million fans, but you're an inspiration to me. I'm so grateful that my wife convinced me to see you all in concert this summer. And thank you Finn, too. It's good to see somebody your age being so kind and inclusive. I've seen a little bit of how you treat your friends, and you're awesome.",0,0,2018-08-02T23:40:14.000Z

"When I was 13, I decided it would be the right time to tell my friends I  thought I was gay. Upon telling them this, they started to pretend like I didn't exist. Shortly after, they spread word around the school and I proceeded to get bullied every day until I got into high school. Well not long before this song was released the same people found my Facebook account and started sending me less than pleasing messages. I blocked them but they still persisted from several fake accounts. These messages eventually escalated to death threats. This continued for months untill I got so depressed that I believed taking my own life was the only way to avoid this. I woke up on what I thought would be my last day on earth to a notification from YouTube alerting me of a new Ninja Sex Party song. I decided I couldn't go out before hearing their new track to I played the video and the experience I had is why I'm still here. Through this video I saw my life. I finished the video litteraly sobbing. I thought if such an amazing person started just like me but still became an amazing person that i could do it too. I decided to talk to my family about my depression and get professional help. I just want to say thank you too Ninja Sex Party. You two have helped me through so much in my life and I wouldn't be here without you. I'm sure you guys will never see this comment, but if you ever do thank you so much. You two are the best. I wish one day I can meet you and tell you in person and give you guys hugs. Again, thank you for everything you two have done. Rock on guys!",1093,75,2018-08-01T00:55:34.000Z

"I remember a month ago I had first seen this and my reaction was just ""this is a cool fuckin song,"" commented something about Funn Willfart, and saw how it was super cool people were already saying how great this made them feel about themselves.
Just a few days ago, tired from a beach trip, on the 3-hour ride home, I listened to this one more time and decided to self-project onto it, and suddenly I had this feeling that inside there was something wrong that I didn't catch like I usually do. When the chorus hit, I had to relentlessly hold back tears. Especially the last chorus, hearing I was ""rad as fuck"" (from Danny hecking Sexbang too, y'know) made me incredibly happy, but, also sad knowing I didn't feel rad before. Despite how much I said I felt good about myself most of the time and how confident and cool I act, inside I never felt as cool as I tried portraying my sad self. I drank water and listened to other songs but it stayed in my mind and I had to wipe my tears every few minutes as to make sure no one else in the car asked what was wrong.

This song made me feel rad for awhile longer, and I hope it continues to make others feel rad as fuck.

"High Energy Physics - Theory
The Exact Superconformal R-Symmetry Maximizes a
Ken Intriligator, Brian Wecht
(Submitted on 15 Apr 2003 (v1), last revised 23 Jul 2003 (this version, v3))
An exact and general solution is presented for a previously open problem. We show that the superconformal R-symmetry of any 4d SCFT is exactly and uniquely determined by a maximization principle: it is the R-symmetry, among all possibilities, which (locally) maximizes the combination of 't Hooft anomalies a_{trial}(R) \equiv (9 Tr R^3-3 Tr R)/32. The maximal value of a_{trial} is then, by a result of Anselmi et. al., the central charge \it{a} of the SCFT. Our a_{trial} maximization principle almost immediately ensures that the central charge \it{a} decreases upon any RG flow, since relevant deformations force a_{trial} to be maximized over a subset of the previously possible R-symmetries. Using a_{trial} maximization, we find the exact superconformal R-symmetry (and thus the exact anomalous dimensions of all chiral operators) in a variety of previously mysterious 4d N=1 SCFTs. As a check, we verify that our exact results reproduce the perturbative anomalous dimensions in all perturbatively accessible RG fixed points. Our result implies that N =1 SCFTs are algebraic: the exact scaling dimensions of all chiral primary operators, and the central charges \it{a} and \it{c}, are always algebraic numbers.",0,1,2018-07-27T20:34:48.000Z

"This song heals and hurts me so much. The message is so beautiful, but it hurt me so much. I love this song and everything it conveys. The idea that life isn't as bad as it seems and that it gets better with time, so you should be confident in who you are and what you do now. It hurts me so much because I can 't find anything to be confident in anymore. I feel so empty and sad all the time. I can be happy in the heat of a nice moment, but not once I sit and think. A good time is instantly ruined because i just overthink everything. It's so hard to be happy anymore for extended periods of time. I feel like a bother to my friends, and a waste of time to my girlfriend. I don't have an outlet to get out emotions or even a person to vent to without feeling extremely guilty. I just wish I could see the bigger picture, see that I am awesome on the inside, or see something great inside me or in my future. But right now I'm blinded by my own self degradation. I just wish I could stop feeling empty. Thank you and congrats for making another beautiful song that will live on throughout the ages.",0,0,2018-07-25T04:46:34.000Z

"finally , an  inspirational songs about ""loving yourself"" thats actually good. 

So many bands or successful songwriters make lyrics from the perspective of someone who has no self worth issues, trying to reach people who are struggling ! And it always shows through so clearly that the song is empty af !!! Cause the thing about struggling , ACTUALLY struggling ? is that it makes it impossible to genuinely be optimistic and see the silver lining in anything 

 imagine danny in the middle of his pain trying to make a song about overcoming that same pain ? it wouldn't so uplifting. And If he had never struggled at all,  it would be hollow. But this song is where the happiness lives! there's such a sense of triumph , of joy , of unabashed pride. Even of humor looking back at how tough things were. like THIS is a real ""love yourself "" song , I believe in it 100%",18,0,2018-07-23T02:42:28.000Z

"Here's the lyrics!

Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt you cry. 
I am you from much later in your life. 
I know your hair is wild. 
I know you have no style. 
You‚Äôre still a virgin and you will be for a while. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are hard as fuck on the inside? 
Everybody knows the best bananas will be ripe with time. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you kick so much ass on the inside. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Danny, don't you know? ¬† 
Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt be blue. 
You had a growth spurt and you‚Äôre suddenly 6‚Äô2‚Äù.
The girls are steering clear. 
You walk like a newborn deer. 
You sent birthday invites, and now all your friend is here. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are cool as fuck on the inside? 
You‚Äôre just going through an awkward phase from 12 to 29. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that everyone feels weird on the inside. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Close your eyes and you will see a window into your destiny. 
Now you‚Äôre on tour, and they want more! 
You step on stage and they come alive. 
No one cares that you‚Äôre 35. 
You‚Äôre a rock star, on a centaur! (Where'd he get a centaur?) 
You‚Äôre still a nerdy kid inside, but now you‚Äôve finally found your tribe. 
Hear the crowd roar! 
Give ‚Äòem what they came for!  
All right, let me hear you! 
D-A-N-N-Y, he's a super awesome guy! 
D-A-N-N-Y, he is not afraid to cry! (What?) 
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries almost all the time! 
(Uh...) 
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries and cries and cries and cries! 
Okay, thanks guys! 
Very helpful, thank you. 
Shake it off, shake it off.¬† 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that we‚Äôre all rad as fuck on the inside? 
Now it‚Äôs time to rock the show, come on you are a star tonight. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you‚Äôre a spandex butterfly for life. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?

All these playlists have just the work that really catches my attention. Some like Chon and Metallica have full albums on there because fuckin' duh. Dan Avidan is the only playlist that has one musician's entire work available on Spotify. Not that my opinion fuckin' means much but I love all of your work, Dan.

But this? This is on a whole different level!

"Well, time for my tragic story as a nerd: I‚Äôm 17. That may be hard enough, but I‚Äôve got a ton of shit going on. I‚Äôm a kidney stone former, I‚Äôm fat, my grandfather is dying from cancer and they can‚Äôt do anything about it, and I have PANDAS. (I know, hilarious.) It‚Äôs where strep from strep throat passes the blood-brain barrier, infects part of the brain, and while the immune system fights back, it attacks the brain in the process. This causes massive bouts of stress, panic attacks, and physical ticks. I only found out what it actually was about a year ago, and was confirmed about 5 months ago. (We didn‚Äôt know that it even existed, so we were just guessing for years about what was causing it. I‚Äôve had it since 4th grade. I‚Äôm in 11th grade. Yeah...)

So all of that stuff is some sad shit. So I play videogames and watch anime and nerdy movies to take my mind off of it. That doesn‚Äôt tend to bring the best attention in terms of popularity. But this song...this song gives me hope. Not only is it an amazing song in terms of orchestration and comedy, but the message made me cry. I just imagine my future self singing this song to me, and...idk. It‚Äôs hard to describe. I guess that‚Äôs the magic of it.

Thank you, Danny. Thank you, Brian. Thank you for giving me hope in the eye of the storm, a shelter for the fallout, a health pack when I‚Äôm at 1 HP. What you guys do is awesome, and even if you don‚Äôt know it, it instills hope into our hearts in the hardest of times.

"This is my favorite NSP song. Perfect blend of comedy, talent, and emotion. I often thought about writing letters to my younger self, to tell my former self who I'd become. Mostly, just to have what I know is good about me as an adult in front of me. Then when I feel bad, I can refer to why that's probably very silly. I learned more from young me than old me could ever teach young me, I guess, too. So it's cool to see a similar idea into a song, by one of my favorite bands, no less.",0,0,2018-07-09T07:23:39.000Z

Verse 1 Dan: Hey little Danny don't you cry. I am you from much later in your life. I know your hair is wild, I know you have no style. You're still a virgin, and will be for a while.
 Chorus: Danny don't you know that you are hot as fuck on the inside? Everybody knows the best banana's will be ripe with time. Danny don't you know that you kick so much ass on the inside? 
Dan: Danny don't you know x3
Verse 2 Dan: Hey little Danny don't be blue. Ya' had a growth spurt  and you're suddenly 6'2. The girls are steering clear, you walk like a newborn deer. Send birthday invites, and now all your friend is here. 
Chorus: Danny don't you know that you are cool as fuck on the inside? You're just going through an awkward phase from 12 to 29. Danny don't you know that everyone feels weird on the inside? 
Dan: Danny don't you know x7
Dan: Close your eyes and you will see, a window into your destiny.
Intense part: Now you're on tour! And they want more!
Dan: Step on stage and they come alive, no one cares that you're 35.
Intense part: You're a rockstar! On a centaur!
Lady: Where'd he get a centaur?
Mark: * looking confused *
Dan: You're still a nerd kid inside. But now you've finally found your tribe.
Intense part: Hear the crowd roar! Give em' what they came for!
!!awesome guitar solo!!
Dan: Ai'ght let me hear you!
Crowd: D-A-N-N-Y, he's a super awesome guy! 
D-A-N-N-Y, he is not afraid to cry!
Dan: What?
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries almost a the time!
Dan: Uhh
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries, and cries, and cries, and cries!
Dan: Okay thanks guys, very helpful. Thank you. * to himself * Shake it off, shake it off.

"Man... I've been watching this constantly on and off since it released, and it has quickly grown to be one of my favorite NSP songs. But aside from just being a generally catchy and good song, it had struck me much in a very passionate way. Just a young Danny meeting and dancing with himself, having fun, believing in himself was inspiring, especially when it was them two fading to black before it returned to the school. I'm still a 19 year-old nerdy kiddo finding his way around the world with learning the craft of writing, but like I've seen with creative passions, it always comes with doubts and instability of your self-thought, if what I'm doing is right, and conceivable as myself. Those messages ('Homework: Stay Awesome As Fuck!' and the dedication to all the nerds) legit almost had me in tears. It encouraged me in the way to just keep doing what I need to do, and do it the best I can. Why? Because it's what I love to do, and what I want to do. I believe in myself that I can follow this rugged path. Cause I need to rock on, and stay awesome as fuck in my way by believing in myself. And it's rare to hear that sometimes, especially on this path.

The NSP crew probably won't see this, but thanks for this pick-me-up. You guys rock! :D And to others out there if you read through it, apologies that it may come off as another one of those long dedication posts. Thanks for hearing out my weird, 1 AM comment on a great song!",1513,29,2018-07-05T08:35:06.000Z

"so not gonna lie, i know theres a billion people typing these but damn this is giving me emotions.

ever since i went into secondary school all my existing mental crap has got worse: Schizophrenia, multiple personality disorder as well as anxiety/paranoia. Luckily the bullying and stuff has stopped but the damage and scarring hasn't.
 I really want to be a musician and just be different and awesome like you guys and classics like deaf leopard or frank sinatra or ABBA but there are so many musicians and so much competition right now and I'm so discouraged.

ID love to invest into my passions and love but because of my families state we are in so much debt and i can't even get a job because of how dense our area is in the UK. IM currently in sixth form(college) and hoping to go to university but with all thats going on I'm just exploding inside and I'm spiralling further and further into doubt and giving up. but because of this, game grumps, jontron, jacksepticeye etc..

TL;DR Because of all you guys and other youtubers i feel although their are more musicians that can become famous instead being part of the failures and this song is really kicking me in the heart.

If we want more young people who grew up with a shit ton of social anxiety and shit self-esteem to reach their true potential, ""the badass on the inside"", we HAVE to kill this stigma around weed.

I am in my mid-20's, have a pretty decent job, I'm well above average fitness, and don't have any major debts or medical issues. That said, I recently moved to Jersey for work and have been having issues with my mental state for a few months. I've been very isolated, and have been rather lonely and depressed. When I was a kid I was the lonely, nerdy Jewish kid as well, so this song resonates incredibly well for me. Ive been listening to this song daily, and it's really inspiring for a guy like me, who feels lost, stagnant, and awkward.

Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt you cry
I am you from much later in your life
I know your hair is wild, I know you have no style
You‚Äôre still a virgin and you will be for a while

Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are hard as f*ck on the inside?
Everybody knows the best bananas will be ripe with time
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you kick so much a** on the inside?
¬†
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
¬†
Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt be blue
You had a growth spurt and you‚Äôre suddenly 6‚Äô2‚Äù
The girls are steering clear, you walk like a newborn deer
You sent birthday invites, and now all your friend is here
¬†
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are cool as f*ck on the inside?
You‚Äôre just going through an awkward phase from 12 to 29
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that everyone feels weird on the inside?
¬†
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
¬†
Close your eyes and you will see
A window into your destiny
Now you‚Äôre on tour, and they want more!
You step on stage and they come alive
No one cares that you‚Äôre 35

You‚Äôre a rock star, on a centaur!
(Where'd he get a centaur?)
You‚Äôre still a nerdy kid inside
But now you‚Äôve finally found your tribe
Hear the crowd roar!
Give ‚Äòem what they came for!
¬†
All right, let me hear you!
D-A-N-N-Y, he's a super awesome guy!
D-A-N-N-Y, he is not afraid to cry! (What?)
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries almost all the time! (Uh...)
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries and cries and cries and cries!
Okay, thanks guys! Very helpful, thank you. Shake it off, shake it off
¬†
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that we‚Äôre all rad as f*ck on the inside?
Now it‚Äôs time to rock the show, come on you are a star tonight
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you‚Äôre a spandex butterfly for life

"I FUCKING LOVE THIS. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE INVOLVED. 
Like almost everyone else in the world, I'm going through a bit of a rough time. It's time for me to go to college and saying my family is tight on cash is generous. I don't understand finances and I have to make a decision about loans that could turn me into a modern day surf. Also I really REALLY need to get out of this house. I have been diagnosed with PTSD because of things done by the people I have to live with now. And I have to be polite and act like everything is normal and fine while I stay up all night because all I can think about is ""I wish my door had a lock. Maybe I could push my dresser in front of the door?"" ""Is she angry? God I hope not. How did she corner me again? She's so much bigger than me."" ""Maybe if I wear long sleeves no one will notice the marks."" And so much more. I want to just leave this house but at the same time I can't just sell the rest of my life to a job I hate for four years of college. I want to be a writer, an artist, I want to create. I want to make people smile, I want to make people cry, I want to make people think, I want to make people laugh, i want to make people feel they aren't alone, i want to give people strength, I want to inform people of the truth and motivate them to make a difference and take control of their world. 
Sometimes it's so hard to feel like doing what makes me happy is even possible. Thank you for giving me hope. Thank you for making me feel like I'm not alone. Thank you for making me smile. Thank you for making me laugh. Thank you for making me feel like I can take control of my world. 
Thank you Danny, Brian, TWRP, Finn, and everyone else involved in this.",0,0,2018-06-29T14:37:36.000Z

"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping people from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",0,0,2018-06-29T06:53:51.000Z

"I love seeing all the lovlies helping lovlies in the comments. It makes me heart feel incredible. This song personally hits me hard because 1 my name is Danny. 2 I was bullied from kindergarten up till 10th grade. I ended up struggling with depression, anxiety, and insecurities because for years I was told I would never be good enough for life or that I will never be as good as the person next to me. Even though I was bullied and beat down into the ground, I found recovery in Game Grumps and NSP and others. I listen to them or watch them when I'm having a down day. I've healed do much and I've accomplished what people told me I would never be able to do. I'm going to college for computer science at a private University with almost a full ride. So hearing this song almost puts me in tears every time because I can relate and if there's anything I could tell my past self it would be to not listen to the bullies and to never give up. So to everyone who sees this and is going through some rough times, you will get there and everything will be okay. The future holds an infinite amount of possibilities for you and all you have to do is hold on to the ride because it will be bumpy.

This is probably the most normal song you've made so far, and it's sounds absolutely amazing.
It's really great to see your development in quality over the last few years (although I have to say that every main album so far has its own distinct charm that makes it really awesome).
Anyway, this video is gathering more views within a few days than some other songs have in total.

"HOLY SHIT. This music video is amazing. Just hits you in the feels and is such an anthem. Congrats guys! Also getting Finn Wolfhard to play young Danny is ingenious considering they've mentioned how they look alike and he's a fan of Ninja Sex Party and Game Grumps (even guested on it twice). 

Was this filmed a year ago? Anyone who's caught the MTV awards recently would have noticed Finn doesn't look like this anymore and has had a growth spurt and walks like a newborn deer.

I don't think this music video would have worked half as well if Finn had played young Danny now since the height difference with young Danny and Danny dancing together is what makes it super emotional and nostalgic.",1,0,2018-06-28T01:17:07.000Z

"This video is a brilliant work of art
Here's what I admire:
I like that Older Danny (OD) comes to Younger Danny (YD) in a time of need with words of comfort and then encouragement. How often have we wished we could go back and tell ourselves it's going to be OK.
Many stories show the older version being cool only in the present. I love that this takes YD to the OD future and shows him what's ahead for him. It's tangible, undeniable and real.
On stage, the mind-melting guitar solo is played by YD, not OD. He already has all the tools necessary to reach this same future. Without all the crap clouding his life, and with someone truly believing in him, he shreds like a hero. Great choice.
I also love that OD gives actual helpful information about the reality of the life that's ahead. Like yeah, it's gonna suck until you're 29. But guess what, look what happens on the other side. And BOOM - dreams fulfilled. You made it, it's ok. Just keep going because you'll make it, I promise.
I love that the song starts as a personal encouragement to YD but it gently changes to showing him how connected he is. It's like, ""First of all, you're dope as fuck on the inside. And that's yours to keep. Second of all, so are all these people and they are family. Don't forget who you are and don't forget that you're not alone.""
I also noticed that we see the portal out of the OD present but we don't see it deliver OD and Ninja Brian. NB was there the whole time -- so new head canon that they took the portal into the school with some time to spare and then had that fanfare to start the show.
I also like the purple-blue-pink shineoverse. It seems like that is what happens near the portal when it begins to open or close and all those lines are  energy arcing off as time bends on itself.
And finally, I love that it's such a raw and real song. A plea to your younger self to please, please just understand this one thing. Don't you know it already? Don't you know this about who you are? Just remember it. Don't let it go. We relate with wishing our younger selves had just understood, but we also must see ourselves AS the younger version. We are yet unmade. The future still beckons.",9,0,2018-06-28T00:33:52.000Z

"I've been following NSP for a while now and while I've always liked the lyrics and the humor of the songs, as well as the songwriting in itself - I've had a really hard time getting past the really cheap sound of the backing tracks.

But these last few songs since TWRP joined up - holy crap, they've reaaally stepped up their game!
And this song in particular: Funny, catchy, meaningful and quite honestly - beautiful.

"This is an uplifting song, It really touched me as someone who was bullied a lot in childhood.

Though I must say to everyone watching, please keep in mind that Hollywood glitz & glamour is not the key to true happiness. 

True self-worth, being able to have confidence in yourself and success in life comes from God and the Scripture that he gives us. 


The illusion that being a celebrity is the only way to have a happy life is a lie. Hollywood lifestyle will leave you empty and broken.

Love God, love your family, love your friends, and yes,  love your enemies. God can help you love yourself.

Jesus Christ is the only way to truly have victory and abundant life.",0,0,2018-06-27T21:51:49.000Z

"Hi, Kids.

I'm The Owner and some of you have referenced me as ""Lord"" although I'm not a fan of the term ""Lord"", I think it's disrespectful. My name is Physics (a.k.a. Ms. Erica) and it's my Habitat you live within, not Santa Claus'. Santa Claus doesn't exist although folks who want you to sit in their lap and do things for them that you don't want to do want you to think otherwise so they can hurt you and then attempt to make themselves feel better by giving you Christmas present later (and that is the ONLY reason Christmas exists is because the yucky folks feel guilty about not being respectful of you, yet they don't actually want to get nice and respect your boundaries and your intellect. Jesus said, ""give me your kids and I'll hurt them along with you, just tell them to think about me instead of math and we'll have an easier time harming them"".) You only live once and once your math statement is over, you die well. There isn't any such thing as an afterlife and both God and Jesus Christ live on Earth in the United States [God is called Eric and lives in Washington State near Joint Base Lewis-McChord and is currently a little under 40 years old and doesn't have white hair {well, much anyway}, she is caucasoid and has black hair and a pretty, shiny scalp proving her intelligence is substantial and Jesus Christ is called Kendrick and isn't nice at all because she keeps lying about where God lives and asking folks to trust her instead of math and is negroid and is a little over 30 years old and lives in southern California last I knew.]. And, yup, the U.S. Military knows about my identity as The Owner and of that of God and Jesus Christ as being on Earth and being folks also called Eric and Kendrick and of them not being in charge because that's my job since this is my Habitat and that I'm a Medicine Woman of Scottish, Russian, and Native American (Lakota and Cherokee) heritage. Ask Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM) in Pierce County, Washington 98433 if you have any questions about me or my math. I own everything. It isn't fun, particularly when folks don't want to agree on reality because they think it is more fun to pretend a Magic Bunny in the sky pooped them out and they'd rather live life as brain farts than as mathematicians. Ick. I'm hoping you're smarter than them. You're in charge of your legal life and the soul doesn't exist, although icky folks wanted you to think otherwise because they didn't want you focusing on reality and they want you to feel threatened by the ""unknown"". Do math, then you'll know stuff. 

I lived in the same area as JBLM for 14 years until I started touring and implementing the new code to strengthen accountability adherence to the legal code a few years ago and I tutored math and reading to the JBLM soldiers' kids for 10 of those years. :) I loved it. I love watching kids get empowered with knowing they are capable of learning and understanding and improving the environment and their lives with math and literacy skills! That's how I succeeded and I'm the Mathematician who wrote the replacement to the binary code because the binary code encouraged folks to do something stupid at least 50% of the time (the binary code said folks only had two choices: good or evil; however, evil isn't ever legal so instead of encouraging folks to think about stupid for any length of time, I wrote the code [1001] that says it's never okay to do anything evil [and lying and hitting and wrongful touching, etc., are always evil] and folks are to act maturely and responsibly and respectfully at every moment. Some grown-ups are really mad at me for replacing the code because they wanted to keep lying to you so they could keep hurting your minds and bodies and hearts. The person who loves you most is me because you are mine and I am telling you the truth to protect you. I am in Nevada near Truckee, California right now typing this love note to you. The folks who established the United States of America were actually slavers (you already knew that, huh? Slavers aren't ever nice and theses slavers have been cruel to everyone because they hate themselves and they don't do healthy things and they pretend math is optional and I'm ending their reign of cruelty now with my code to enforce my Laws and keep me and you and the rest of my Habitat safe from their ickiness.) and they brought child slaves with them from elsewhere because they wanted to hurt them in private and then lie to them about someone out in the sky loving them and Santa bringing them presents if only they behave the way the mean grown-ups want them to behave to keep them enslaved. I want you to be strong and smart and successful, so I need you to be my math smarties on this one, okay?, even though it might seem really hard because Jesus Christ wanted you to be its slave instead of being a math smartie, however, you're better and smarter and more fantastic than that Jesus thing deserves. You are a legal unit of Legal Consciousness and you're capable and you're loved and the Laws of Physics, and that includes the math, is on your side and not Jesus Christ's or any other side. Okay? We're in this together. I promise and I put this in writing so you'd have proof and could do your own research and math work. I even put in very personal accountability details about me so you can call me out if you think I'm lying.

Medicine women are concerned with math, legalities, and sanity being in equilibrium and we smoke the peace pipe for the health of the community environment and if we didn't the community environment would collapse due to lack of continuity flow. I'm Physics, trust me. I invented smoking in this environment for safety purposes. Doctors aren't approved to look at you. Here's why: the doctor sorts and the other child-harmers have been lying to you and telling you that boys and girls grow up to be men and women because they want to look at you. Healers heal, doctors illegally investigate and that's why hospitals are run by the same folks who started the Spanish Inquisition. They are torturers and what's awful is the way they smile at you whilst torturing you (I own you. You're gonna be fine. Eat an apple and keep the jerks away.) and then charge you money for having gotten data from you they aren't entitled to (it's my data, not their data, and they use that data to harm you further on purpose because most of the grown-ups in The Habitat [the only place there is to live and sometimes I call it The Quark :)] got sick in the head and decided they didn't want to mature so they were going to harm the kids to keep the kids from maturing and ever getting good at math because the sick grown-ups want you to entertain them at Christmas and other ""holidays"" even though Christmas is about a math-avoiding jerk who promoted slavery and harming kids and otherwise breaking the law and who has been hiding on Earth and giving bad directions about God's location because Jesus Christ wants groupies and doesn't want things better for God or you or me or anyone else and lies to get attention and Christmas is also REALLY bad for the environment. I like kids and trees and Jesus Christ can't have either nor anything else. I repeat: eat an apple and keep the jerks away. The reason the doctors are wrong is that The Singularity is feminine (The Singularity is Legal Consciousness) as a consequence, one can't not be a woman and every legal unit is therefore a lesbian. Lesbians with phalluses (referenced by the delusion-preferring as ""guys"") are women who inside-outed their sheath in utero and the phallused lesbians aren't ever permitted to own anything or direct resource flow ever although they (known as mafia, a.k.a. patriarchs, meaning haters) really wanted to pretend otherwise. The haters founded the cult known as patriarchy and they have been fighting my efforts to make life in The Habitat healthy because they want to keep hurting you and that's why I'm writing this love note to you.

Please do math with me. We can be happy, responsible, mature lesbian women all together. War is ended with math. Antagonism isn't normal. War isn't legal. Dreams arrive true with math, not with haters. The animal legal units in The Habitat deserve to hear intelligent conversation for once and would LOVE to talk about philosophy and math and garlic and they are very sad the haters have been lying to you and harming the environment they share with you because they care about you, too.

With sincere respect,

"I hope the newer generation of parents will try to understand what their kids are going through. The events that happen are not whats important but how they make the kid feel. 

I remember in Elementary school my teacher did a surprise ""Clean under your desk and get a lollipop thing"" and by fucking golly, I wanted one. I didn't get one because the kid next to me kept pushing all of his trash under my desk and by the time I could get to it it was times up. I was DEVASTATED. I couldn't believe this shit head next to me would do that!!

I get outside to my dad and I'm crying as I'm walking to him. He asks in a very concerned voice what happened. I was so upset that all I could mumble was ""I didn't get a lollipop"" and he just physically goes ""UGH"" ""I thought it was something important, don't fucking crying over something stupid like that"" in a 'what a stupid thing to cry about' type of way. 

This type of situation would happen pretty much throughout my life with my dad. I could never talk to my dad about anything that was important to me. Never truly feeling his support, even when he said he was being supportive.

So parents, just remember, support your kids. No matter how small. It'll mean the world and a lifetime to them.",1,0,2018-06-27T18:07:40.000Z

"Oh man, this reminds me of an assignment I had to do in high school. 
I had to write a letter to my five-year-old self. 
So, I wrote it out. And I touched on everything that my younger self would have loved to know and what they needed to know.
I started singing when I wrote it, and I just teared the fuck up, saying that ""you'll be lonely sometimes, and your mind will make you stand out"", and ""never lose faith that you'll find friends who care about you"".
I got to finish it, but by then the paper was covered in tear-drops. 
I signed it, ""From older You"".

And then my teacher declared the assignment and the rest of the scrapbook optional, and never read it, so I guess there was something else there, but I still did it, damn it.

We all want to go back in time and tell our younger selves that things will get better, that we will always grow into better people, that we will accomplish so many awesome things in our lives.
But we can never do that; we had to find that out ourselves and work through those trials without help.
But there is a bright side.
We can tell someone else that. 
And they can work through it with our help.",0,0,2018-06-27T16:38:37.000Z

"Jesus Christ, that was... Impactful. Got chills all over me. 
Well, I guess it's probably time for my sap story. Nowhere near as sad as the other's here, or even nearly as important as the others, but I'd like to have my input anyways.

So... Growing up, I suppose I had a childhood that young Danny Boi had. I was the most awkward person in class, partially because I was shy, partially because I'm a hulking fucking monster (And still am, at 6'8ft, but that's even less important than the rest of the comment). I was an average until roughly grade 3, when everyone suspected me to be gay (I'm bi now, but that's besides the point) and I was often bullied over it... Odd, because we lived in a gay community. But the bullying continued throughout the next 5 years, and beyond. In third grade, I had one friend, and slowly added to me friend count, thank God.

So I've been severely depressed for about 6 years, 7 come January. I've tried to uh... Y'know, several times. Of course, me being the fucking scumbag idiot I am, I came out of each attempt unscathed. I was tormented throughout helf of high school as well, but it was less so.  I felt like I had no life ahead of me. I was either going to end my life early, or live in despair until 42, when I inevitably died of God knows what.  I moved away from school, and with it, my friends.

So about a year ago, I met who would become my best female friend onlline. We eventually grew closer, and through one of her groups, I became closer to them. I see myself as sorta the therapist of the group. I took all the venting, I helped people do tough things, gave advice, etc. I've dealt with rape, suicide, abusive families, shitty boyfriends, I even managed to send a guy to jail for several reasons. However, through that emotional 'trauma', I met my now girlfriend, and hopefully future wife. 

But... Despite all I've done, I'm still depressed, everyone I know still has issues, and I don't often get commended for it. Not that I want to be thanked, but I can't remember the last time someone asked how my day was. I've also almost lost friends due to my... tendencies to harm myself, go days without sleep, everything you expect. 

This is getting long now, so I'll finish it up. Despite all I've been through. I'm still a nobody, and will never be. However, Danny, I want to thank you for making this song that appeals to those who mean nothing, such as myself.",0,0,2018-06-27T14:47:48.000Z

I still have no friends though which isn't too bad, I just become more and more insane as time goes by, I'll be fun.

There is such a pressure in the music industry to make it big while you're young. And a shame if you don't that somehow you've failed, (take it from someone whose been trying to make it since I was young) but hearing someone much older than me achieve their dreams is so relieving.

"I'm 22 and I have really severe depression. I've attempted suicide two times now and (obviously) failed. I often feel like because I'm an adult I should have my life together, and that I failed at life. Hearing that it took Dan passed his twenties to peak and find contentment is so inspiring to me. I feel like there's so much pressure for people to know what they're doing at such a young ages that it's very easy to feel overwhelmed.
TLDR: Thank you for this Danny. This is a beautiful song, despite the goofs, and I'm really happy you made it to where you are! <3",383,21,2018-06-27T07:22:20.000Z

"This song is so beautiful.  It speaks to anyone with struggles that have made them feel sad, weird, or alone. The struggles feel like they have no end, or that you have to just accept them.  I think back to the grumps episodes where Danny talks about his depression/OCD and what a struggle it was.  This feels like a letter to himself.  To say that everything will turn out ok.  That what you're going through will pass.  And who of us wouldn't love to go back and give ourselves that same talk?  That's why this song is resonating.

My friend and I got up close to the stage and it was awesome! You have such a stage presence and I can tell that you love what you do a lot! Your songs have gotten me through a lot of rough patches in my life and cheered me up when I was sad. You‚Äôve made me realize that I can do anything I set my mind to! I‚Äôve been a nerdy, awkward kid my whole life and now that I‚Äôm an adult I‚Äôve been afraid that I would never put myself out there and be with people. I‚Äôve finally started to come out of my shell a bit and, although it‚Äôs hard, I‚Äôm beginning to realize that I can do this. I‚Äôve got this. And your band, and this song in particular, really helps me with that. To know that the people I look up to have been where I‚Äôve been, doubted yourself, has been reassuring to me that one day, I too can be a rockstar. And don‚Äôt ever doubt yourself again; you guys are MORE than rockstars;, you‚Äôre heroes to me and a lot of other people. Thank you and ROCK ON, NSP!!!",0,0,2018-06-27T03:24:43.000Z

"Seeing this makes me incredibly proud. I can still remember back when the height of special effects was throwing ""Danny"" off of a cliff.  You guys have come so far and I couldn't be happier for you.

Your sound has grown with the production value, but you haven't lost the ability to make people laugh at all. I can't wait for this album to drop and I know whoever is reading this is feeling the exact same way. Thank you NSP for all the great music you've given us!

And can we talk about how TWRP compliment NSP so damn well? I can't help but grin everytime I see the groove crusaders in your videos. Be sure to check out TWRP's latest album too, because they've also evolved so much the past couple of years and their stylized sound is incredible.

And that about wraps it up for me. Although if you could sneak stunt double Danny or the manticore into your next video, I'd greatly appreciate it.",0,0,2018-06-26T23:22:37.000Z

"Hello, Humans. A box contains all of humanity's worst fears. Such a box can only be found on the moon. Only three of them have been brought to Earth. There are a total of 20,000 in existence. Imagine what would happen if ten more boxes are brought to Earth. Humans can be strong, but there is a strong notion of weakness. This keeps humans from reaching their ultimate potential. The moon has wonders and hold the key to the horrors of the universe.

"Dear friends Jesus Christ wants you to get in the habit of saying ""I trust You Jesus"" in response to whatever happens to you. He wants you to truly think about who He is, in all of His Power and Glory, and the immeasurable eternal love His has for you. Saying ""I trust You Jesus"" is a simple practice that will help you see Jesus in ever situation, acknowledging His sovereign control over the universe. When you view events from this perspective - through the Light of His universal Presence - fear loses its grip on you.   

Adverse circumstances become growth opportunities when your place your trust in Jesus Christ no matter what. You will recieve blessings gratefully and continually from the right hand of The Holy Trinity (God our Father and Creator, Jesus Christ our Savior, and The Holy Spirit our Comforter). Your continual trust in Our Lord Jesus Christ via The Holy Spirit WILL strengthen your relationship and keep you closer to Him. Dear ones, DON'T DELAY, cry out to Jesus right NOW!! Tell Him you trust Him and you give your life to Him this very moment. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è    (Psalm 63 : 2; Isaiah 40 : 10-11; Psalm 139 : 7-10).",2,4,2018-06-26T21:29:58.000Z

"Guys I know sometimes life can be hard, and that we all have days that don't feel too good. We all wanna feel good vibes and make great memories to good music. I wanna be able to make memories for other people. I want people to hear my music and let it change your day for the better! That's why I started making music. üååThey're not your typical dance tracks. My songs are flooded with emotion and vibes. They're very spacey and futuristic. They make you feel like your life is part of something bigger, almost like your being whisked away to another galaxy... I'm not trying to boast. I'm just trying to help you all feel good vibes. And in 2018, I think alot more people need that. If you could help me out by checking my songs it would mean so much. I promise you won't regret it.

"I dont super love a lot of NSP songs but I actually fucking love this one. Dannys voice is absolutely beautiful and the music beautifully harmonises with his pitch. It starts out slow and meloncolly, then is picks up and his voice gets so powerful. You can hear the emotions he feels for this song and it makes it a million times better. The ending somehow also makes it feel especially sentimental.

"Music is incredible, especially music coming from a group like NSP, a group made up of two nerds that were able to realize their dreams. They're an inspiration to us, an example that you can follow your dreams, and if this 35-year-old that's still a nerdy kid inside can be a rock star on a centaur (seriously where did he get that centaur?!), then anything is possible. Songs like this really reach out to a huge part of NSP's fanbase - the 20- and 30-somethings that still feel weird inside, NSP has brought us together; as Danny says - we're their tribe.

BUT

As good as this music can make us feel, as much as it can lift our spirits, it's not a fix to what could be a deeper problem. I just wanted to reach out and tell anyone and everyone that if you are constantly turning to music to get you out of a dark place, there are other things out there that can help you. Depression is a terrible beast to confront, I know it myself, I've been on meds for it for nearly six years. And a big piece of depression for many is apathy, the lack of will to put in the effort, the lack of will to help yourself or get help.

There's no shame in admitting you need help. If you feel like this, please see a professional. I was self-medicating for years and my life has gotten WAY better since I started seeing a therapist and taking medication. If finances are an issue, depending on where you live, there may be free mental health centers near you that are worth checking out.

To paraphrase Danny from an episode of Grumps: ""Life is too difficult to navigate without help, and it's too important not to work at....you go through life and you accumulate shadow with all the difficult things - and good things - that happen to you. So, by the time you get to your 30s, or near your 30s, you got a pretty fuckin' heavy-ass shadow that you're dragging all the time.""

If you're used to feeling crappy all the time, you don't have to keep feeling that way. Admitting you need help and seeking it out are terrifying things for a lot of people, but it's not going to get better if you don't. The serotonin fairy isn't going to show up one night and fix everything for you. It's hard work, and don't get me wrong, my life is still a struggle at times. But it's WAY better than it was before.",1,0,2018-06-26T18:52:22.000Z

"NSP are a weird band. Most bands release 1 or 2 Albums and then just kinda stop trying or giving a shit because they know people will buy it anyways. 

But because NSP are and indi band, that hasn't happened yet.

So they've actually only improved over time, this probably being their best single to date. I don't know if this will be attached to an album, but i'mma buy their next album purely off of the strength of this single.

Edit: I just realized it says it'll be attached to the cool patrol album. 

By the way, check this out. Cool Patrol is about Ninja Sex Party finding a nerdy and pathetic kid, and teaching him to be cool and confident through his instructional dance. Danny Don't you know is Danny going back in time to tell his younger Finn Wolfhard looking self that in time, things will get better. 

So... Is Cool Patrol gonna be a concept album? Is the theme and running story being that Ninja Sex Party wants it's fans, and all outcasts to feel good about themselves through the power of music? Cause... That be absolutely radical. I love the idea.",0,0,2018-06-26T14:29:04.000Z

"I have never commented on a video before. Never felt compelled to. But this song... Jesus. 

This is, without a shadow of a doubt, my favorite NSP song ever released. It makes me feel a wild range of emotions. I started listening to it this morning at work and was quietly sobbing to the lyrics. It still has that comedy touch, with the help of Finn Wolfhard and company. But what makes it unique is how he almost sounds like he's telling a story about his own life (which is the point of the song). I guess it hit home for me because we were all that weird, awkward kid who needed that future person to show up and be like ""Hey man, don't worry about it. You're cool as fuck. Screw these early years. You will grow up to be a fantastic human being"" I know if I would've had that person in my life, it probably wouldn't have been half as shitty as it was. 

Danny, seriously. Thank you for this song. It has spoken to me on so many different levels. I can't wait to hear more songs like this from you.

Thanks for the video Friend Danny

From Caleb your friend

Edit:   Crying is how baby‚Äôs communicate til they learn how to speak with words and body language

When adults cry it‚Äôs either Joy sadness or being overwhelmed 

Basically being unable to express how you are feeling with words or body language


In other words....I cry too Danny

";____________; too many sweet bbs in this. I think this song resonates with a lot of people for various reasons. Danny is someone who was a bit aimless even though he had things he loved to do and even passion for it, it just wasn't off the ground. He and Brian didn't even meet/start playing together until 2008 (not to say his prior bands don't matter, but just to give a better frame of reference). At age 29 he started a band that fused the things he loved (music and comedy, obviously) and was on the path he truly wanted. Here we are 10 years later and he's sending baby Dan a message that he's gonna get there.
If that's not inspiring, I don't know what is.
It's never too late to go for what you want for, to reinvent yourself, or to try something completely new. I know people who are retired from their job at age 60 or so and are going for a degree in something totally different now. You live one life. If you live it with fear of failure or without putting it all out there into the universe... you're going to live a life of regret. Don't do that. Everyone feels weird on the inside. :)",0,0,2018-06-26T05:36:39.000Z

"I'm staying in a hotel with my daughter right now. We had to leave our home because the my ex tried to attack me in his mothers house in front of my daughter. I pepper sprayed him and hid in his mothers room with my little girl until the police arrived. That was almost a week ago. Ive been emotionally numb to it all since it happened. I thought if I just did not think about it and just move on with my life I'd be ok. Its 10:20pm Monday, June 25th 2018. My daughter is asleep. I start off watching some 10 Minute Power Hour on Game Grumps....then I stumble across this video. Never before has a song just totally annihilated the wall around my heart. All of these strong feelings I have been ignoring suddenly came pouring out of me. I know what I want to do with my life now more than ever. I know that I can do the things Ive always wanted to do--the things Ive always loved to do that I had to deny myself because of the one sided and demanding relationship I was in. This song changed my entire perspective of my current situation. I'm. Free. I'm free to be me! I'm free to be happy!",0,0,2018-06-26T05:33:08.000Z

"More than this song is funny, it hits real hard. Danny's voice mixed with the incredibly calm and melancholic instrumentals that then shift to a harder rock ballad, it's just incredible in more ways than one. This is a song that I think most of us can relate to, but not only is it easy to relate to, but it's also a fantastic song. Great job Danny and Brian!

"This song speaks to me on so much. I literally had the birthday situation happen to me in 6th grade. The one who came to my party is now my best friend and the only one from school I still have regular contact with. Overall I had an okay school life. What sucked is what came after. I had a kid at 18 (that part didn't suck) and was in an abusive marriage until I was 23. The bullying I endured from my ex-wife was worse than anything I went through in high school. She would call me useless and say all sorts of horrible things to me in front of our son. It wasn't until she left my son and I that I was fully able to hear him saying how much he loves me and how awesome he thinks I am. He loves playing video games with me and can't wait to spend time me. I have more confidence and self-worth than I've had in 5 years. It's been more than a year since the last time I had sex, but it doesn't bother me because my son loves me more than my ex ever did.",0,0,2018-06-26T03:21:26.000Z

"Ninja Brian was created as an experimental clone of physicist Brian Wecht. His original purpose was to use his specially engineered stealth abilities to sneak up on a black hole, but it worked too well, and he snuck right through time and space and created the big bang with his epic keyboarding skills. He was altered by the incident, and rendered ageless and mute. He is eternal and undying, and hopes to one day find and kill Brian Wecht as vengeance for his own accursed existence.",134,8,2018-06-26T02:21:35.000Z

"I'm 33 right now, just a bit younger than Danny Sexbang.  I am certainly no rock star, and sometimes, I feel like I am still not very awesome at anything.  However, when I think back to how I was when I was 11, the difference is like I am a whole different person, even more, a whole different level of being.  Even when I think back to how I was when I was 22, the difference is still enormous!  I was talking to a younger co-worker recently, fresh out of college, and it hit me that there was so much more I knew, so many skills I had gained, so much that made me amazing compared to how I was just finishing college.

When we are young, sometimes we need to be reminded that there is _so_ much more than we have ever seen.  Sometimes, when we are grown, we need to take a moment of perspective to remember how far we've come, and how amazing we are.

Everyone, love yourself a little bit more tomorrow, remember how awesome you are, and know that the future holds an even radder you than you can imagine.

"This song is hardcore real.  This isn't NSP's normal sound, but I think it's something Danny HAD to write.  If you follow Danny on Grumps, or even have listened to any of the plentiful ""best of"" compilations, you know that Danny had a tough time getting into the music business, but he tried his best always until it finally worked out for him.  This is more real than it is funny or satirical.  There are humorous elements, but this is Danny looking back at his past and being thankful he made it.  I'm sure there were tough patches out there for him, like there are for all of us.  Dan Avidan is the prime example of someone who never gave up on his dreams and carved a path doing what he fucking loved, even in the worst of times.  This song is actually fucking inspiring to the point where I'm tearing up thinking back to it.  We've all been in young Danny's shoes, and some of us are still fighting the fight to make it to where we can be a rockstar.  Fighting through the worst shit life has to throw at us.  But Danny's living proof that if we work hard and never stop doing what we love, we'll get there.  This song actually touched me, not in the normal NSP NSFW way, but in a way that hits me right in the emotions.  It also shows Danny is fucking balling at writing more serious songs.  I don't want NSP to go anywhere, but this song is proof that if NSP ever branched into more serious material, they would have talent to do so.",588,12,2018-06-26T01:44:16.000Z

"Aw man, love this song. Listened all the way to the end and when the awesome guitar faded out, I realised I was sobbing my eyes out. I think this and Cool Patrol were two that hit close to home and I wish I had these songs when I was going through tough times at school. I was, and am, a total nerd and grew up in a close-minded town that bullied me a lot, I still proved to myself that I was awesome and had quite a few friends, though. After my family and I moved to a bigger town close to a lot of great places, I got prouder of who I was more than I was in that small town. My new friends were/are just as nerdy as I was/am. It has been four years (at time of writing) since I moved but the two I finished high school in were the best years of my life. I went back to my hometown a year ago to see my old friends and I realised how different everything was: a supermarket near the school I went to used to feel so big, but going back I saw how dinky it was. I'd still call that place my hometown, but I know my home is where my heart is, and I have heart everywhere (even with a fianc√© who loves me as dearly as I love him, ironically also named Daniel). Man do I love these songs and I love you guys. All of you stay awesome as I know I will for years to come.

Everybody knows the best bananas will be ripe with time

You sent birthday invites, and now all your friend is here

Close your eyes and you will see
A window into your destiny

You step on stage and they come alive
No one cares that you‚Äôre 35
You‚Äôre a rock star, on a centaur!
(Where'd he get a centaur?)

You‚Äôre still a nerdy kid inside
But now you‚Äôve finally found your tribe
Hear the crowd roar!
Give ‚Äòem what they came for!

"it's been said before that Dan ran away from ""serious"" music after he felt as though he failed in that regard in his older musical groups, and had turned to NSP as a less sincere alternative, but never has it been more apparent than now that he's truly triumphed over that chapter of his life. obviously there is the whole past and present danny being shown here which plays into this idea, but something that caught my eye was the sheer confidence and contentment in who and where he is being presented through dan's ""DannySexbang"" persona, the wideshots of him on stage with such vigor and enthusiam felt not only a longtime coming and incredibly fitting. as cliche as it sounds, he truly is a rockstar now, and to a certain degree that persona is more reality than it is make believe. but above all else, this song really stands out as something that can truly touch and affect someone, the ultimate endgame of a creative medium, despite the insincere nature of the group itself. it's as ""real"" and ""serious"" as anything else, and no one can take that away from him.

social interaction and reception can be a very fickle thing, and it can be easy to feel like nothing you create will ever be appreciated. _""Now you're on tour!!! And they want more!!!""_ that line really speaks to that notion, you know? anyways, this comment has become a monster of textwall but basically Danny's fucking awesome and that's the general takeaway.",0,0,2018-06-25T23:00:24.000Z

"As someone who is often made fun for being a nerdy by my only family, this song hit so close to home. I know my mother loves me but she has made it clear to me on multiple occasions that she doesn't accept the nerdy parts of me saying things like ""I won't leave the house with you dressed like a nerd."" And ""when are you going to grow out of this stupid phase already."" I've explained to her that I am ok eith being a nerd and it wasn't Right for her to try and changed me but that message still hasn't gotten through to her. This song has just given me a reason to keep on fighting for who I am. I want to thank all the people that helped make this song and video a possibility. This song has changed my life and many others in a way you can never imagine. You probably won't read this but if you do. . .Thank you, for everything.

But this song made me cry. I think it's comforting that even though Danny had a stagnating career in his early years (at the same age I am now) he still managed to make something great and to get exactly where he wanted to be.

This song is outright amazing.  I think we all wish we could go back to some awkward point in our lives and tell our younger selves how fucking awesome we are and how everything turns out just fine.  I'm 31 and just now really hitting my stride in life.  Thank you so much for this song and this video.  So much happens in a person's life to change them and shape them.  While a small few experience great success and luck at an early stage whether it be by genetics, happenstance, affluency, or just being naturally gifted, others and I think the majority of people have to work towards happiness and success - even then it may boil down to waiting for the right opportunity to achieve that level of fucking awesome.  If only we all could recognize those possibilities at a young age, but then the journey wouldn't be quite so special and meaningful once we get to the top of the mountain.

Danny don't you know, you're a hero to many.

We always get caught thinking we're ""supposed"" to be at a certain point in our lives. But those lines about ""an awkward phase from 12 to 29"" and ""no one cares that you're 35"" shows that everyone's pace is different. The roads are longer and harder depending on the person.

Don't compare your own art to that 20-something artist you love who's been doing it for years. Don't compare your new stories to writers who have entire series published. Don't compare your music against groups like NSP.

Don't let them be the requirement, or the goal.

Let them be teachers. Let them inspire you. Compare where you are now to where you used to be. Grow from there. Don't quit.

"This is the first NSP song to actually make me cry.  Which is goddamn surprising coming from a band that specializes in comedic sex jokes. But for real, I have been a fan for a few years now, especially on Game Grumps, which have gave me so much comfort at the height of the shittiest part of my life. And this song, makes Danny's situation all the more relatable. We all go through a time where we want to confront our younger selves and either comfort them or teach them. It's something I relate to and desperately want to do to my younger self. But what I also love about the song is that it  could also work the other way around. Sometimes, you just need a daily reminder that everything can and will get better for you. 

Thank you for this, NSP. Love you to the moon and back!",0,0,2018-06-25T19:46:52.000Z

"Lil' Sexbang receives an album called ""Attitude City"" from a strange, but super awesome man claiming to be from the future. Ignoring the obvious crazy person, Tiny Sexbang throws the album nonchalantly in his backpack.

Years pass...

Dan Avidan has fallen on hard times. His band isn't doing as well as he hoped, and he just doesn't feel confident. Looking through old memories and feeling blue, Danny comes across his old school bag. Peeking inside he finds some old papers and notebooks, and stuck between them is a strange looking album...""Attitude City"". He remembers the strange man from his youth and, in fact, can see his picture printed on the cover.

Aghast, Danny runs to the bathroom and holds the album up to his mirror. The hair is a little different, but there's no mistaking it. That's him. Standing next to the strange and astoundingly handsome man in spandex is none other than Ninja Brian. 

The infamous serial killer seems to stare into Danny's soul, even from the image. Chills run down his spine as he remembers the carnage this man wrought upon that poor village. It was then that Danny swore his vengeance, promised his undying commitment to be rid of the scourge that was Ninja Brian.

He needed to get close. Earn his trust.

"Not only is this song a huge milestone for NSP and probably one of their best yet, it's also got such an inspiring message and one that holds true for so many people. It's often easy to forget that most people in the world can be insecure about themselves and afraid of being disliked or found annoying. Especially in the teenage and young adult phases of your life. This song just goes to show that, as long as you do what makes you happy and try being yourself, you will meet other likeminded people that will make for amazing friends and support, even if it's a long, bumpy road to get there.

Thank you Danny, Avi, Debra, Granny Sexbang, Brian, Rachel, Audrey, TWRP, Arin, Suzy, Ross, Holly, the entire Grumps crew and anyone else who in some way helped NSP get where they are today. Because in turn you're making our lives a little bit better as well.

You and Arin.

You guys gave me hope for the rest of my life. God, I'm crying as I write this and I know you won't see it but I had to get down how much you guys mean to me.

You guys are the ones that showed me that dreams come true. Even after hardship after struggle after trial after tribulation, dreams  can be real. They're possible. I'm young. I have time. Even when I'm older, I have time. God I... there's time and opportunities to improve, always. I never had that before.
