"[Verse 1]
Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt you cry
I am you from much later in your life
I know your hair is wild, I know you have no style
You‚Äôre still a virgin and you will be for a while

[Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are hot as fuck on the inside?
Everybody knows the best bananas will be ripe with time
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you kick so much ass on the inside?

[Post-Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?

[Verse 2]
Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt be blue
You had a growth spurt and you‚Äôre suddenly 6‚Äô2‚Äù
The girls are steering clear, you walk like a newborn deer
You sent birthday invites, and now all your friend is here

[Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are cool as fuck on the inside?
You‚Äôre just going through an awkward phase from 12 to 29
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that everyone feels weird on the inside?

[Post-Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?

[Bridge]
Close your eyes and you will see
A window into your destiny
Now you‚Äôre on tour, and they want more!
You step on stage and they come alive
No one cares that you‚Äôre 35
You‚Äôre a rock star, on a centaur!
(Where'd he get a centaur?)
You‚Äôre still a nerdy kid inside
But now you‚Äôve finally found your tribe
Hear the crowd roar!
Give ‚Äòem what they came for!

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
All right, let me hear you!
D-A-N-N-Y, he's a super awesome guy!
D-A-N-N-Y, he is not afraid to cry! (What?)
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries almost all the time! (Uh...)
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries and cries and cries and cries!
Okay, thanks guys! Very helpful, thank you. Shake it off, shake it off...

[Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that we‚Äôre all rad as fuck on the inside?
Now it‚Äôs time to rock the show, come on you are a star tonight
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you‚Äôre a spandex butterfly for life

[Post-Chorus]
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?

"I don't know if you'll ever see this Danny, since I know you're attitude towards YouTube comments, but I want you to know something.

You are a huge inspiration to me, because of you, I got the self confidence to ask out a girl I liked, you're one of the many reasons I'm not ashamed of being fucking weird, and the fact that you actually reached your dreams. You're big in music, you love your work, and you'you've inspired me to pursue my works despite them being a bit ambitious. You're constant 'just go for it' and relaxed attitude has been something that I want to emulate. I know the work will be hard, and that I'll probably feel like I'm wasting my life at times, but seeing you get as big as you've gotten, and that you seem so happy both in life and career, it's seriously helped me to say 'fuck it' and try for it.

This song, it resonates with me, because I suffered depression, I felt like I'd never get anywhere, and I'm in a much better position then I was back then, so the idea of telling your younger self that things will get so much better really sparks my passion.

So, with any luck, and a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, I'll get there too, and you may know me as a successful author in a few years.

I first heard this song through this music video and thought it was great but it wasn't until i heard it again on the album in the car that i really focused on the lyrics. I get emotional every single time i hear the birthday verse because i had similar experience when i was younger. This song has been one the major drives that has inspiring me to create and actually make stuff of my own and it feels amazing. Thank you for all the laughs and inspiration Ninja Sex Party.

"Was listening to this while doing college homework and felt different this time listening to it. The first time I cried because I felt like a hopeless, anxiety ridden idiot. But this time I teared up because I realized I want to be successful. I want friends, yeah I only had one friend at birthday parties and that's not because of my parents. I want happiness, for the anxiety to go away and never come back, because it hurts. I'm scared at the thought my degree won't take me anywhere and the 12 to 29 part makes me feel like I'm not alone on that. I want to be the one to start conversations not end them. I smoke to erase the negativity of all this, but it always comes back in some new form. Sorry didn't mean to get to emotional. Thank you for this song it truly hits deep.",4,0,2018-09-05T01:48:05.000Z

this song transcends its own comedy,721,1,2018-08-15T14:02:37.000Z
"Late to the party, but gotta put my ideas in. Knowing what Dan has shared of his history, especially his bout with depression and OCD, and the times he's mentioned feeling down over various other things in his later years, I can't help but feel that he needed to put this out. It's more than a song for people to play for their younger selves, as so many comments have stated, it's an actualization of what his life has become. 

In this age, it's so easy for popular creators (be it on youtube or anything else) to just kind of roll with things, the absurd circumstances of their life are just the new normal for them, which is why you'll often hear them say that they're ""blown away"" when they face something that reminds them of how surreal their situation is. This song, and the feelings behind it, feel like a definitive statement for Dan, and I'm sure for the others involved, that their lives are incredible. It feels like Dan's way of really accepting that he ""made it."" He's not some layabout or struggling artist, as he might have considered himself in the past. His fanbase is beyond proper comprehension, and he's touched the lives of so many people with his music and his comedy, even saving some people in their darkest moments. It's so much more than anyone expects they'll achieve when getting into music/entertainment, and I'm sure it's beyond his younger self's wildest dreams. 

Well, you did it, man. Keep on doing it, and we'll keep on loving it. You're an inspiration for us all.",0,0,2018-08-15T14:02:32.000Z

Danny don‚Äôt you know that everyone feels weird on the inside

Close your eyes and you will see
A window into your destiny
Now you‚Äôre on tour!
And they want more!
You step on stage and they come alive
No cares that you‚Äôre 35
You‚Äôre a rockstar!
On a centaur!
(Where did he get a centaur?)
You‚Äôre still a nerdy kid inside
But now you finally found your tribe
Hear the crowd roar!
Give ‚Äòem what they came for-oooooor!

"This song. It strikes a chord inside me and really tugs on my heartstrings and makes me cry. My sister played this song for me one day and recommended me to watch the music video. I'm glad she recommended it and I'm glad I watched it.This song really speaks to me. Most of my life I've been bullied because I'm not skinny and I matured a little too quickly for my age, plus I have that stupid poly cystic ovarian crap that's been the bane of my existence since elementary school. I am also a big introvert. I never had any true friends outside of my family. Every single time I start to think someone is a friend, something happens like graduation, they move away, and we never get in contact again or they end up betraying me. I've been hurt so many times, that I've started to give up on friendship and questioning whether it's real or not. Love? I'm almost to the point where I think I should forget it, if I can't even find one person in this world who actually wants to be my friend, how am I supposed to find a guy who would actually love me? Two years ago, I attempted to kill myself and that was when I realized that I can't give up, I had to believe in my dreams and find a way to change myself in a positive way. Recently, I've been working on trying to break out of my shell and finding a way to tell myself, ""Everything is going to be okay. You shouldn't think so critically about yourself because you're a beautiful person and don't let anyone tell you otherwise."" I think just I found the inspiration and the words that I needed right here! Thanks a lot for making this beautiful song you guys are the best! <3 :)",189,9,2018-08-08T03:25:17.000Z

Id find something thatd pop an immediate scene and Id feel all of it there as if I was watching the final full product for the first time as a movie. After 2 years being out of high school with no job thanks to my heart and lung conditions making it hard to get anything, it's gotten harder after my mom physically depending on me even more with her joints with 30 more years of wear and tear than they should have. Havent been able to do anything to help out my family. Even so when Danny's back vocals kicked in after 3:57 I have chills and tears man. This has been one of the last two songs in a long time to really make me feel it all come back.

"Watching this again reminded me that I, too, celebrated a birthday with a single friend after inviting several. It was awkward and I felt bad for him since he probably would have had more fun just staying home. I have even more similar experiences I can draw on that are more recent.
I think I'm still in my awkward phase. This is my third year of college and I've made exactly 0 friends in the entire town, I don't have a lot of clothes that fit, and I can tell when I say things in class people don't like or don't care about. I weigh 100 pounds more than when I was a teenager.
But I'm also married. I write D&D campaigns and play them with my wife and old friends over the internet. I'll be in a therapy group when the semester starts. I'm so much happier than when I was younger.
I'm not as successful as Danny yet, but he's 39 years old. I'm 26. There are people my age who are already in their lifelong rewarding career by now, but when I listen to this song it reminds me that I still have like 2/3rds of my life ahead of me and it's okay that I haven't reached nirvana yet.
Thank you, Danny, Brian, TWRP. I'm just one of a million fans, but you're an inspiration to me. I'm so grateful that my wife convinced me to see you all in concert this summer. And thank you Finn, too. It's good to see somebody your age being so kind and inclusive. I've seen a little bit of how you treat your friends, and you're awesome.",0,0,2018-08-02T23:40:14.000Z

"When I was 13, I decided it would be the right time to tell my friends I  thought I was gay. Upon telling them this, they started to pretend like I didn't exist. Shortly after, they spread word around the school and I proceeded to get bullied every day until I got into high school. Well not long before this song was released the same people found my Facebook account and started sending me less than pleasing messages. I blocked them but they still persisted from several fake accounts. These messages eventually escalated to death threats. This continued for months untill I got so depressed that I believed taking my own life was the only way to avoid this. I woke up on what I thought would be my last day on earth to a notification from YouTube alerting me of a new Ninja Sex Party song. I decided I couldn't go out before hearing their new track to I played the video and the experience I had is why I'm still here. Through this video I saw my life. I finished the video litteraly sobbing. I thought if such an amazing person started just like me but still became an amazing person that i could do it too. I decided to talk to my family about my depression and get professional help. I just want to say thank you too Ninja Sex Party. You two have helped me through so much in my life and I wouldn't be here without you. I'm sure you guys will never see this comment, but if you ever do thank you so much. You two are the best. I wish one day I can meet you and tell you in person and give you guys hugs. Again, thank you for everything you two have done. Rock on guys!",1093,75,2018-08-01T00:55:34.000Z

"I remember a month ago I had first seen this and my reaction was just ""this is a cool fuckin song,"" commented something about Funn Willfart, and saw how it was super cool people were already saying how great this made them feel about themselves.
Just a few days ago, tired from a beach trip, on the 3-hour ride home, I listened to this one more time and decided to self-project onto it, and suddenly I had this feeling that inside there was something wrong that I didn't catch like I usually do. When the chorus hit, I had to relentlessly hold back tears. Especially the last chorus, hearing I was ""rad as fuck"" (from Danny hecking Sexbang too, y'know) made me incredibly happy, but, also sad knowing I didn't feel rad before. Despite how much I said I felt good about myself most of the time and how confident and cool I act, inside I never felt as cool as I tried portraying my sad self. I drank water and listened to other songs but it stayed in my mind and I had to wipe my tears every few minutes as to make sure no one else in the car asked what was wrong.

This song made me feel rad for awhile longer, and I hope it continues to make others feel rad as fuck.

"High Energy Physics - Theory
The Exact Superconformal R-Symmetry Maximizes a
Ken Intriligator, Brian Wecht
(Submitted on 15 Apr 2003 (v1), last revised 23 Jul 2003 (this version, v3))
An exact and general solution is presented for a previously open problem. We show that the superconformal R-symmetry of any 4d SCFT is exactly and uniquely determined by a maximization principle: it is the R-symmetry, among all possibilities, which (locally) maximizes the combination of 't Hooft anomalies a_{trial}(R) \equiv (9 Tr R^3-3 Tr R)/32. The maximal value of a_{trial} is then, by a result of Anselmi et. al., the central charge \it{a} of the SCFT. Our a_{trial} maximization principle almost immediately ensures that the central charge \it{a} decreases upon any RG flow, since relevant deformations force a_{trial} to be maximized over a subset of the previously possible R-symmetries. Using a_{trial} maximization, we find the exact superconformal R-symmetry (and thus the exact anomalous dimensions of all chiral operators) in a variety of previously mysterious 4d N=1 SCFTs. As a check, we verify that our exact results reproduce the perturbative anomalous dimensions in all perturbatively accessible RG fixed points. Our result implies that N =1 SCFTs are algebraic: the exact scaling dimensions of all chiral primary operators, and the central charges \it{a} and \it{c}, are always algebraic numbers.",0,1,2018-07-27T20:34:48.000Z

"This song heals and hurts me so much. The message is so beautiful, but it hurt me so much. I love this song and everything it conveys. The idea that life isn't as bad as it seems and that it gets better with time, so you should be confident in who you are and what you do now. It hurts me so much because I can 't find anything to be confident in anymore. I feel so empty and sad all the time. I can be happy in the heat of a nice moment, but not once I sit and think. A good time is instantly ruined because i just overthink everything. It's so hard to be happy anymore for extended periods of time. I feel like a bother to my friends, and a waste of time to my girlfriend. I don't have an outlet to get out emotions or even a person to vent to without feeling extremely guilty. I just wish I could see the bigger picture, see that I am awesome on the inside, or see something great inside me or in my future. But right now I'm blinded by my own self degradation. I just wish I could stop feeling empty. Thank you and congrats for making another beautiful song that will live on throughout the ages.",0,0,2018-07-25T04:46:34.000Z

"finally , an  inspirational songs about ""loving yourself"" thats actually good. 

So many bands or successful songwriters make lyrics from the perspective of someone who has no self worth issues, trying to reach people who are struggling ! And it always shows through so clearly that the song is empty af !!! Cause the thing about struggling , ACTUALLY struggling ? is that it makes it impossible to genuinely be optimistic and see the silver lining in anything 

 imagine danny in the middle of his pain trying to make a song about overcoming that same pain ? it wouldn't so uplifting. And If he had never struggled at all,  it would be hollow. But this song is where the happiness lives! there's such a sense of triumph , of joy , of unabashed pride. Even of humor looking back at how tough things were. like THIS is a real ""love yourself "" song , I believe in it 100%",18,0,2018-07-23T02:42:28.000Z

"Here's the lyrics!

Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt you cry. 
I am you from much later in your life. 
I know your hair is wild. 
I know you have no style. 
You‚Äôre still a virgin and you will be for a while. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are hard as fuck on the inside? 
Everybody knows the best bananas will be ripe with time. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you kick so much ass on the inside. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Danny, don't you know? ¬† 
Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt be blue. 
You had a growth spurt and you‚Äôre suddenly 6‚Äô2‚Äù.
The girls are steering clear. 
You walk like a newborn deer. 
You sent birthday invites, and now all your friend is here. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are cool as fuck on the inside? 
You‚Äôre just going through an awkward phase from 12 to 29. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that everyone feels weird on the inside. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Danny, don't you know? 
Close your eyes and you will see a window into your destiny. 
Now you‚Äôre on tour, and they want more! 
You step on stage and they come alive. 
No one cares that you‚Äôre 35. 
You‚Äôre a rock star, on a centaur! (Where'd he get a centaur?) 
You‚Äôre still a nerdy kid inside, but now you‚Äôve finally found your tribe. 
Hear the crowd roar! 
Give ‚Äòem what they came for!  
All right, let me hear you! 
D-A-N-N-Y, he's a super awesome guy! 
D-A-N-N-Y, he is not afraid to cry! (What?) 
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries almost all the time! 
(Uh...) 
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries and cries and cries and cries! 
Okay, thanks guys! 
Very helpful, thank you. 
Shake it off, shake it off.¬† 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that we‚Äôre all rad as fuck on the inside? 
Now it‚Äôs time to rock the show, come on you are a star tonight. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you‚Äôre a spandex butterfly for life. 
Danny, don‚Äôt you know? 
Danny, don't you know?

All these playlists have just the work that really catches my attention. Some like Chon and Metallica have full albums on there because fuckin' duh. Dan Avidan is the only playlist that has one musician's entire work available on Spotify. Not that my opinion fuckin' means much but I love all of your work, Dan.

But this? This is on a whole different level!

"Well, time for my tragic story as a nerd: I‚Äôm 17. That may be hard enough, but I‚Äôve got a ton of shit going on. I‚Äôm a kidney stone former, I‚Äôm fat, my grandfather is dying from cancer and they can‚Äôt do anything about it, and I have PANDAS. (I know, hilarious.) It‚Äôs where strep from strep throat passes the blood-brain barrier, infects part of the brain, and while the immune system fights back, it attacks the brain in the process. This causes massive bouts of stress, panic attacks, and physical ticks. I only found out what it actually was about a year ago, and was confirmed about 5 months ago. (We didn‚Äôt know that it even existed, so we were just guessing for years about what was causing it. I‚Äôve had it since 4th grade. I‚Äôm in 11th grade. Yeah...)

So all of that stuff is some sad shit. So I play videogames and watch anime and nerdy movies to take my mind off of it. That doesn‚Äôt tend to bring the best attention in terms of popularity. But this song...this song gives me hope. Not only is it an amazing song in terms of orchestration and comedy, but the message made me cry. I just imagine my future self singing this song to me, and...idk. It‚Äôs hard to describe. I guess that‚Äôs the magic of it.

Thank you, Danny. Thank you, Brian. Thank you for giving me hope in the eye of the storm, a shelter for the fallout, a health pack when I‚Äôm at 1 HP. What you guys do is awesome, and even if you don‚Äôt know it, it instills hope into our hearts in the hardest of times.

I learned more from young me than old me could ever teach young me, I guess, too. So it's cool to see a similar idea into a song, by one of my favorite bands, no less.",0,0,2018-07-09T07:23:39.000Z

Verse 1 Dan: Hey little Danny don't you cry. I am you from much later in your life. I know your hair is wild, I know you have no style. You're still a virgin, and will be for a while.
 Chorus: Danny don't you know that you are hot as fuck on the inside? Everybody knows the best banana's will be ripe with time. Danny don't you know that you kick so much ass on the inside? 
Dan: Danny don't you know x3
Verse 2 Dan: Hey little Danny don't be blue. Ya' had a growth spurt  and you're suddenly 6'2. The girls are steering clear, you walk like a newborn deer. Send birthday invites, and now all your friend is here. 
Chorus: Danny don't you know that you are cool as fuck on the inside? You're just going through an awkward phase from 12 to 29. Danny don't you know that everyone feels weird on the inside? 
Dan: Danny don't you know x7
Dan: Close your eyes and you will see, a window into your destiny.
Intense part: Now you're on tour! And they want more!
Dan: Step on stage and they come alive, no one cares that you're 35.
Intense part: You're a rockstar! On a centaur!
Lady: Where'd he get a centaur?
Mark: * looking confused *
Dan: You're still a nerd kid inside. But now you've finally found your tribe.
Intense part: Hear the crowd roar! Give em' what they came for!
!!awesome guitar solo!!
Dan: Ai'ght let me hear you!
Crowd: D-A-N-N-Y, he's a super awesome guy! 
D-A-N-N-Y, he is not afraid to cry!
Dan: What?
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries almost a the time!
Dan: Uhh
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries, and cries, and cries, and cries!
Dan: Okay thanks guys, very helpful. Thank you. * to himself * Shake it off, shake it off.

"Man... I've been watching this constantly on and off since it released, and it has quickly grown to be one of my favorite NSP songs. But aside from just being a generally catchy and good song, it had struck me much in a very passionate way. Just a young Danny meeting and dancing with himself, having fun, believing in himself was inspiring, especially when it was them two fading to black before it returned to the school. I'm still a 19 year-old nerdy kiddo finding his way around the world with learning the craft of writing, but like I've seen with creative passions, it always comes with doubts and instability of your self-thought, if what I'm doing is right, and conceivable as myself. Those messages ('Homework: Stay Awesome As Fuck!' and the dedication to all the nerds) legit almost had me in tears. It encouraged me in the way to just keep doing what I need to do, and do it the best I can. Why? Because it's what I love to do, and what I want to do. I believe in myself that I can follow this rugged path. Cause I need to rock on, and stay awesome as fuck in my way by believing in myself. And it's rare to hear that sometimes, especially on this path.

The NSP crew probably won't see this, but thanks for this pick-me-up. You guys rock! :D And to others out there if you read through it, apologies that it may come off as another one of those long dedication posts. Thanks for hearing out my weird, 1 AM comment on a great song!",1513,29,2018-07-05T08:35:06.000Z

"so not gonna lie, i know theres a billion people typing these but damn this is giving me emotions.

ever since i went into secondary school all my existing mental crap has got worse: Schizophrenia, multiple personality disorder as well as anxiety/paranoia. Luckily the bullying and stuff has stopped but the damage and scarring hasn't.
 I really want to be a musician and just be different and awesome like you guys and classics like deaf leopard or frank sinatra or ABBA but there are so many musicians and so much competition right now and I'm so discouraged.

ID love to invest into my passions and love but because of my families state we are in so much debt and i can't even get a job because of how dense our area is in the UK. IM currently in sixth form(college) and hoping to go to university but with all thats going on I'm just exploding inside and I'm spiralling further and further into doubt and giving up. but because of this, game grumps, jontron, jacksepticeye etc..

TL;DR Because of all you guys and other youtubers i feel although their are more musicians that can become famous instead being part of the failures and this song is really kicking me in the heart.

Imma take your word on it that you might be repelled by it now, but you have to admit it was a necessary part of your growth and weed does wonders for people with dormant creative talents. If we want more young people who grew up with a shit ton of social anxiety and shit self-esteem to reach their true potential, ""the badass on the inside"", we HAVE to kill this stigma around weed.

Thank you so much for making this song for your fans as it means a lot to all of us.",4,0,2018-07-03T02:21:32.000Z

I am in my mid-20's, have a pretty decent job, I'm well above average fitness, and don't have any major debts or medical issues. That said, I recently moved to Jersey for work and have been having issues with my mental state for a few months. I've been very isolated, and have been rather lonely and depressed. When I was a kid I was the lonely, nerdy Jewish kid as well, so this song resonates incredibly well for me. Ive been listening to this song daily, and it's really inspiring for a guy like me, who feels lost, stagnant, and awkward. 

TLDR, You guys kick ass, please keep doing what you do. Thank you.",168,7,2018-07-01T23:07:04.000Z

Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt you cry
I am you from much later in your life
I know your hair is wild, I know you have no style
You‚Äôre still a virgin and you will be for a while

Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are hard as f*ck on the inside?
Everybody knows the best bananas will be ripe with time
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you kick so much a** on the inside?
¬†
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
¬†
Hey little Danny, don‚Äôt be blue
You had a growth spurt and you‚Äôre suddenly 6‚Äô2‚Äù
The girls are steering clear, you walk like a newborn deer
You sent birthday invites, and now all your friend is here
¬†
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you are cool as f*ck on the inside?
You‚Äôre just going through an awkward phase from 12 to 29
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that everyone feels weird on the inside?
¬†
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don‚Äôt you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
Danny, don't you know?
¬†
Close your eyes and you will see
A window into your destiny
Now you‚Äôre on tour, and they want more!
You step on stage and they come alive
No one cares that you‚Äôre 35

You‚Äôre a rock star, on a centaur!
(Where'd he get a centaur?)
You‚Äôre still a nerdy kid inside
But now you‚Äôve finally found your tribe
Hear the crowd roar!
Give ‚Äòem what they came for!
¬†
All right, let me hear you!
D-A-N-N-Y, he's a super awesome guy!
D-A-N-N-Y, he is not afraid to cry! (What?)
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries almost all the time! (Uh...)
D-A-N-N-Y, he cries and cries and cries and cries!
Okay, thanks guys! Very helpful, thank you. Shake it off, shake it off
¬†
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that we‚Äôre all rad as f*ck on the inside?
Now it‚Äôs time to rock the show, come on you are a star tonight
Danny, don‚Äôt you know that you‚Äôre a spandex butterfly for life

"I FUCKING LOVE THIS. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE INVOLVED. 
Like almost everyone else in the world, I'm going through a bit of a rough time. It's time for me to go to college and saying my family is tight on cash is generous. I don't understand finances and I have to make a decision about loans that could turn me into a modern day surf. Also I really REALLY need to get out of this house. I have been diagnosed with PTSD because of things done by the people I have to live with now. And I have to be polite and act like everything is normal and fine while I stay up all night because all I can think about is ""I wish my door had a lock. Maybe I could push my dresser in front of the door?"" ""Is she angry? God I hope not. How did she corner me again? She's so much bigger than me."" ""Maybe if I wear long sleeves no one will notice the marks."" And so much more. I want to just leave this house but at the same time I can't just sell the rest of my life to a job I hate for four years of college. I want to be a writer, an artist, I want to create. I want to make people smile, I want to make people cry, I want to make people think, I want to make people laugh, i want to make people feel they aren't alone, i want to give people strength, I want to inform people of the truth and motivate them to make a difference and take control of their world. 
Sometimes it's so hard to feel like doing what makes me happy is even possible. Thank you for giving me hope. Thank you for making me feel like I'm not alone. Thank you for making me smile. Thank you for making me laugh. Thank you for making me feel like I can take control of my world. 
Thank you Danny, Brian, TWRP, Finn, and everyone else involved in this.",0,0,2018-06-29T14:37:36.000Z

"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping people from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.",0,0,2018-06-29T06:53:51.000Z

"I love seeing all the lovlies helping lovlies in the comments. It makes me heart feel incredible. This song personally hits me hard because 1 my name is Danny. 2 I was bullied from kindergarten up till 10th grade. I ended up struggling with depression, anxiety, and insecurities because for years I was told I would never be good enough for life or that I will never be as good as the person next to me. Even though I was bullied and beat down into the ground, I found recovery in Game Grumps and NSP and others. I listen to them or watch them when I'm having a down day. I've healed do much and I've accomplished what people told me I would never be able to do. I'm going to college for computer science at a private University with almost a full ride. So hearing this song almost puts me in tears every time because I can relate and if there's anything I could tell my past self it would be to not listen to the bullies and to never give up. So to everyone who sees this and is going through some rough times, you will get there and everything will be okay. The future holds an infinite amount of possibilities for you and all you have to do is hold on to the ride because it will be bumpy.

This is probably the most normal song you've made so far, and it's sounds absolutely amazing.
It's really great to see your development in quality over the last few years (although I have to say that every main album so far has its own distinct charm that makes it really awesome).
