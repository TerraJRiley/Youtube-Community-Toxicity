"Scott. Obviously Jack Kirby was inspired by the design of the 30's pulp hero Spider costume when designing the Ben Cooper Spider-Man costume in the 50's, which in turn inspired Steve Ditko in the 60's, and since Ben Cooper didn't want to admit ripping off their costume in the first place, they agreed to produce the Marvel Spider-Man costume instead of putting Marvel to task for ripping off their rip-off.

"I use to work at Saban too during that time, and the guy that said ""Previously, on X-Men"" was a regular guy that worked at Saban too. I believe his name was Scott. Nice radio voice, but he never did anything past the intro for X-Men. Saban was a really fun place to work at during the early 1990's into the 2000's, but¬†the company¬†was a bit unorganized early on in the early 90's because they didn't have an in-house animation department to store some of the animation cells they had laying around in the mailroom. And because of that, I ended up with a lot of the animation cells from that X-Men¬†title sequence, which I eventually sold for a few thousand bucks. I was already a big fan of the X-Men comics, so when they told me that it was okay to keep several mail¬†bins worth of X-Men animated cells, I gladly jumped on the opportunity. Even now, I still have some left over, but I haven't decided to sell them or not...

"I feel like Pete's understanding of his responsibility has evolved a lot throughout the comics. Gwen Stacy's death isn't simply another tragedy on Pete's conscience; it represents the death of any possibility of Pete having a normal life. It used to be that Pete hid his identity because he did't want Spider-man in his normal life, but he learned that that was impossible. The only reason Pete's life is in shambles is he tries to keep having some kind of normal life instead of pulling a Steve Rogers and going all in on the hero. After Gwen Stacy, the point of having a normal life becomes a question. While his secret identity is meant to protect his loved ones, he doesn't have to be too invested. That is, not until he and MJ actually become serious. Over time Spidey realizes that he needs MJ in his life and can't be as good of a spider-man without her which points to the big reason Pete has to have a personal life. It reminds him that each person he saves is the world to someone else and it also gives him the strength he needs to push on. When Pete tries to merge his two worlds in the lead up to civil war, it seems to go well until he realizes what it costs him to protect his loved ones without maintaining a secret identity. While One More Day is maligned (wrongly so in my opinion. The arc is good, but the consequences are executed poorly in Brand New Day), it was inevitable that Pete was somehow going to find a way to restore his secret identity. I have always love how Pete seems to get as frustrated as I do when he can't have a better personal life, but that he gets more and more used to it over time as he realizes that its a necessary cost of being spider-man and there is no way around it.",0,0,2018-09-24T13:14:35.000Z,Chris Kiser,UCq1pCjatWsAZ9EGwv5Tecnw,jB7uF2jIixA,True,UgwRAXwBmrReOhZ2Q594AaABAg
