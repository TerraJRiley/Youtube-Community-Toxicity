"Not gonna lie, everything you described sounds amazing. I don't even mean that ironically: I love dark, disturbing mindfucky plots, I love watching unlikeable characters, and I'm not squeamish about graphic violence or sex so long as it's used to actually be impactful (as opposed to tossed in just for schlocky shock value) - I'm going to check this movie out, and as long as it's not poorly done, I'm probably going to love it!

"For me, when Annie is tearing through that old box and pulls out the baby blanket the grandmother made and it says in BIG letters ""Charles"", that was the clincher for me. I was already feeling the transgender thematic elements, but that to me seems a purposeful nod of intention on the director's part. When I saw that, my mind boggled with questions. ""Oh shit! Was Charlie AMAB?"" and ""Could they're be an intersex element?"", since hermaphroditic traits became heavily demonized with the development of medieval Christianity in Europe. Illuminated and woodcut devils were routinely given mixed sex characteristics along with hybridized bestial elements. Also the Baphomet, obviously. Also intersex disorders often are actually hereditary.

But by the end, this seems to be an FTM story to me. I've heard most people describe the finale as a downer ending, but I just felt transfixed by the eerie haunting beauty of the dream-like ritual and psycho-supernatural elements and more importantly a weird sense of elation that I didn't understand at first. ""Maybe it's just relief that the torture for these characters is over"", but it was really the comforting cooing words of the Joan character that just sealed things in a nice warm envelope for me.

Within a thematic trans narrative, Joan is the liberal family friend validating and reaffirming an empowering identity for Peter. When Peter ""was"" Charlie, he was a very lonely isolated awkward child. It is his mother who never lets him forget that past, her forcing him to take Charlie with him to the party could be representative of her criticizing or outright invalidating his gender expression. ""I can see that thing you wear to bind your chest, don't you think you should change into a thicker shirt?"" Something nasty like that just puts his headspace back into that unaccepted weirdo kid he felt like.

Peter just wants a normal life as a teenage boy, he wants to get close to a girl and experience that part of his sexual awakening, but while at that party he has those insecure thoughts. He starts to feel anxious as if people see right through him, right to that little ""girl"" he feels hopelessly chained to, dragging ""her"" behind him.

Through the events of the film, were see the progression of Peter's identity and development of his psyche. Charlie is his Id, through ""her"" constant chocolate eating and disregard for socializing, motivated only by a deep and mysterious inner feeling. Peter is his own Ego and core, perhaps not perfect but to call him selfish would be unfair, especially when contrasted with his mother who has to have everything on her terms only.

Thus Paimon could be seen as the Superego, the higher self that Peter is on the path to becoming. Paimon is a beloved and adored demon god, he may not be accepted by wider society, but to the witches he is a supernatural wonder and source of joy and even prosperity and wealth. Paimon may have once had the face of a maiden, but he is now in his proper bodily form that accords with his true nature.

With the beheadings of his maternal grandmother, mother, and female child form, the matrilineal branch of his heritage is disconnected from his identity. He transcends the expectation of playing a role as a supporting female witch in a crone-mother-daughter goddess triad. He is a singular deity, a god and a devil and a prince, all at once.

Sooo yeah, actually a pretty happy ending! Sorta.",0,0,2018-09-23T13:07:41.000Z,Kasey,UCjRIgLSvOWw6fRzIOlqYFHw,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgxrscSXO8zoa_ELIRt4AaABAg

"Review a simple favor. It slaps hard and is more than the big names you'll recognize in it. While Kendrick is just sticking to her usual archetype, Blake's character is actual queen like holy shit. One of her best performances I've ever seen period. I was never a hardcore fan of her until now but she was easily the best part of the entire film. Before this, I knew about her from gossip girl obviously but I never watched much of the show nor do I remember any impressive performances since I didn't pay attention to that stuff when I was exposed to it, so I never thought she was bad either. This is the movie that won me over for lively and I'm proud. I think it blends comedy and mystery thriller very nicely and doesn't come off as formulaic where the genres blend. It does the comedy mostly through jokes but the jokes could be just about anything from a climax from buildup to kicking off the buildup. The structure of the scenes is made interesting this way and the flashback moments are used very effectively too. Especially during that confession scene where Anna is talking about how she fucked her brother.",0,0,2018-09-23T03:50:36.000Z,Peanut Butter Pikachu,UCm7KsQARvR_TQti7kCVIPJg,isjiybsY5Us,True,UgxnyCLr9bsBbfp7Y4R4AaABAg

"....Okay. So I get what Eraserhead is as a piece of art. I believe that David Lynch's feelings are valid and it's valid for him to want to express them, as well. 

But as someone who has been disabled from childhood, after hearing the background of the movie's production, I can't get over the thought, ""What if this is how my parents saw me? What if they still see me this way?"" 

And his child has gotten to know there is a record of those feelings available for everyone to see- forever. I just....that's so cruel. Did anything from his work represent positive feelings he's had from parenting? I'm genuinely interested, this has really been bothering me.

I have been hoping to write a horror film about my own feelings being a disabled person, and one of the things that hurts me the most, every single day, is what I take away from the people who love me.

"I mean, it's your interpretation but it seems slightly cherry picked. Considering less that Charlie WANTS to be a boy but explicitly says that the grandmother WANTS her to be a boy. She doesn't show any indication of wanting to be a boy, if anything she sounds like she resents it. I think you could see it as an insane old woman trying to convince others they're trans.  Don't forget Annie's brother killed himself, citing their mother was trying to put people in him. But in fairness, sure I could see you flipping it. Annie only claims her brother blamed her mother. The grandmother made Charlie a doormat that says Charles. I'll even give you this one too, the father calls her about their son, and she replies by just asking Charlie or when she goes into his room, dreaming of sleepwalking where she sees ants crawling over her sons face (like they did to Charlie) and asks if Charlie is there to which he asks why she's scared of him. 

TL;DR I think it's a good take but you'd have to draw some difficult lines between what exists for fictional plot, and what exists because of meta narrative. Evidently this movie is a very personal story to Ari Aster, so I dunno.

"The whole contraversy of the real life stuff they made light of aside, i thought this movie was fucking hilarious and i laughed out loud multiple times during it, i would have worried that i annoyed people but there was almost no one in the theater and they honestly seemed to get more enjoyment out of my mocking than the movie. 

I don't know if this is something critic's get numb to after a while but i was having fun with it cause i went in knowing that it had something ridiculous like single digits on rotten tomatoes. (at least at the time i saw it) 

the only part where i kind of got into it was the second to last scene when the girl is running around the forest because i thought the idea of slender man as a tree was the only unique thing they added to the idea. They seemed to miss the whole point of slender man because the successful media about him seems to understand that he himself is not scary, it's people's reactions that make the horror, it's almost as if his blank face is a mirror into the madness of our own mind, if you'll allow me to get a little art school here. 

They obviously couldn't have the girls go crazy though because they would have been accused of making light of the real life situation again, so what you end up with is a movie struggling for identity that takes a dozen half-steps into interesting concept but falls flat on it's face because of studio meddling.

"I'm so glad you did this may! As another transgender girl i totally agree with you that there isn't enough content on YouTube from people who are trans (or even lgbt) but don't necessarily have to make content all about that. 

On a personal note i have to say that before this I've noticed you presenting in a somewhat non-binary way which i thought was really cool, but having someone who i know enjoys the same kind of horror media as me but can feel free to present as they like and not have it assumed that it has to inform every aspect of their channel makes me more happy than i can communicate to you. 

I have definitely had people in my life move their imaginary goal posts by saying something isn't ""girly"" enough for me to like and that's such bullshit because cis (non-trans) girls come in all different personalities with wildly varying likes and dislikes.

"I was hoping you'd talk about this one! There are so many reviews just saying ""it's typical don't see it"" but I was really hoping for some deeper exploration, because I for one have a personal essay in my head about how I feel about this movie. I had mixed feelings about the Nun but they sort of all rest under general disappointment. I know a lot of horror fans kind of dismiss the Conjuring movies as being not scary, and I guess whatever, maybe I'm just an uncultured normie but to be mainstream horror movies I think they're really great. Most of my disappointment with this movie actually stems from the fact that the nun/ Valak (Valek? Idk not looking it up) from the Conjuring 2 is actually the scariest horror villain I personally have ever experienced. I saw the movie when it came out two years ago and it didn't really impress me THAT much at first, but a few months later I started having nightmares about the nun. The imagery sort of gradually invaded my dreams and I got to the point where I couldn't even look at still images of her because I found her so frightening. And I can't help but think that that had so much to do with how functional Conjuring 2 is as a movie. The makeup for the nun in that movie is different; the contrast between the black and the white  on Valak's face is stark, and it looks like it's caked on her face. She stands there and she looks uncomfortable and strange, like so out of place it hurts. And emphasis on the fact of her just standing there. In the Conjuring 2 she as a character has a very passive role; the famous hallway scene is an example. She stands there and lures people to her, and even when she attacks she does so from behind a painting--everything is indirect. Even during the climax of that movie, she just stands in the corner, clearly in control of what's going on but just not very physical or hands-on. This works so well for the very reason you mentioned about human emotion. The nun at her best is an allegory for dread or fear. It is powerful and frightening, but that power is subtle and has to act through a lot of different channels. Incidentally, that's why the two most effective sequences in THIS movie (imo) where at the beginning when Valak walks down the hall after the normal nun hangs herself, and when Valak (slowly) chases the psychic nun down the hall. The former sequence got me all pumped for the film before kind of letting me down, and the latter worked to establish Valak's presence in the eyes of our protagonist. The action is slow, creeping, and deliberate, and plays beautifully to the nun's character as it was established in the previous movie. For these same reasons the climax of this movie felt lacking, because the nun has such an active role in the shenanigans that that mystery about her is completely deflated. But anyway thanks again for actually talking about this movie! I'm glad there are people who are willing to be thoughtful about stuff like this :)",7,3,2018-09-10T20:08:11.000Z,hablocomogringo,UCou7_z_YEBFcfpE1HRQdyfQ,isjiybsY5Us,True,UgxyD6pdrIzOA4fUGnt4AaABAg

"I got so excited when I saw the notification for this video. I seriously love your reviews and your optimistic view even on bad movies especially if you talk about a movie that I also watched.  I went to see it with my friend. It was really bad. We laughed our ass off and the guy who was sitting on my left side also made jokes with his own friends. This would be good if this movie would be a horror parody. But it's not. You supposed to take this seriously. Valak's design is garbage. Everytime we see the demon's face upclose it looks like something from a bad 70' s horror. Half of the movie is just the tree main characters walking after stuff that they shouldn't follow, while you grunt in your seat at the stupidity, and a bunch of jumpscares that you can see coming from miles away. There are a couple things that I liked however. The actors are great the athmosphere is really cold and creepy there are several twists at the end and there are a couple of chilly moments but if you watch a lot of horror movies this has nothing new to give you. But I think the only movie that was weaker than this from the Conjouring related movies was Annabell so this is the second worst. Of course it's only my opinion nothing to take too seriously.

"so i waited until i watched the movie a couple times before i watched this to avoid spoliers and see if my initial conclusions and analysis made sense, and they did. they also line up with yours. 
as a trans man the charlie/peter/paimon thing really resonated with me a lot. so did the mother's reaction to it all as that's how my father and grandparents all reacted. the grandmother's relationship with charlie was a lot like my mom's with me and how she's always been accepting and would even introduce me to lgbt friends of hers (the cult) to me so i'd have an easier time coping and finding myself. 

after my first watch i joked about how spent the whole movie looking at peter as ""body goals"" and it turns i wasn't the only one, but the second viewing that stayed in the back of my mind and ended up becoming more than a joke as i watched it play out. my first viewing i watched it and overlooked the dollhouse analysis
but the second time it suddenly smacked me in the face and i couldn't unsee that metaphor. 
i ended up watching a transition from the point of view of an unaccepting relative trying to rationalize things. 

charlie's conversation about how she should have been a boy and the fact that she was 13 (the same age i began to really wonder) was eerily similar to the ""you're not a boy, it's normal to be a tomboy"" conversations i'd have as a kid. the dinner scene made me suddenly think of those rough nights where i'd try to stick up for myself and demand validation only to be guilted and shamed into silence. the scene where the mother tries to bring charlie back through the seance suddenly felt less like a run of the mill horror scene and suddenly brought back vivd memories of attempts at conversion therapy. plus peter was around the age in which i began to fully try and embrace it and come out but was often forced back in the closet, which took a toll on my personal life and caused me to act out and self harm.
 
the first time i watched it i was terrified because the movie really does kill you and is full of insane and horrific stuff that happens all at once without stopping. but my second watch? it suddenly became strangely comforting to me knowing that, in the end, charlie got her body and found acceptance. 

it was a lot like when i watched nightmare on elm st 2 as a kid repressing their identity vs how i watch it now as a fully out gay man, those metaphors suddenly jump out at me whether they were intentional (like elm st) or not. a lot of horror movies that scared me then suddenly make more sense and even comfort me now because the allegories used or connections that could be made relate to parts of me that i used to fear but now accept and even embrace ranging from sexuality and gender to mental illness to surviving trauma. the reason i don't think a lot of people look at horror like that though is because it deals with themes not everyone can relate to, understand, or want to acknowledge due to discomfort. i also think that's why a lot of lgbt, mentally ill, and traumatized people gravitate to horror and especially like movies like this, ones the mainstream doesn't ""get"" and takes at face value, the subtext becomes bold and we see things others don't and we understand what the movie is trying to say or what could be taken from it. 

a lot of cis people would probably argue and say i'm just projecting, and maybe they're right, but in the end i and many other trans people are coming to a similar conclusion and i dont think that's just a coincidence. there are reasons gay people and addicts project on vampires, bi people project on werewolves, trauma suvivors project on final girl slasher flicks, lesbians project on movies like jennifer's body, mentally ill people project on possession and supernatural horror, and trans people are projecting on movies like hereditary. we see them and we get it in a way you only could if you were going through it. it's a lot harder not to see it when it directly parallels with your life. and sometimes the allegory is intentional (like how some vampire movies are explicitly about addiction or some gay coded horror movies are doing it to start that conversation), but a lot of the time it just happens and unless you're going through that struggle, you're not gonna see what we see. and in this case trans people are all watching this movie and walking away with feelings amd conclusions cis people most likely wouldn't.

(this was a lot longer than i intended but i just have so much to say about hereditary and the use of horror to talk about difficult and demonized things in general. it's so much more than movies meant to scare and disturb you and not enough people give tthe genre the credit and thought it deserves.)",3,0,2018-09-10T17:49:59.000Z,Erik Jones,UCxNP9f_TB7thpKGwf78_wsA,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgyBfO_zl9SUDmXWUcx4AaABAg

I was so glad to stumble across your channel some years back because it truly is one of the most unique ones on YouTube in my opinion, you manage to make your videos feel incredibly personal even when discussing incredibly abstract concepts, you present a warm atmosphere yet still keeping in tone with what drew us here in the first place, horror and our love for all things macabre.

I'm glad you're happier now Nyx and although you have our support unendingly, remember that you don't need it, you're who you were supposed to be and that's a wonderful thing

"To lovely May:

So this has been a crazy month for me, and honestly, I wish I'd gotten to this video sooner, because this video came out one day before my birthday and wow, the cosmic timing of this is all super amazing in hindsight.

I've been following your videos and work for a long time now, and I'm such a huge fan of yours. Your work has helped me feel good on such bad days and I genuinely love your take on a lot of your reviews; I really should comment on more of them. Ok to get to the point though-- I came out as trans this month too (again just a day after this video was posted), and I have so many emotional, positive, overwhelming emotions to shout at you May! Although I'm making a transition to the opposite gender spectrum here, I am sitting here trying to not cry from how absolutely amazing this video has left me.

I am SO happy you decided to do this as a video and to your audience, and so happy you can take those steps forward into letting everyone know who you are. I have and still will be 100% behind you in your progress and career and can't wait to see more of you and your work.

those small things... those small things really show me how much i love myself and want to be myself, doing what i do. i feel like that attitude is similar to the idea that trans people should just... exist, as themselves, and their whole existence doesn't have to be TRANS CONTENT(tm)(tm)(tm). i can just be myself, visible, there for any kid who might need it.

"so they say the the movie is haunted.. that would mean they are responsible for people coming to harm by bringing it in syndication?
they harm the film attendant who have to stay and watch the movie in case equipment breaks for example...

so wouldn't that mean that, if you believe in that shit,  if a viewer dies or comes to harm, the team would be murderers (or if not that then involuntary manslaughter or negligent manslaughter out of greed for the money they get from people who view the movie and possibly getting harmed?

like if he'd believe that, would be be better than the poor drug dealer on the street who sells to feed their own habit and also harms people?

"I appreciate your perspective. I'd really like to talk about the aesthetic of the movie. The way it was shot. I know you were hinting pretty heavy at it in your video, but coming from an AV background myself, it's almost impossible to ignore. The way things were framed almost perfectly centered throughout the movie is NOT the ""natural"" way films are taught to be shot. But in doing so, it creates an artificial atmosphere, as if we were a person... looking into a dollhouse. One very telling part was when she went to Joan's apartment. Everything just looked TOO pristine, TOO perfect. The road was absolutely immaculate, the yard impeccably kept, the hallway of the apartment absolutely and completely clear of evidence of anyone actually living there. It was not shot with the exact same aesthetic, but definitely a telling sign that, even in this artificial world, that particular part of the narrative is more than likely less real than the rest of what we're seeing.",0,0,2018-08-25T06:20:06.000Z,Alex Scott,UCPNr8Uj7d8l5fo2KflfXgmg,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgzSMLoSRhGPXphE7Jh4AaABAg

"The thing with Slenderman is that like...If you look at Marble Hornets, Tribe Twelve, and EveryManHybrid, while they all have Slenderman in them it isn't...*just* Slenderman. TT and EMH have other supernatural entities dancing around, The Collective, Habit, and The Rake. They're the active ones, the ones who we keep watching for. Marble Hornets was never really about Slender to begin with. Yes, he was a monster that existed and messed with memories. But he wasn't the antagonist. Alex was. Marble Hornets was about slowly building a rapport with all of these characters, understanding where they came from and where they were going, and then getting slapped in the face with proof that they weren't in any way okay. It was all about personal connection to the characters and the shattering of our perceptions of them. It was not a jumpscare monster haunting with spoopy moosic and awful CGI.

Slenderman doesn't work for all of the reasons you said he doesn't: He's a tall dude in a suit without a face. Tentacles are optional. Either way doesnt matter. He does. Not. Work. Thats why the writers need to work extra hard to build a story around him, with him in the background as a vague threat or an instigator, and with other stuff taking the center stage. That's why, from the moment I saw the trailer for this movie, I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was going to be awul.

It was about paranoia and desperation and the way the characters' lives disintegrate and become consumed by something they have no ability to control.

"Edit: Making this my own thread because I actually put effort into it and am curious if people agree with me.

I have a movie pitch I think would have been a huge hit, or at least a LOT better then what we got. I think using Slenderman opens a door to a lot of people for certain concepts and context, and that exploring the nature of ""the fear of the unknown"" and the dark possibilities of memes could have been a great movie. Imagine if it was treated like RL, where Slenderman was actually like a real creepypasta turning into a viral phenomenon but going out of control (kinda like how did it but way worse and dramatized). Now lets make society it's self the main character as much as any one person.

Imagine playing with that intense desire to know more about things like Slenderman and urban legends. Is it real? What is it? Are WE making it real? WHAT are people turning this thing into and WHY? 

Like a mimetic virus that turns idiot fans into killers, into copycat killers, until you have something like the Halloween murder clown chaos but an actually deadly serial killer craze... but how much is hype, media blowing it out of proportion, pranks, murderous troubled kids, or actually paranormal is all the center focus. People keep bringing up all the backstories and lore as they try to explain Slender AND the Slender ""craze"" but it just adds to the confusion and makes it grow. 

People start wondering about the serious negative cultural and psychological effects, (like a way worse version of the D&D satanic panic of the 80s) if it's more then one thing and whispers of if the paranormal is finally getting revealed. Then while the skeptical main character starts researching all the lore and actual webseries (because lets fucking reference them at least), trying to figure out what's entertainment and what's real if any part of it is, they start having a grounded/realistic mix of ""possible"" hallucinations as they start to get paranoid and convince themselves it's real more and more...

Throw in a dash of the macabre, unexplainable, and some sense of unknowable lovecraftian terror that ""might"" be behind it all, (Think something like ""John Carpenter's: In the Mouth of Madness"") but the equal terror that it could just be the destructive nature of human superstition. 

Honestly, I can imagine an amazing, terrifying movie with a lot to say in vivid detail. Almost like the Slenderman creators/mythos doing a case study of it's self and how it became what it all is. Though granted, Nyx is right that it all depends on our personal imaginations and this could just be what ""I"" wanted.",2,0,2018-08-23T22:52:26.000Z,Gray The Odd,UC4TI3DdVa8MM-Tx8yfM2EqQ,46o5nGor8e8,True,Ugzr_F90hxiEbPEv8pJ4AaABAg

"1. No summoning of Slendy. Why summon him? Why watch some stupid video wanting to summon him? I would have started off with the missing girl and gone from there. Slowly introduce the supernatural elements. Maybe have Slendy pop in a corner here and there, but keep him hidden until maybe the 35 min mark. Don‚Äôt even MENTION his name until that mark either. Make it a mysterious missing persons case.

2. No / fewer Jumpscares. Why do we need a huge BANG everytime the shadowy figure emerges? Silence is much scarier than noise. They‚Äôre so many instances where a character is walking and Slendy appears in a corner and all the music does is a loud thud noise. It‚Äôs stupid. I didn‚Äôt jump once. Have Slendy appear in a corner with only natural sounds. See if the audiences notice him on there own. Have ONE really good jumpscare instead of 100 stupid ones, OR none at all.

3. WAY Too Much CGI. Come on? CGI for a tall call in a suit? You only need to use CGI for things that you can‚Äôt do in real life. Why can‚Äôt you find an actor who‚Äôs maybe 6-7 feet tall, lanky, put him a black suit and apply some faceless make-up? That would have been effective, maybe put some cool lighting on him too. Have him walk slowly or maybe slightly off? The Marble Hornets movie did a great job with this (and everything else.)

4. Better Script. One of the major downfalls was the story. Slendy has so much lure and mystery, why couldn‚Äôt something more unique be done? With a monster that abducts kids, maybe have it from the parent‚Äôs point of view? Show his / her grief. Show how devastated they are. If you must use teens, maybe have one search for her / his missing sibling? Build up the characters instead of throwing us a bunch of cliches.

Check out DeviantArt for Slendy art and ideas. Fans have come up with great ideas and concepts, Slendy should not be a cookie cutter horror movie. It should be so much more. With all the fan theories and all the mystery, I do think Slender Man could have had a really nice story-maybe even excellent. Slender has been around for 10 years, and the script was most likely written by someone who didn‚Äôt even KNOW who Slendy was. I would have given ideas to REAL fans. Give them a chance to shine.

5. Better Direction and Editing. There‚Äôs a movie I loved, called ‚ÄúThe Strangers.‚Äù Came out in 2008. The direction was fantastic. Just little things he did with the camera were awesome. The lack of music, using your surroundings as a character, build up to things, make us feel suspense. This is Slender Man, not Jason Voorhees. The point of Slendy is a psychological terror. I‚Äôd even say ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù would have been good inspiration as well with its incredible sound design. If I could, I would have hired maybe the guy who directed ‚ÄúThe Descent‚Äù, Neil Marshall, or my dad suggested Ryan Murphy, who does ‚ÄúAmerican Horror Story.‚Äù For writing? I‚Äôd say Victor Surge, let him write his character and his vision. If not him, maybe James Wan? Or, an unknown? Have Blumhouse pictures release it or A24.

Final Thoughts. This is so sad. Slendy has SO much potential. So many cool pictures and short films, and this is what we get? Again, it‚Äôs sad. It makes me want to make my own feature-length Slender Man movie and give fans what they deserve.",0,1,2018-08-23T12:46:02.000Z,Aaron/Equus21,UCI7FvMy03BUxiFt8AXHivXQ,46o5nGor8e8,True,UgypgbZHV7UlWJP-Yst4AaABAg

"Well duh, of course I'll accept you. You're the same person you were before, just now describing yourself in a way that feels more honest to yourself.

I'm not always sure how to respond to someone's coming out thing. I feel similar to how you do about that manipulative sigh at the beginning of videos ""like this"": That if I just give a bunch of swooning positivity about how I accept you, you're beautiful just the way you are, etc. etc., that it's not entirely genuine? Not in the sense that I don't accept you because I do, but that doing so in such an over-the-top way kind of rubs me the wrong way sometimes. 

In a weird way, it feels less sincere than me just going ""Okay, I'll just switch up the pronouns I mentally used before."" Because I guess to me it's just...just like learning what sort of pizza toppings you like, I guess.

"My experience is very similar to yours, in that I knew from a young age. I did tell my parents, but this was the early 1990's and 
understanding your trans child wasn't really the hip cool thing to do yet (god I'm so happy ppl are coming around and supporting their kids more and more these days). I didn't know there was a word for it, or that there was anything I could DO about it- I just knew I was a boy. To the point that when I knew I was getting to the age where I was going to grow breasts, I basically started having panic attacks about it. I tried to push it to the back of my mind for the longest time. No, I was just a tomboy. No, I was just a lesbian. No I was just a boyish lesbian. I'm not sure if I just tried not to understand myself, or if i was afraid, but I blocked it out. When I was a teen, I came out to one of my best friends online, who had always had a crush on me. He told me ""no, you're not a boy. You're a beautiful woman."" He didn't care about me or my happyness, and to this day... I've forgotten his name. I just know he was an asshole.

I started testosterone about a year and a half ago, and in April I was able to finally have top surgery, after years of struggling with my appearance and body. Transitioning has done so many great things for me. I like myself now. I never did before. I feel like I belong in my body, instead of an alien inside a weird, ugly suit that I borrowed from someone that was the opposite of my size. 

Knowing what it did for me, both the actual transition, and the coming out socially, being seen as a man... I'm so excited for you. And I'm so happy that you're opening up about this... Knowing how many queer, and especially trans youth tend towards the horror genres, and might feel welcomed, no longer alone, knowing that there's an amazing woman like you working and sharing her story and her perspective on the genre, to whom they can look up to.

"I thank you for coming out. I thought you seemed to be transitioning in your appearance the past couple months, but I never asked. It's nice and important that you told us but it doesn't change my feelings about you as they are not based on how you look or identify. If I have/had a concern it was about you obviously moving out. 

You had been in the process of creating a space to make videos (at your parents home?) and then you moved out. My worry is that was the transition part of a break with your parents. I can't help it (I am a mom to 8). Worry and acceptance/love are a big deal to me. One of the most heart breaking things for me is seeing children rejected by family for these kinds of revelations.

That said, I sincerely hope that you just moved out because it's what adult kids do. I hope your loved ones still openly love you (and even better that they understand or are trying to). I wish I could support your channel via patreon but it's just not possible financially. I do watch, rate, and share your content, though.

"So speaking as a folklorist (hi, my channel is mostly about folklore) the thing that fascinated me so much about the Slenderman is that the ideas and stories and ""canon"" around it came together in basically just the same way that real world folklore does, except at a far more rapid rate; it was incredible to watch it unfolding in real time and seeing how the internet was giving folklore these new avenues. 
Similarly, what you said about the community driven and created entity not translating to film applies to a lot of folklore as well. The Fenian and Ulster Cycles of Irish folklore and myth for example consist of so many conflicting tales with so many conflicting versions they'd be impossible to truly capture in cinema without having to dillute and condense what makes them so incredible.

He eats one of the kids and then has his skinned face mock the other before grabbing him.

"Of course we accept you. We watch because your content is great. I for one am definitely not going anywhere, I love your insights and film recomendations. Just keep making the same content you always do, but dress how you feel comfortable. We now know to call you May, and to use the correct pronouns. I think it was good and important to clarify that, if only so we don't accidentally say the wrong thing. Whilst I welcome trans content and expanding awareness, I think its more valuable in general for any minority to be represented in mainstream media by making neutral content - for example a black, or asian, or gay, or disabled, or overweight, or any other minority playing a lead role in a film where the focus is on what makes them different will only serve to pidgeon hole and perpetuate stereotypes and enforce differences. A character that could have been played by anyone, and just happens to be a minority, but this is only a small part of what defines the character, is far more powerful as it normalises things and helps people relate, and realise that deep down that we are all the same. Your ""role"" is that of a film critic, scholar and entertainer - those are all things where sex, gender, race, age, size, sexuality, nationality etc are minor factors - the important part is are you a good and entertaining film critic - and I'd argue that you're one of the very best around.

"So I understand why people would want to question you coming out as trans as there are a lot of people who will put on the trans label and then not commit to it. Many people nowadays believe that just being androgynous means your automatically trans. The transtrenders have muddied the waters a bit by thinking that dressing a certain way makes them a certain way. And being trans means that people are going to ask questions about it.
But there‚Äôs something you said that kinda just struck me as the perfect thing you could have said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to make transgender content, I just want to exist and continue to make the content I want to make‚Äù
The fact that you want to continue to create content and that being trans for you is not going to be your entire identity and your entire experience means that you have the right idea of where to go from here.

I mean, Freddy Kruger, Pennywise and The Thing are all extremely absurd creations but they can still be effectively terrifying. Even your repeated point of ""it's a guy in a suit"" doesn't make sense to me. Victorian figures like slender man are well documented in how creepy they can be. 
*2) This is the best case scenario for a Slender Man movie.* I think you mean the best case scenario for a movie that treats Slender Man the way this movie does, but it doesn't have to be this way. You frequently say, 'it doesn't do any jokey stuff', which indicates that it could have, so clearly there's another, potentially better movie this could have been. I think you could have made a Slender Man movie that was about teen mental illness or something like that, the way that The Babadook (another guy in a suit) was really about grief and the anxieties of a parent / child relationship and the titular monster only ever played second fiddle to these themes.",1,0,2018-08-22T14:48:17.000Z,baileysmithful,UCH0I7uPqP_YUtcojzzMOCbg,46o5nGor8e8,True,UgzCsb-1fb_rojUImLB4AaABAg

"I've known for a while since I followed you on twitter before a couple of alt-right accounts started targeting and threatening my life, but that's unrelated and silly.

I guess ever since I've known there's been almost this disconnect I've felt with you, but it's not because being trans is wrong or non-existent or any of that, it's more personal.  There's been a lack of sensitive guys in my life who can love and enjoy art in every form.  Guys who also get targeted by the more conservative community simply because they aren't manly enough or share the same opinion.  I think I felt this connection start to grow with you when I first watched one of those videos and you jokingly called yourself a 'beta male', something that's commonly thrown around to insult ones masculinity.  

I'm glad you're happy and that you're finally becoming what you've always wanted to be.  It's a gift that's long overdue for you.  For me, what I want to be is some terrible cosmic horror from the deep reaches of the unknown.  I feel this way because I've never been able to protect myself as a pacifist.  I'm a passive person and despite being 6'3, having abs and broad shoulders, people still feel the need to come over and 'dominate me' as the alpha man.  I can't describe how much I hate that.  The idea of being some awful eldritch thing that shakes fear into everyone just by looking at it is comforting.  It would mean that I wouldn't have to defend myself from the low levels of humanity.  

I think I got side tracked there.  Anyways.  
I think I just need to build up this connection with the new you.  I know it's the same person that's made all those other videos I've loved.  But I just haven't seen anything similar since.  I'm a waitin' Mae.

Kinda how stephen King is really intriguing to read, but if you just explain the core ideas, it becomes laughable. Still very much enjoyed the video.

"I have been a slenderman fangirl since... jeez, 2009? When did Marble Hornets start? And I wasn't even a kid then I was in my early 20s. 

I feel like the reason this movie just does not work is because you're basically taking something that grew in popularity as a ""ooooh maybe this could be true~"" scary story (I always think of Slenderman as the internet age equivalent of a campfire story, the one eyed man with a hook for a hand type deal) and make this huge fuss of a production that basically labels it as false and overdone. The real fear of slenderman was in shaky handicam footage in the dark, late at night, from someone who appeared to be panicked and scared. It was the brief, albeit very obviously false, idea that MAYBE it was real. The movie kinda wrecks all that. 

The fear in slenderman is that when he gets the victim, the victim drops the camera and we don't see what happens. We don't see if they die, we don't see if he teleports them to his tickle dimension, we don't KNOW what happens. What is slenderman? What is his motivation? What exactly is the limit of his power? The fact that these things remain unanswered is kinda the whole point of his fear, and our imaginations fill that ambiguous space with the worst stuff imaginable. Once you try making an origin story, or a high budget film that shows him clear as day center shot (as opposed to a blurry white face peeking from on top of the treeline), he stops being scary at all because the real answer will NEVER be as scary as your imagination can make it seem.

all in all, I loved the movie, it was the BEST comedy of 2018. I haven't laughed so hard at a movie, ever. 10/10 movie, a raging dumpster fire but the dumpsters full of glitter so its both horrific and just goddamned surreally beautiful in its horrific ugliness.",3,0,2018-08-22T14:11:49.000Z,Rena V.,UCst-BLa8p7UAupFsnPUaoAg,46o5nGor8e8,True,UgwwwPUygaNacKbJ4Nh4AaABAg

"The whole ""Spooky monsters need a psychological grounding in order to be scary"" thing especially reminds me of indie horror video games like the ones John Wolfe plays. After that aborted Silent Hills trailer became an over night sensation, a lot of amateur game devs tried to do what PT did. But walking though the same hallway over and over again WASN'T WHAT WAS SCARY. PT was scary because it was about feelings of inadequacy as a provider driving a man to murder his middle class family as a reaction to economic turmoil. That's something real and resonating with today's culture, and PT explored it in an intimate way. The repeating hallway is scary BECAUSE it represents both the monotony and decaying nature of the character's domestic life. And because the ghosts weren't random boogedies, but people we are told we both loved and destroyed. But most people with WAY too many Unity assets in their library didn't understand that horror games require the basics of storytelling like ""characters"" and ""conflict"" so instead we just got a bunch of tedious hallway loops.",1,0,2018-08-22T12:53:47.000Z,Heather Calun,UCogQkiqJuigZ8EODsJ3q2tA,RqVd8vNadEU,True,UgzC-TLy-FYxlJxFGIR4AaABAg

As far as a the best case scenario thing goes, theres an indie film that came out a few years back called Always Watching, which had Doug Jones play Slender Man.

"What even was the point of this movie, like it's way too late to draw anyone who would have been remotely interested in the idea and the people who are currently interested are probably too young to see this film. It's just absurd. Like, I was super into creepypasta at one point and I totally get what May's saying about how when you see the idea realised in a movie it just all kind of falls apart because it isn't constructed in a way that is conductive to being adaptable in any form besides how it currently exists on the internet. I mean, imagine a Jeff the Killer movie and how awful that would be? Or something like the rake or Squidward suicide, there isn't enough there to make something coherent but there's enough to make something half formed.

"I hardly notice a difference... is that insulting to say? I realize it might be disheartening to someone making a big change in their life to hear that but this is honestly refreshing. I feel like I'm just seeing another side of you rather than seeing someone I thought I knew become someone else.

What really matters is that you're happy and improving yourself. There's nothing worse than making a big decision and realizing the thing you thought was bringing you down wasn't the issue, that the chosen solution didn't fix the problem. Finding a way to be happy with yourself is a constant struggle and I would never relent a person seeking self satisfaction no matter how big a change that entails.

"I've been out for a couple years and I get the early jitters.  I totally get having to deal with the BS - the reaction from my family was less than stellar when I came out, especially since Caitlyn Jenner started blowing up in popular media while I was in the process of coming out. Some people referring to me as a trans-woman by the name 'Caitlyn' (not my name, so I guess it was almost like their pet slur for me) while otherwise referring to me by my legal name, as if I was two different people, was probably the worst I've ever felt. I was raised in the middle of the Midwest and I didn't know there was any sort of trans besides transvestism until I was in early college, even though I'd unintentionally come out to two partners before I knew there was even a word for transgender.  I'm glad you're coming out, it might help some other people who are struggling with or discovering their identity feel a sense of community.

"I think the movie's got a serious disadvantage when it comes to adapting Slenderman stuff, because basically the entire context of the horror is in the paratext. The original pictures' main creep factor is the concept that someone was looking through some old photos and found a creepy ghost guy that nobody else noticed, especially not the people in the photo or the person taking the picture. Marble Hornets takes that sort of effect and runs with it, exploiting video titles, descriptions, upload dates, the concept that this is being hosted on a YouTube channel and even has characters in the story upload videos to a second channel. It's all a metatextual game and the ultimate form of ""found footage."" The entire story is portrayed not only as real, but as happening right now, and you get to interact with the characters. Another Slenderman series, EverymanHYBRID, has even used things as diverse as Tumblr blogs and Twitter polls to tell its story. You just cannot fit this sort of narrative into a single feature-length video clip without some serious work and/or reinvention.",1,0,2018-08-22T07:56:21.000Z,thechucknorrisofNSMB,UCxNDXk85wupBjx4nwI9P26g,46o5nGor8e8,True,UgxH8bSEykiMvYbfUAB4AaABAg

Please don't take this the wrong way, but Its never really mattered what gender you ascribe to. I like your videos because You seem like an awesome person.

If you are content in yourself then it doesn't need to be rubbed in peoples faces to make a point. I think you reveling that you are a girl will only become an issue if you make it one. Just be who you are and those who like you for you will stick around and really who can ask for more

"may im so proud of you for making this video!! and i completely agree with your comment that just having more trans people visible (not necessarily only making trans content) is super necessary. cis people still don't see us as ""normal"" so we need to ""normalize"" ourselves.

also on the para-friendship thing, idk if this is embarrassing to say but you just seem like the coolest, friendliest person that i catch myself thinking of you fondly as a friend even though you don't know me. that one-way friendship can be dangerous depending on who the person is, where people over-stimulate or over-engage with creators of celebrities at like cons and stuff even tho they only see you as a weirdo stranger that seems obsessed with them.

anyway, i hope you publicize this video, i think your viewers that haven't realized yet need to know how important this is to you. im really proud of you and im so happy that you're more confident in yourself now

"I have a lot of trans friends and while it's a big thing that's alright it's also a big thing that makes them really happy! I'm not trans, but it still makes me really happy anytime someone on youtube comes out because all that does is make people more aware that hey, not only trans people exist and that's okay, but trans people exist and are just as damn brilliant and clever as anyone else. Like with Laura k dale or Bunny Bennett, the more brilliant people in creative media  who come out  publicly (which is super brave btw) the less ground bigots will have to stand on.

When i was maturing into an adult I never really, thought about trans stuff? Like i was isolated from the concept and didn't find it weird but also didnt think it was a thing either, if that makes sense. But then i exposed myself to media with those narrative strings, and again Bunny came out at just the right time for me to realize hey, trans people exist and they just so happen to be pretty damn cool too. It helped a lot with me not turning into another bigot of ignorance.

Long and poorly thought out rambles, i guess what i'm trying to say is I know for a fact that a lot of people, your younger fans or heck, maybe some of the older ones who've loved your work for ages, are gonna see this and they're gonna think ""huh, i should look more into this subject"" and they'll educate themselves and the world will become just that much more of a understanding place. heck you probably are gonna wind up being the impetus for some people realizing their own issues with their bodies aren't just normal self loathing but might be tied into the concept of gender identity! 

I know that seems kinda pompous but like, you coming out like this is gonna have a really good positive impact for everyone in the long term, even if in the short term you anger some people who wouldn't have been understanding regardless of how they found out.

"It's very simple as to why this was bad: the very concept physically cannot be crafted into a cinematic format due to its very nature. When something is made and crafted by a community, it has a very simple pipeline. Someone creates an idea and posts it on the internet. This acts as a *base* for expansion by others who create a community, united under one idea. Cinema is traditionally very dramatic. Regardless of the genre there is always a 'bass' or 'sub-bass' of drama that inherently drags a serious nature into film. How serious or evident it is depends on the writing and production as you naturally shape the script in your image. 

The best example of how to do things right is the now-infamous series known as Marble Hornets. They took the base idea and expanded greatly on it, filling in the gaps and creating a legitimate lore for Slender Man that could be used in their rendition. Thanks to the method of shooting and delivery, they created a new world that had high capacity for empathy with the audience. The realism and down-to-earth production drew people in and created a series that is often cited for both inspiration and story elements in subsequent stories and webseries. This movie simply ripped the core concept and tried to make filler with special effects and pointless events.

Summary: the problem with this movie is that it failed to actually expand on the concept of Slender Man and chose to more or less 'port' the core idea into cinema. This drags nothing but a dull antagonist with no real motive or substance into a media medium that adds serious overtones into the story, making it hoaky and a waste of time. It wasn't even some kind of community taboo or anything like that, it was the fact that they made a second-rate film with the most loose interpretation of Slender Man that is basically the cinematic cousin of The Bye-Bye Man. It's honestly debatable about which is worse: this, or Always Watching.

Both should be burned in a fire, but that's just me.",2,0,2018-08-22T02:49:38.000Z,Yoshii,UCqSQYQO6SQjeLz7DRZpPM0A,46o5nGor8e8,True,UgxZYpZLydJyjufVmAF4AaABAg

"Slenderman strikes me as the type of figure that loses all impact when in motion. He's definitely in the weeping angels camp for me, where the reason he's spooky is that he's just sitting there not giving a damn that you can see him, and in no rush to do his thing. At worst, not seeing him move leaves that up to the imagination, and I don't think there's a way for any creature to move that's scarier than not knowing.

If he has to move, I think the closest you can get to suiting his vibe is making his movements look very choppy, almost like you're seeing him with a low framerate, or like he's teleporting a little every time you blink. Fluid movement robs his lanky ass of spook factor because the logistics of those proportions in motion will always be more comical than terrifying.",22,0,2018-08-21T23:38:02.000Z,AMaliciousMoose,UCN_0aqYbIOypWiLJjkDq63w,46o5nGor8e8,True,UgxFRDAU4bW8Oq8nqzt4AaABAg

"As someone who hasn't (yet?) seen the film and whose interest in the creature starts and ends at the original photos, I have to agree with the hot takes here - for the most part. Even though based on what I've seen it would be accurate to say the the film is an _accurate_ depiction of the creepypasta culture it spawned from, I'm hesitant to believe that what we got is the best we could get. A more creative direction - or hell, just better execution - could easily reinvigorate the hype and scares. Some problems with telling a Slender Man story are in the fundamentals, but the problems here are more just endemic to crappy modern horror: Nobody talks like a real person, the sequence of events is absurd, terrible acting, poor visuals, etc. 

I fully get the exhaustion over this character, though - I feel like the creature only ever really _worked_ in the original Eric Knudsen photoshops. In those, you could only make out just enough from the man to tell something was seriously off, but he was also snugly integrated into packs of children in broad daylight who seem unaware or uncaring of his presence. The dread you're intended to feel from those pictures is comparable to taking a shoe off out of discomfort and, upon inspection, finding a bunch of spiders or cockroaches. That startling confusion of ""how did this get here? how long was it already here?"" is incredibly powerful, I feel.

I really liked this video. Keep giving us hot takes, May. You're rad.",6,0,2018-08-21T21:20:49.000Z,Ian Love,UCmNECSNKqFbbj-Z7jA-y3bA,46o5nGor8e8,True,Ugwt9AmFsPcm5LwRdTd4AaABAg

"The definitive Slender Man is the game ""Slender: The Arrival"". The character of Slendy is v. strong there, but discussed in various contexts and has undertones of childhood abandonment, agrarian childhoods, mining accidents, broken relationships, rekindling childhood flames or just reconnecting to the past. There is an overall message that obsessing over the past is harmful, and will end your life.
Everyone just play that, it's very good.

"i went to see this with my best friend and we ALMOST had the theater to ourselves but people came in at the last minute. 

anyway i find the biggest fault with this movie aesthetically is that slenderman looks different in almost every scene hes in, they cant even keep their monster consistent and its really annoying. The library scene with the little slendermans coming out of the walls made me laugh wayyyy too hard.

also i feel a slenderman movie COULD work, if you formatted it like the blair witch project. if you dont explain him or try to delve into his lore (which lets people who like certain lore versions enjoy without conflict) and just let him do his thing, acting as some kind of unstoppable unknowable force that targets children and teens, i feel that would be the scariest they could do. the downside is that at the end of the day it really would just be a blair witch rip off, and you could also do this set up with literally any kind of monster from werewolves to vampires and have it be effective to a degree.",23,1,2018-08-21T20:25:18.000Z,JohnnyHorror,UCuE7c1fHm74dlurb6sSmeug,46o5nGor8e8,True,UgyhhBaPkMLcV2GMcSd4AaABAg

"Thank you so much for making this!! During the ending of this movie I was so thrilled about how all the events unravelled, I was too convinced that this was the mothers way to cope and how she thought everything went down and attempts to warrant her actions. During the very last scene I was thinking to myself how the mother had finally made the son into the devil she believed him to be and how he crumbled under her, starting to believe it himself. She's harming them and the only way to cope with that is to justify it by thinking you're saving them. When the lights came on, I heard people groaning angrily in the cinema, and I could tell they thought it was too ridiculous. And like yeah, if that's your only perspective I guess maybe it is?

I tried to turn to the internet to find someone who shared my take on it but everyone took it so literally and tbh I'm surprised?? Every review just rants about how it's a shame that it took a supernatural turn and I'm just like ???? 

I believed it to be very Lynchian in a way, depicting a state of mind or a subjective experience (or, an art piece) rather than a tangible reality.

"I find in the modern day and age, the internet generation has taken surrealism-and the irony of surrealism- as their own. So stuff like vaporwave, which is a genre about analyzing what we like about styles of music, is easy to appreciate. Suddenly, smashmouth, whose songs are sung with the comically unflappable malaise in the face of dystopia that characterized much of the nineties, unviels an honestly bitter railing against the cruelty and injustice of life.
A toothless 80s pop song can be a fountain of raunchy comedy. A song about letting the bodies hit the floor can be a gun electro song. A rock anthem can be a vanilla car ride song and vice versa. The barriers between the intentional and unintentional are much thinner to the open minded and vaporwave in a way fosters that open-mindedness.",0,0,2018-08-07T08:54:27.000Z,kilian G.,UC10aQ0jIybkhLDzypRZBN9A,-D-iWeD4SVM,True,Ugw1DJeEQ6wRBsMFA4x4AaABAg

A variety of books, conferences and related materials have been created surrounding belief in the idea of indigo children and their nature and abilities.

"Great stuff. I actually watched this film in the theaters when I was around 10 and it has had a lasting impact on me. I have to disagree with you on Phoenix. Phoenix to me is eventually like Winslow and Swan - ready to give anything, to sell her soul to achieve her goal. Initially she just wants to sing, however, there are lines she won't cross - not interested in the casting couch with the initial audition. 

Then a taste of fame in the music business warps her e.g., earlier on she states when asked by Swan what she would give to sing ""anything you want"" basically willing to sell her soul and give the casting couch a whirl for a chance to sing good music. From this she becomes to willing to sell her soul and jump in bed for fame - later ""just give me that crowd again"" and giving up on Winslow's love because she truly loves fame ""don't you hear them?? Why should I give that up?? I'll give them whatever they want"" Now willing to sell her soul for the crowd/fame.

But you're smart and thoughtful and you are so good at this, I think you're probably better than just about every other self obsessed asshole on this site trying to deconstruct movies to make themselves sound intelligent. I don't get that from you at all, because this is something you're actually really thinking about, really considering, and really actually good at. So I've finally subscribed.

"I just saw this movie and loved it. I like your interpretation, May, and it's definitely the most coherent reading I've heard yet. I also saw trans stuff in this film, but I came at it a little differently.

The first thing that brought it to mind was Charlie's ""She wanted me to be a boy"" comment toward the beginning. I read her as expressing this as a negative thing, and I mean, ""family wants to force little girl to be a boy"" is a quintessentially trans girl experience. And I mean just, I feel like Charlie's a really easy character to relate to as a trans woman.

Then there's the big reveal of the cult conspiracy as we reach the climax. My initial impression was that Paimon was just completely irrelevant except insofar as he's the thing the cult wants Charlie to be. I got the impression the supernatural stuff is real, but Paimon is fake. It's just Charlie's ghost, Charlie's scared, traumatized, little girl ghost. And there's this whole society grandma was a part of that reads this deep spiritual meaning into forcing her to be a boy, when it's really just the cruel and pointless thing they're doing for their own mundane benefit (""riches,"" as the book mentions the conjurer of Paimon will be rewarded with).

Anyway, that's all I have. It's disjointed and incomplete, but I thought you might like to hear it since it's sort of like your interpretation in reverse. Thank you for all the wonderful videos you make!",0,0,2018-07-16T08:10:37.000Z,NaninaniÊüêÂ≠ê,UCPvU1J1p7x-ttVq-cOo2GTw,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,Ugwjx412AMmsyEgwl094AaABAg
"I've been experiencing hypnagogia and strange occurrences more and more recently. It's hard to explain. But when I transcend into this state at night, everything makes sense. It can feel like time stops and I get answers to questions I didn't have. However, when I leave this transcended thought I become confused and full of anxiety. There are many theories I have come up with. The biggest thing is that this is all starting to feel simulated. I know it's crazy to think. There are so many different variables and the idea is too complex for me to fully grasp or explain. But any idea of something other than now seems crazy. God, nothing, afterlife etc. Everything seems crazy until it's perceived as reality. Man flying etc.¬†


There is definitely something I/we are missing. Yet the answer feels so close. Like its right in front of my face. It also feels like I had more answers before but I currently cannot obtain them.¬†

What is life? An experience. Chemicals, neural pathways, electrons, nerves are going off to create an experience I understand. What if those experiences could be simulated by man down to the smallest detail. Better yet down to even smaller details. How is that different from reality as we know. It seems more like an improved copy.¬†

Like the universe just endlessly expanding and copying itself. For some reason to avoid nothing. But if the universe came from nothing why is it avoiding nothing. It can always come back. I can always be ""alive"" because I am ""alive"" now. I came from nothing, I remember nothing before being ""born"". So it could happen again. If this world and/or these thoughts are just being simulated then by who. And who simulated who simulated who etc. Like the owl would ask who who-who. Knowledge is power. Time is irrelevant. 


We are only looking through a glass window. The window needs to be opened. I believe the advancement of knowledge and technology will help us understand how to open the window and realize what's on the other side. Endless possibilities.


For the most part, I'm just creating a story for entertainment. while Allowing my mind to open up to different possibilities. But when the hypnagogia kicks in these stories start to feel real, especially if I'm watching a movie.¬†So day by day it is starting to feel more like I have an alternate personality and perception of reality.

I know most likely I'm just stressed and I can choose to not think about any of this. When I dive too deep into these thoughts I get a dark sleep paralysis. At first, I'll believe its someone from a different reality waking me up but then I get scared of the realization that everything I know isn't as it seems so the person coming for me morphs into something that wants to kill me and then I suddenly wake up. That is my IT. 
Sorry for the random rambling and unorganized thoughts. Thought I would give you a real example of hypnagogia. Never had a word for it until now. Thank you.",3,0,2018-07-16T06:54:09.000Z,Live Limitless,UCJ65zVxbn1BuMOenz81ZYnw,SbZpUlhUK3s,True,UgyP-9YMymZnNgTT8ON4AaABAg

"Thank you so much for making this video! Like many people these books were a big part of my childhood and along with other scary story books, introduced me to horror. One story i remember being at the end of one of these books was about a ghost with bloody fingers that would stay in a hotel room closet. I remember it really well because at the end of the story theres no real scare or resolution. It had a comedic ending where the last resident in the story hears the ghost cry out and just tells him to get a bandaid. I remember being angry because unlike all of the other scary stories it just ended on a joke, like the ghost wasnt a real threat.

"While I don't necessarily agree with your take, I think it's cool because my personal takeaway from the movie was loss, grief, and denial. I experienced a huge loss in my family and I think that's why I read it that way; like Unsane, this movie played into something in me that made me very, very uncomfortable. I felt the loss and grief and I understood what felt like a drug-induced, hallucinated ending that almost felt like the main character dreaming away the problems in the movie. It all spoke to me in that way. 

That being said, I think we all read into movies in a way that's relative to us; for me, grief is a close feeling, and for you, it's transgender issues, so we read what we recognize in the movie. That's why I LOVE when people talk about their own interpretations; it's so neat to see what other people see in any piece of art.

"Unpopular opinion, I could not like this movie. It did so many things right, and it had a central conceit that I was absolutely in love with. It just could not sell me on the world as it was. I think it was how reasonable so much of the movie was and how carefully some details were handled that made me absolutely froth at the mouth when it failed so spectacularly on a few basic levels. A movie that features genuinely smart protagonists doing things that make sense to help their situation(laying sand, going around barefoot, learning sign language) just completely failed to make the world feel real.

Let me explain. In the same scene where the father makes another great move toward verisimilitude in hiding his sound under a waterfall, his grade-school age son makes an extremely piercing and mature observation about the emotional dynamic of the household. That kid should be sticking gum in his sister's hair, not wondering if she knows her father loves her. It was just unbelievable coming from that mouthpiece. I was hearing an uncle speak with the body of a child.

But honestly, the characters were handled very well aside from that and the family drama was perfectly serviceable in spite of how surreal that kid was. No, what killed this movie for me was the monsters. Put simply, they did not make sense. Absolutely nothing about them even began to parse as reasonable. It's a horror movie, I'm not asking for the monsters to be meticulously explained. I don't mind that these guys managed to turn the world into dystopia and that they can't be killed even by tank rounds and anti-armor missiles. I also don't mind them being able to rend sheet metal with no difficulty. Weird, but not the craziest thing in a horror movie. What I mind is that they apparently emit a sound that stuns themselves. What? How could that even? Please, just what? They literally produce a sound, that when sent back to them causes physical pain. I almost accepted this as the reason why we never see more than one in the same place, until I remembered that we did. Twice. Once when they killed the old, suicidal man in the woods, and once at the end when they were seen on CCTV cameras swarming the farm.

Still, not done with these things being nonsensical. The entire movie sets them up as invincible angels of death, armored beyond our ability to damage them. Then one dies to a shotgun shell in the face. The movie asks us to genuinely believe that no one tried to shoot one in the face before now, with the least penetrative weapon imaginable. It gives us the 'they're weak to sonic attacks! Get it? Sound! That's our theme.' then shows us that the sound thing doesn't actually kill them, bullets do. These things drove the entire world into fear and anarchy despite being able to be shot to death like literally anything else. I refuse.

Ah, and the last reason why these monsters bother me. The scene in the root cellar was madness. I loved the idea of a hidden area underground covered in a mattress so that they could finally make sound safely away from the monsters. Again, lovely way to show us that the heroes are smart people taking steps to improve their world through careful thought and ingenuity. Love it. But a monster just gets in. Seriously. No explanation, there's just one of them in there. It just walks out of a shadowy area. Maybe the people who thought of this whole idea just forgot to check the entire complex that they dug for other entrances. Or maybe it was just down there for years and just now woke up. But wait, they made a ton of sound just a few minutes ago. If it was down there the whole time, it would have attacked. So clearly it found a way into an underground complex with exactly one entrance that was already covered. Great work, writers. Oh, right. It also goes underwater because it doesn't need to breathe for some reason. It has no need to sink into two foot deep water. We have never been shown that these things like to crouch or crawl. It's just done because not being able to see them is scarier. I absolutely hate these things and how hideously inconsistent and unreasonable they are. It totally ruins an otherwise excellent movie. You just have to accept that the monsters are made of applied plot and their every action is guided by the invisible hand of lazy writing.

Go watch it, just understand that this single detail took it from a world worth thinking about to just another popcorn horror movie.",1,0,2018-07-08T17:33:48.000Z,Austin Kreulach,UC1tmAV8W0NX4W-vPO5xhAgw,XlaZJDhb1es,True,UgxiqnV9VZlD1TVBRQR4AaABAg

"Definitely the most original take I've seen yet, and your points really make sense! I wanted to know what you thought about the age differences between Charlie and Peter. According to how you see the movie, what is the true age of Charlie/Peter? I feel like from your interpretation, Charlie's younger age can be taken as the time period in her life when she started to feel like she didn't belong in a female body. From what I remember, Charlie was 13, which is smack dab in the heart of puberty. Forgive me if I'm assuming, but I feel as though this is a prime age for young people to start coming to terms with the fact that they don't belong in their gender assigned by birth.

I also think that it's interesting to see that the grandma's demon possession plans occur right around the time Peter is showing romantic interest in a female classmate. The fact that Peter hides where he's going (to that girl's party rather than a school dinner idk I forgot exactly what it was) might mean that he would be ashamed to admit to his mom that he likes a girl, as he has not come out to his mom yet. I know that being a trans boy does not mean that you like girls, so I'm not completely sold on this idea, but it would fit the narrative in this case. Charlie dies after he goes to this party, and that might be because Peter is finally ready to admit to his mom that he isn't a girl anymore. 

I hope you're able to figure out what I'm saying lawl I'm very bad at articulating my thoughts.",1,0,2018-07-07T02:04:10.000Z,Janice Peregrina,UClLDSga7jeGMYpjG76hTUOg,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgyY3fnrgg7HgnzPYCh4AaABAg
"A jump scare CAN work, there are caveats to it though, you only get one, perhaps two to work with in a movie before it loses it's effect, and it also is something that need be earned.  An example off the top of my head is the first (well, first main character) death in Halloween.  We have a long scene with Annie Brackett moving about, being stalked by Michael, she has a whole series of false starts where we expect a shock (going to wash her clothes for example when she spills butter, being locked in that...outhouse washer room and so on) but the tension hangs.  A whole half the film of Michael being built up by Loomis, hanging about in the background and so on and then finally something like 45 or 50 minutes in we get the sting with her in the car and Mike pouncing from behind and strangling her.  

It's a Lewton bus but the film works because it doesn't milk the notion, we only get that and, if memory serves one with the one boyfriend later on and that's that.  It functions because it's a break in tension, the whole film is this slow and then faster build to tension so those small moments are a payoff for that patience.  People have lost sight of that and simply toss them in now willy nilly so they become cheap jumps without putting in the effort to make them actually work which is a shame because it's a solid technique, it's just been lost sight of what it's a technique FOR.  Not to be gross, but it's similar to the difference between an hour long lovemaking session and a two minute handjob...the end result is the same but the entire experience is qualitatively different...yeah, I know lol, it was the simplest comparison I could think of...",0,0,2018-07-07T01:33:43.000Z,Andrew Hussey,UCA8f0VfZ0Zs8UPWB7s1Tnrw,__fxBha_1N4,True,Ugw_tshwwtl8VGnjF494AaABAg

"This is a really interesting take on the movie! It's cool that you mention that her dioramas are her ways of rationalising/metaphorically posing things that have happened in her life because that seems like something that's sort of obvious when you look at the scenes she makes of her mum (i.e. her in bed with baby Charlie and her mother offering her breast to breastfeed Charlie - indoctrinating or influencing her daughter from her perspective), but you sort of think that the accident scene is literal because that's what you JUST saw in the movie. But it totally makes sense that it wouldn't necessarily be literal and would be how she viewed a particular event. I remember an interesting detail that someone mentioned that supports the framing through the dollhouse idea is how the headless mother just floats up to the tree house at the end, like she's a doll being moved by someone outside. I'd really like to look more into the lore on Paimon because I'd be real interested to see how they intersect (especially with your take). The way this movie dealt with grief was amazing.

"I don't think it was about time itself, but the ghost's relationship with time. It doesn't matter if a nuclear apocalypse happens or if a Red Giant consumes Earth -- what matters is that she's dead, he's dead, and he's left wandering something that has no relation to him. It's purposeful that he can't even hear the boardroom (and doesn't explore anything further -- it had no point other than the one it made).
He disappeared from the note, but I mean, does that necessarily point to contentment? The other disappearance we saw was when the flower-ghost finally realised that she was never going to meet 'them' again. Is that a fulfilling end? Maybe the note represents something futile and ridiculous-- something tiny in the face of something huge and relentless, and not in a nice way. Something which is demolished by a fucking excavator, and which dies with somebody who immediately ceases to exist afterward. This is... nihilistic.
The constriction of the picture. Maybe it was just me, but it filled me with a lot of anxiety and dread. I think it illustrates how tiny our views are, how small the world is, and the disconnect that everyone should inevitably feel with the world around them, considering the philosophy the movie presents.

It's probably a lot cheesier than I thought it was, but, I also watched a woman eat pie for a ... long time. And that seemed to be, you know, trying to say *something*. I guess.
IDK, on second thought, maybe they could've quelled some of my doubts about the film by showing the ghost in an apocalyptic wasteland.

Look at the way they handled his death:
*long shot
*closer shot of car crash
*close-up of dead body 
*fade to morgue
like -- what? that was p. alright. I guess moments like that aren't going to matter unless we see the romantic, cheesy stuff, but at the same time... I think where the movie was cool was how that note was ripped away from him (something which I thought was portrayed as something which didn't matter, but which he cared immensely for anyway), the house was destroyed, and a ghost was like ""this ain't fucking worth it"" and outted.

"The 1980's (and well into the 90's) were an interesting time for punk because a lot of things - particularly in the hardcore punk sub-genre - were ad-hoc and decisions were made in a very sudden manner so a band like ""Black Flag"" that had Anarchist, Left-leaning aesthetics or Minor Threat which was even more-so in that ball park could easily find themselves playing a complete skinhead divebar and for a while in the early to mid-eighties the neo-nazis really took over the 'skinhead' look and style and were really infecting the punk scene in a lot of towns so it's interesting to see a tour ""horrorshow"" like this play out - and then ramped up to an absolutely extreme level. The Dead Kennedys actually got so fed up with Nazis crashing their gigs that they wrote the song ""Nazi Punks Fuck Off"" - which I think they released as a single, to really send the message home. It was an interesting time for punk because it INCREDIBLY diverse and disparate not only in the music itself but in the people playing the music and this fueled the violence that was part of the 'punk' experience when you went to a show - and that was seamlessly adopted by metal music nowadays.

Idk what sorta punk shows you've been to, but I've seen a lot of violence that ran the gambit to 'fun' like you say to 'I think we should call the police but then they'll wreck the show and we'll never play here again.'

"Okay, I'm at 17:43, just finished the recap. Before we continue:

That final chase sequence is SO GOOD. I think a lot of it comes from the fact that most of the film up to that point comes across as kinda cliche (yes, I know it created or popularized many of those cliches, but roll with me here), with lots of corny dialogue and ""oooo, spooky!"" stuff. It feels very much like a ""movie"". But when Laurie finds the room full of her dead friends and then Michael just starts bearing down on her, with minimal dialogue from anyone in the scene, the relentless soundtrack, Michael flailing his arms through that closet to grab at her especially...it suddenly feels very real. Because I suppose in real life, you wouldn't consider the backstory or intent of a man in a mask stomping towards you with a knife. Everything falls away and the only thought in both Laurie and the audience's mind is RUN.",0,0,2018-07-05T00:12:47.000Z,BlueScarabGuy,UCeBIF9LwWdpaUTKAuTmvaQQ,lwv3FsFj3_M,True,Ugx8eOUwmsjpBiBlODJ4AaABAg

"Honestly, I believe that the message of the Purge films is completely disingenuous. It's a half-assed attempt to morally distance oneself from the implications of the work, and to save face against criticism.
I suspected as much before I learned that the films are written and directed by the same person (James DeMonaco), but that effectively confirms it in my eyes.

"The story of the release of this film is so good too.  Was finished in 1994, bought by Columbia pictures in 1995, shelved for 2 years, meanwhile Henkel and Kuhn sued Columbia to attempt to get the rights because they felt Columbia was never going to release it.  Then, Columbia, Henkel AND Kuhn were ALL sued by Charles Grigson, a man who had obtained the rights to the original Chain Saw Massacre film.  All while Rene Zellweger and Matthew Mcconaughey became big stars(With Zellweger's role in Jerry Maguire, and Mcconaughey's first lead in A Time To Kill).  Also, reportedly as Mcconaughey got more popular, his agent put pressure on Columbia to not release the film in theaters, which could've been a possible reason for it being shelved for so long (Since A Time To Kill finished production in 1995).      It didnt come out until August 1997 a full 3 years after it was finished, and close to a year after both Zellweger and Mcconaughey's arguable breakout roles.",1,1,2018-07-04T17:53:49.000Z,Phished123,UCa9uVAxtcWbBaSZ4TOD2d4w,e_LdXW3tKG4,True,UgzfLh3TlElbAPSd9ol4AaABAg

"Super interesting take on the movie. A couple related thoughts, I don't think the mom interacts with the son at all until he asks to borrow the car to go to the party, in which case her immediate reaction is to make sure he brings his sister along. You could interpret that as the mother not acknowledging the male side of her daughter until she is suspicious something is up, where she then insists tries to fight it. She (maybe subconsciously, maybe in hindsight) knows something is up and is resistant to what's about to happen. Also interesting is the invite to the party the son's friend says something like ""Big party at so-and-so's house, be sure to bring your dick"".

One: it could be completely literal (I doubt that though). 

Two: The daughter really does die horrifically, but the rest of the movie is the mother trying to cope with the loss, and after that scene, the movie changes to the perspective of her miniatures and how she tells herself ""oh she couldn't have died for no reason theres got to be more to it"".

I think of this video, Kyle Kallgren's take, and MatPat's ""Was Thanos Right?"" video as a trilogy that explores different aspects of Thanos' portrayal - Kyle hit the philosophical implications of his goals, Matt hit the economic and scientific theory behind Thanos plan and whether it would work (despite the title of the video he basically decides it's unlikely it would work, at least in the long term, and if he's serious about this population control we're probably looking at periodic repeat mass killings), and you give an artistic analysis of the portrayal of Thanos as a character. And all of you hit on why the fan reaction made me feel so deeply uneasy, namely that this stuff doesn't exist in a vacuum.  As mentioned by both Matt and Kyle, people actually have attempted culls in real life, or at least believe that people (now and then they specify that they mean poor Africans which is really gross) should be allowed to die because resources. (I've encountered the latter in my adventures on the Internet and it always makes me feel sick.) The fact that so many people think that would be okay just because it would be random instead of based on some kind of racial bias is insanely disturbing ... and where I think the artistic interpretation comes in, is I think you're right in pointing out that there's a certain weakness in the way the audience is supposed to connect to Thanos / understand him, yet so many people feel they do. I feel like a lot of people are projecting into him and I wonder WHAT they are projecting, given how ... insanely disturbing that is. Like with other villains I understand what people see in them even though they're awful people, but like you I just don't get it with Thanos. Maybe that's us, maybe that's just my bias because of previously mentioned encounters with people that really have this kind of view. I kind of wish I understood more about what people are thinking here because I think it would be an insight to society in general, but then again maybe it's a void I don't particularly want to stare into.

So anyway you're probably not gonna read this because of people being aholes about your gender identity in the comments but on the off chance you do thanks for helping put my finger on the unease.",0,0,2018-06-26T04:53:46.000Z,TimeTravelerJessica,UCgPSrNbv885r1D70L2OjAFA,kGBXTfiJLYU,True,Ugwcgj4xgS74gZ62ZAB4AaABAg
"As soon as you were talking about the daughter's soul being in the son's body I was wondering if it might have some kind of trans interpretation. This is a really fascinating interpretation ... if I see the film (probably won't because I am a big ole wuss who gets scared by far less scary movies) I'll definitely keep this reading in mind. 

Did you go outside and look for the baby noise?! That was creepy! Like if you didn't that was probably a wise choice, like for real there has been at least one serial killer that used recordings of a baby crying to lure people to their death (unless that is an urban legend). I lived in Texas all my life until a couple of years ago and never heard anything like that!!!

"I can totally understand where you're coming from. I think the movie is open to interpretation in a lot of ways. It all depends on who watches it I think. I do agree that is all in her interpretation if real events. More than the opening shot there are other ways to tell that it's all through the lens of her art. There are several shots in tilt-shift that make locations appear to be her miniatures several times throughout the movie as if to remind us that it is all still in her interpretation of the world. 
    Personally, despite it being a bit cliche, I interpreted it through the lens of my experiences of mental illness to be about mental illness and how if it isn't spoken about and hidden it can tear people apart. For a very long time I hid my mental illness and suicidal ideations from my family. That is until it started just ripping me a new one. I started to get very sick as a result of my severe anxiety. The fact that I didn't speak about it with my family and get support was what was the most harmful part. 
     Now of course I can't even begin to speculate on the nature of what is going on with her, but there was a triggering incident where it came to the point of her having a choice to speak about it with her family or not. Obviously she hid it and all the ways she tried to cope on her own stacked up and stacked up until things fell apart. What happens to each of her family members is kind of how her problems interfere with her relationship with each one. 
     From there I interpreted the support group to be how she is managing her problems on her own and eventually that is what eventually causes everything to fall completely apart. The art pieces are how this manifests I think. When her husband comes across her making a diorama of how she interprets her relationship with her daughter it is met with disgust. This happened with me when i would make my art. Sometimes themes are disturbing and people didn't know me would be put off by it. It's because they didn't know how I was expressing myself and only saw it objectively. 
     Now for myself, once I told my family what was going on with me and got professional help I feel that it's brought me closer to my family in general. However for the mom she made the choice to keep that part of herself secret from the people who love her the most and so it ultimately severed her from them. Now family is kind of a loose thing for me. Of course some people can't trust their blood family and can't tell them what's going on; I understand that. What I mean by telling and communicating with ""family"" about your problems is the people closest to you in life. The people who truly love you for who you are.",0,0,2018-06-25T20:16:21.000Z,bleachsanchoblastk,UCiOPMG6G4VIPrldpxHCNohA,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgzhYEIKhfkcP2dxmkJ4AaABAg

Loved this movie. Sam Raimi's movie shooting style is awesome. Darkman is an interesting Raimi movie to look back on now.   Its easy to spot a movie that Raimi did just from watching it. His style is so individual and original.  In Darkman liam Neeson's movements and physical actions within the film kind of remind you of Ash in the Evil Dead films.

"Very interesting take! I honestly didn‚Äôt like the ending of the movie when I first watched it because I felt like it demystified the entire ordeal. But upon listening to your interpretation, I think the ending makes way more sense. The treehouse was Charlie‚Äôs refuge, and to the mother, her refuge when dealing with the loss of Charlie. The cult leading the son into the treehouse signified that the mother‚Äôs last area of comfort for dealing with Charlie had been taken over by the demon. Charlie had finally transitioned.

The connection to Paemon that is important (and this is just my interpretation), is that Paemon represents financial wealth, but since the Grandmother was wealthy, and loved Charlie, the financial wealth equates to love and support. The mother sees Charlie‚Äôs transition as wrong, and is jealous of the Grandma heaping love and affection on Charlie instead of her.",0,0,2018-06-24T21:27:19.000Z,Goldarlives,UCLpTTCTC1jG0ul_KC6_K5iw,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgzKeuRSaCttTsCETYJ4AaABAg

"I loved your analysis. I didn‚Äôt see the movie. I have no allegiance to lgbtq promotion but it was a beautiful metaphor. Regardless of weather it is the real true nature of the story. I felt like your interpretation of the narrative was beautiful and deep. Nearly everybody ends up disappointing their parents in some way and the guilt, shame and power struggle of control vs validation is in my opinion the birth of individuality. Having to disconnect from deification of parents into believing in oneself, is a heretical experience. It makes sense that the maturity of a trans person would be disconnection and finally integration of the child proto-personality. Even if it makes you a demon you have to be oneself and separate from the moral expectations of others. Then, the keeping skeletons hidden in plain sight. I disagree about bringing the daughter back being the problem, that‚Äôs the mothers grieving process, you can‚Äôt simply let go of the people you love, you have to admit you have lost them, denial and refusal of defeat of your identity as a person who is connected and in love is the momentum of love. You can‚Äôt simply accept because emotions are based in your assumptions about who you are and your place in the world. If someone you love changed, you lose your life in the process, the refusal to move on only shows how much she loved her daughter. If she had zero insight into her inner masculinity then the lack of continuity would be impossible to overcome directly. You would have to look back and relearn your whole existence, we lean on each other to establish ourselves, this is why loneliness terrifies many people. Being self defining without context is impossible. Those that do define themselves without reference do so from a confidence in therir own truth, most people don‚Äôt have their own truth, they have context. It‚Äôs very mystical to be ones own context. Point being a mother may only know herself as a mother to a daughter and the loss of that context would be an attack on her soul, as you said the daughter has no choice she has to be the young man she or he knows himself to be but that does not imbue others with the ability to process the loss of everything they know. You must fight for what you love not out of any duty but because you are cursed to if you have no independence. She knows herself through her family she knows no identity of her own.

"I find it interesting that in no point of the movie do we see cops, ambulances, doctors, or any other type of authority that ""helps"".

While we do see the group therapy meetings, the fact that it was done in secret, and stopped after a single shown meeting makes me think it it might mean something. We also see teachers, (and I'm pretty sure the father was a professor) but they were always shown to be baffled, and pretty oblivious.

The thing that really made me think this way is that while we were told of the medium, we were never shown their face, not even a name. Exactly why? It wouldn't be that hard to get a cultist or two to pretend. I feel like it means something, especially since mediums are essentially the guide to a seance.",0,0,2018-06-24T06:17:47.000Z,Twister,UCVgEXVWdgkHCJbmseSNNkKw,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgyEiOCi4Y15TNq9-hd4AaABAg

"That is a really interesting interpretation of the movie, and perhaps a deeper cut that I was reading in. My interpretation appears to be the common one you were not such a fan of with mental illness, and I don't think you saying it is too obvious should disqualify it.

One of my main thoughts is a connection of what was being talked about in the classroom, about the tragedy of control, in that it can be all the worse to struggle despite there being none, that the grandmother was mentioned of having a trait of mental illness, and the mother's increasing erratic behaviour in the movie that she seems confused that someone like her husband is pointing it as a problem. Pretty much that her mother had a hereditary mental illness, which she found traumatizing and tried to run away from, and regardless of how much she fought, the same was to happen to her. All the missing heads thing, the fact she did not want to bring a child into it, and a rotting corpse as a representation of the disease in the attic, trying to run away or ignore it does not help, and destroys the family. In the end, the son will also inherit it.

One of the things I could not quite find good explanations of, might be Charlie and her death, and the wrinkle for it just being discrediting it then for your interpretation about it being gender change, is that the mother herself had a brother who died when she was younger. You have to either ignore that, or ask questions if she went through her own change, or perhaps something like her mother was trying to make her a boy, and this be why she would not like her getting involved with a daughter. An interpretation I can perhaps reach is of Charlie just being the innocence of Peter, as her brother was for herself. Her innocence was broken by the mother forcing all the crazy schizophrenic delusions onto her, while Peter's was not, but a little strange, and the innocence could in a sense resurface through something like exploiting the mental illness, which perhaps was what the grandmother was like in her later years.",1,0,2018-06-24T05:48:55.000Z,DuskyPredator,UCEYCu-dnNLO_0hASjYyZ_mg,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,Ugwv0DuPGbMIBHTjtNF4AaABAg

"The way the opening/miniature shots made me view the film, was kinda like a voyeuristic lens. We begin with a zoom into a miniature version of the house, almost like looking into a dollhouse. Children play with those to make up stories and be entertained with right? Yet by contrast there's nothing fun about this ""dollhouse"" the characters live in. There's horrific things happening again and again throughout the film. It makes me feel like the film wants to remind the audience it's viewing a horrific family tragedy for entertainment. There's nothing wrong with doing so, I mean almost every film can be boiled down to ""viewing conflict for entertainment."" But since this film reminds the audience it's being viewed through a miniature, it spurs me to think, ""hey, actual families go through tragedies. it's not just a thing that happens on film.""",1,0,2018-06-24T03:07:31.000Z,Geoffrey g,UCa8R5hbvwJoK4gT9ILChJcA,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgyrDc5NXAu3r_7giNB4AaABAg

"Ohhhh my god thank you for making this! I went into this movie fully intent on a disability reading and came out shaken and wondering wtf was happening with gender. Because the movie was so intense, I missed a lot of details, but one thing that struck me was that both Charlie and the mom create miniature people. The mom's so closely resemble the family members that it can be difficult in some shots to determine if we are looking at people or models. Charlie's are made of sticks and found items and only resemble the Paimon figure at the end (whose arm is raised like Peter's in the classroom scene). So we start and end with two images that combine the miniature art and the film scene, but by the end, the people are resembling Charlie's models, not the other way around--which seems to fit your analysis pretty well.",1,0,2018-06-23T23:27:00.000Z,totallynotbees,UCvejSbUjlFOfdsP_vBbpP0A,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgzlwLXOkVzeKE9Osqh4AaABAg

"I wonder about the art of Toni Colette's character. The art work itself and the integration in the movie is impressive, yes. But I wonder, if the work on the minitures is really something that helps her dealing with her life. In my opinion, the rebuilding of important biographical scenes draw her even more into her family's past. On the other hand, a lot seem too perfectionistic and brittle to be really heart felt.( Well, of course there is more than one kind of art and taste, but it seems very distanced to me. What is maybe suposed if you see Annie in the grief group meeting who tells first, she would feel better to not say anything at all- and then monologes on and on.)

In another analysis someone said, the opening scene shows that the family are for the mother and the demons nothing more then little toys to play with whole fate is already decided. Maybe it's in this meaning empowering to rebuilding and downsize (traumic) scenes to the artist. But she seems often ( always when the exhibition is mentioned) not very satisfied with her work. Maybe, because she gets conscious that she made a living recreating her history again and again, something she wanted to come away? 
In comparison, Charlie does weird little sculptures, too, but her work seems more organic and free from all boundaires to please an audience or sell something. Annie seems to struggle more with her work. And when she creates impulsively the modell of Charlie' s accident and seems much nearer to her own needs, she immediately gets an repulsive, worried reaction of her husband, who supported her work before (as long it was clean and resonable, not an emotional expression).",2,3,2018-06-23T21:23:26.000Z,Mara,UCt9CKRof_ZBe-Mmwv8wXjmQ,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgyH9hRWK5A3_P-ZZOh4AaABAg

"I love to see your interpretation, all the things I red or watched about the movie left me a bit unsatisfied. 
To my own thoughts: You mentioned ""The Witch"", well that was a thing that made the ending not work for me. In ""The Witch"", the ending with the dialog with Black Philipp and the awakening scene with the group of women around the fire is an emanzipation. The girl embraces the insult and becomes more powerfull. After all the killing and death scenes of her family members, it is at least in this way an inprovement for the heroine.
I was surprised that the ending scene here mirrors or immitates this scene, you have also here an off scene voice which tells the changes. But different from Thomasin, Peter can't be more away from becoming himself. I don't think, movies especially horror movies have to end on an happy note.

I've struggled with mental illness for years, and the scene with the mother trying to get the father to believe what she was saying about the sketchbook and the cult really struck a chord with me. I'm sure mental illness is the more surface level interpretation, but some of the moments were eerily similar to my own problems. I have a friend who believes it's about abuse and the struggle to get out of the cycle, because that's what she is familiar with. Perhaps that's what makes this film so good, there is room for many different interpretations, and all have pretty solid reasoning behind them.

"Charlie isn‚Äôt in the son. The demon was in Charlie. So the fact that Charlie is said to be in the son means that it‚Äôs the demon inside him, not the little girl. This is supported by the fact that the grandma says it needs a strong male vessel instead of a weak female one. It also explains why Charlie is a little bit fucked up and does creepy stuff. Also the fact that the grandma and Charlie were close shows that she could‚Äôve easily on the ritual on her. This makes sense because at the start Toni Collettes character says her brother committed suicide, blaming her mother for trying to put people inside him. This shows that her mother has done it before and could‚Äôve easily done that to Charlie and because Charlie is younger, she wouldn‚Äôt have objected in anyway. While I find your take on it interesting, I kind of disagree with you about the transgender take. I think the movie actually happens. I guess the only flaw is the one I‚Äôve mentioned above.

"First of all. Love ya, Nyx. Great talk. I truly enjoy these critical thinking and analysis videos and keep up the great work.
      It seems like the writer must have known someone personally that consistently ""plays the victim"" instead of giving a wholehearted apology, owning up to their own shortcomings or just saying they were wrong. There's even an entire scene expressing that character flaw where the mother projects her guilt on to her son Peter, calling him out for not taking responsibility for his actions and does so in a very emotionally manipulative way. Peter even claps back at his mother about it, accusing her of forcing Charlie to go to the party with him and his mother just swallows that truth like a hand full of rock salt then snaps at her husband when he tells them to stop tearing each other down. Thankfully, the dialogue in this exchange is a tiny more subtle than that. ...or is it? ...doesn't matter...
This scene is truly amazing in how grounded it is; it's very relatable. We know someone like this, have seen someone doing this or have done it ourselves. Moreover, the acting in this scene sells these feelings of displaced guilt, frustration and resent.
More important than being relatable, this scene is also a blatant turning point in the movie. Added to the death of her daughter, this exchange has definitively changed the dynamic of the family as well as her ability to cope. If the tragedies leading up to this were like pouring paint thinner on a painting of a happy family this exchange drops a lit match to it. All the audience can do now is watch it burn. and... pff...

YOUR VIDEO CLEANSED MY SOUL OF ALL THE DOUBTS I HAD ABOUT MY INTERPRETATION.

The literal and the figurative. I was sure of this because of the way the settings were constantly filmed as though they were miniatures and the fact that there were certain shots and scenes that didn't completely align with any one interpretation. IMAGINE MY FREAKIN' SURPRISE when NO ONE is talking about the film complexly and only discussing the linear plot as if that's all there is to the film! I thought I was going crazy thinking that there was more to the picture. You never disappoint in any of your videos and in this one you managed to completely articulate my frustration and bewilderment surrounding the discussion of this film as a literal narrative while introducing entirely new points and concepts that I hadn't even thought of

"I wasn't sure how I felt about it but when you first dropped the take, but this actually makes the film so much more interesting to me. It really does reflect what its like to come out as trans. My parents were mostly supportive of me, but my mom expressed to me that she felt like her daughter had died. And after I told her, she told me she'd need time to process it. It took 3 days before she got back to me, as if I told her a loved one had died. And both my parents, despite making efforts to use my new name and pronouns still have a hard time letting go of the past. My mom repeatedly told me to try to see it from her perspective, how she had all these expectations and dreams for me and how it felt like they all crumbled when I told her - again, as if her daughter had died. 

If you view the movie through this lens, it reflects alot of really common experiences for trans people coming out to their families. Obviously its through an incredibly twisted perspective, but its still reflective nonetheless. 

Thanks for making this video! I love to see these kinds of deeper interpretations of movies that don't always take it literally. Keep up the great work!",19,0,2018-06-23T04:07:23.000Z,Thaddeus,UC2vFTimRsEUjRfYO8FpXnew,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,Ugz34P0qOJ8ajeL8uS94AaABAg

"Very good points, definitely agree with several points. 
Some thoughts from me. The doll house felt to me like Annie's brain as she was dealing with the trauma, full of rooms and doors to things she doesn't want to deal with. Her viewpoint of placing blame on everyone else but herself can be a totally natural reaction to grief, but it also reminded me of someone I know who happens to have borderline personality disorder, which I know you said felt too on the nose and surface level. Maybe it's because the Satanic cult reminded me of the child abuse hysteria of the 80s, but I also had this theory that Charlie was being abused by the grandmother, who had also abused Annie when she was a child.

"I haven't been affected by a horror movie like this, since I was a kid. It's such a gut-wrenching, uncomfortable experience. The fear didn't start sinking in, until the night AFTER I saw the movie. I'd go into the kitchen, and imagine someone standing in the darkness of the living room.

I honestly feel that (SPOILERS: DO NOT READ THIS, IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE) the misleading trailer made it even more traumatic. I went into Hereditary, fully expecting it to be about Charlie. Hell, they even released a second trailer, simply titled Charlie, full of click noises. So when that horrific moment happened, I was still thinking, ""No. She didn't die."" As Peter sat there, I slowly realized she did, and I waited for the reveal. But nope. No reveal. So I thought we would be spared from the reveal. But nope. We weren't, and it was 100 times more horrific. 

I can still hear Toni Collette screaming when she found her daughter's headless corpse, the look on Peter's face, in shock, stuck in that hellish moment. I can still hear her screaming, ""I want to die!"" and I can still see that girl's head, covered in ants. The mother, floating in the attic, slicing her own head off, the guy in the corner...this movie, indeed. The best way I can describe this movie is sleep paralysis. Two hours of sleep paralysis, with the most terrifying sounds and imagery forced inside of your head. Ari Aster somehow transmitted a nightmare into real life, and trapped it in film.

"My take on the opening of the film was that the zoom-in on the dollhouse was meant to show that the family were plaything to larger forces outside of their control. They were being toyed with the entire time. One of Charlie's habits was making strange toys/dolls out of garbage and the cult later used those toys in their rituals. In the first schoolroom scene, they talk about how in tragic stories there is nothing the characters can do to avoid their fate. It is inevitable. When the Mother character THINKS she has control, thinks she can just fix everything by burning the book, THAT is when the father dies and the movie goes bugnuts insane. The movie even ends on a life-sized version of one of her dollhouse tableau, with real human bodies used as the props. The Film ends with Peter (as Charlie/Paemon) being told the full story of what was done in his name and him looking on in utter bewilderment. Even the demon who you would think would be pulling the strings has no idea what was going on.

In the end, I think they are all inevitably consumed by this family tragedy that is bigger than they can handle. Annie becomes unstable, secretive, manipulative, cruel and headless; a literal mirror image of her mother. Peter loses himself completely to Charlie. The father is consumed by fire.

But that's all just my take. Yours makes just as much sense and is actually pretty brilliant. Great video.",1,0,2018-06-22T23:51:04.000Z,Tony Russo,UCwBR-Cj1jN5Fo649W_CVvzg,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,Ugzv1bSu5gCboCycNQt4AaABAg

"i'm extremely sensitive to gore, so at first i was like, there's absolutely no way i'm watching this. but after hearing your theory about it being a trans metaphor, and lining that up with my own experiences as a trans masculine person, i think i might brave the gore just to see for myself. coincidentally, decapitation was a theme in my own struggles as a trans person. it was a kind of way for me to express that i ""don't have a face,"" ie, the face i see every day isn't mine, so it would be easier if i could just... pop my own head off. this also had to do with deeper identity issues involving a whole lot of depersonalization, but it's interesting to me to see that parallel from my own life in what you described. 

everything you talked about, down to the son's feeling of ""maybe i really am still my mother's daughter, what if i'm lying to myself and i'm not what i say i am"" is something i've felt in my life, and sometimes still feel. as well as that, my best friend told me that when he came out as trans to HIS mother, she said that she felt like her daughter had died. she said that directly to him.

I was honestly thinking that Charlie literally transitioning was part of the film when I walked out but I honestly thought someone would call me out on it, but it made so much sense when I thought over it, even though my mom who I saw it with was singularly focused on figuring out the mother‚Äôs possession.

"It's so refreshing to see an interpretation of this movie outside of the 'simple' mental illness explanation.

"I FEEL SO VINDICATED.

After my boyfriend and I got out of the film and I had a good, long while to sit on it, I told him that based on the opening and closing scenes/images of the movie being focused on the dollhouses, I felt that those were meant to bookend the meat of the film, and were meant to be read as her art pieces.

He told me that I read too much into that, and that it was for style. I'm so glad that someone whose work I respect also came to the same conclusion.

Edit:  Oh my god, this discussion is helping to resolve my feelings on the film so much. I was incredibly frustrated with the ending when I was trying to force myself to read it literally. I loved the movie in general but I wasn't feeling the ending, but this is so cathartic to watch. And while I picked up on the trans themes, I didn't see how they tied into the dollhouse narrative until thinking of the film as an art piece describing the mother's grief over the ""death"" of her daughter.

*CUE ABSOLUTE TERROR*

What in god's name happened there? Is this video like, actually cursed? Did you get cursed by the raw energy of the fucking movie? Like, you bring up that raw, cosmic bomb of a scene and then THAT happens??? The shit?

Some notes to add about the video itself: the cultist that Charlie sees out in the field isn't really just some random cultist, but I'm certain is an apparition of the grandmother. I actually really like your interpretations of the film, and I picked up on some cues of that interpretation while watching. My own personal interpretation of the film is that it's about how the actions of the older generations of a family can, in a sense, determine the fate of the current generation. For example, the imagery of the grandmother being showered in money as a result of a ceremony that would end up dooming the family I can interpret as the grandmother sort of ""selling out"" in a sense.

Please figure out the baby thing, though I'm deeply concerned. Don't figure out the bagman, that can just stay right the fuck outta here.",0,0,2018-06-22T20:22:33.000Z,HyperThermal,UCrRSjiUeewACP3r3F2CZUvw,WGLDKVUJbkw,True,UgxjejX-gfYDI8Tj2dJ4AaABAg
"Before I start watching: I saw this movie yesterday and I'll say that while I enjoyed the movie for what it was, I absolutely loathed the ending and the direction it decided to take. It's possible your reading will change my mind, but what I got from the movie is that it was an abuse victim's panic spiral, and the ending through that lens is saying ""trying to grow beyond/in a way different to what's expected of you is pointless, you can never escape or rise above the damage done to you, so why bother trying?"" (if nothing else, this movie and now your video makes me want to make my own video about it, but eh, that probably won't happen)
After watching: A very interesting take! It's definitely softened my, uh, intense dislike of the ending, although it's something I had to have explained to me instead of seeing it myself initially, so I'm not... too sure how to feel?

"Your point about the power of abstraction reminds me of one of the biggest takeaways I got from Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics (stay with me!):
A character drawn in a realistic style is more alienating to the audience compared to a more simplistic, stylized one, because that's closer to how we actually experience ourselves. One doesn't *feel* one's own freckles or skin color or cheekbones in the moment. The more abstracted a character's design and expressions are, the easier they are to identify and empathize with. Realism doesn't actually help people connect, when it comes to emotional experiences.

You opened my eyes to a lot of things that were hiding in plain sight.

"i grew up on marvel comics and know the infinity arc pretty well and i agree with all your points. there was just so much wasted potential and not enough character development. especially for thanos. like, i get him in the comics but the movie version was just really boring and i couldn't empethize with him or actually understand his logic at all. and the scene where he killed gamora messed me up because there's just something really gross about seeing an abuse survivor get thrown into a pit to her death by her abuser after he went on about loving her and then being forced to watch him cry about it. also, as much as a few of the deaths pulled at my heartstrings, they didn't have the same impact as they would if we weren't guaranteed that this was all a doomed timeline. the only thing that got to me was that, i swear to god, i heard groot call rocket ""dad"" as he vanished and i'm pretty sure that was confirmed. 

(also, on the subject of thirsty thanos fans: my boyfriend has actually had a crush on him since he was a teenager. he likes buff villains so i figured the other thirsties were the same. it's basically like when everyone had a thing for loki but now it's all about big, buff, grape flavored josh brolin. but your theory is pretty sound because, again, it's just like pre-character development loki; genocidal but hot and complicated.)",0,0,2018-05-30T23:41:16.000Z,Erik Jones,UCxNP9f_TB7thpKGwf78_wsA,kGBXTfiJLYU,True,UgxhcQZFJcJ8XF1n3Wl4AaABAg

He even tells Gamora that her planet is thriving after he visited it. He's got this self-righteous martyr complex . Also he was sitting in Wakanda at the end of the movie probably because it was nearby.

Well I think he created that military force that the throne is a part of in order to gather the infinity stones and murder planets and now that his goals are seemingly accomplished he can just retire in peace as the most hated man in the galaxy.

"So,
The throne I see as a stand-in for the sword of Damascus and the burden of his cause. It is less that he feels like he is a ""King"" or what ever and more that he is charge with some great purpose. He has to do this, He has to be in this position of power for the good of those that will remain, Only He can lead them from there to prosperity.

As for the farm in the ending of the movie,  I see this more of a representation that his actions in the movie are like a farmer burning down part of his crops to allow the rest to thrive by the ashes *wink* fertilizing the soil. His motivation being that too much life getting stagnant and lives becoming less than what they are because so much competition, thus he razes the population to improve the life that remains.

The humanization parts are due to him being the villain protagonist of the film. His motives are ""pure"" to him at least and what he is doing isn't out of hate or disgust, just wanting to stop a worse fate to befall the rest. So making him feel more human and less monstrous is part of the lens of the movie painting Thanos as not a murderer but as some kind of tragic hero....

"Edit: OK found the credit its Wisecracks ""Predicting Avenger 4 with the Philosophy of A:IW"" video on IW If you want a better explanation I'd send you there way for a better understanding of Hickman's comic and the run that more greatly inspired IW and other MCU movies too.
End edit.


It deals less with the thematic elements of Gauntlet than it does the smaller comic which dealt with Deontology (the moral philosophy of duty based morals aka its our duty to good no matter what. Its been there a long time in Marvel and is shown best in in Caps ideology vs Starks. ""This isn't freedom its fear"", ""We cant sign away freedom or stand by when wrong is being done"", and finally ""We don't trade lives"".

This has been juxtaposed against Starks ideology, a consequenctialist view. So far its been Starks until IW in which its handed to Thanos. Its basically a view that the ends justify the means, collateral damage is OK if its for a greater cause, summed up well by ""The good of the many out weighs the good of the few"".

It was shown different times with Tony ala ""A metal shield encasing the world"", ""We need to be regulated and give freedom in order to save lives"", and now, with Thanos, ""Taking out half in order to allow half to flourish is worth the cost"".

Its been built up for a while now and helps the movie make more since. The video I saw explained far and away better than I was able to here. If you look at IW from the PoV of Gauntlet it doesn't make sense but if you take it from the more philosophical perspective of the smaller comic ("" we can't trade lives no matter what we have to do good as our duty no matter the consequences"").

 I think it makes a lot more sense and has better meaning and context particularly as compared to the MCU whole and what it's been building to over the years. Especially if it does hinge on Tony next movie him changing his world view and taking on the gauntlet would make a lot of sense and be a more fitting close to the current era of the MCU as a whole.

Edit: Also took me a minute to remember, also pointed out in Wisecracks video, was that a big point in Infinity War was StarLord and Dr. Strange both trade lives and its purposefully made meaningless and empty, further emphasing that ""Trading lives"" is wrong and that they were choosing incorrectly.",0,0,2018-05-28T18:54:50.000Z,C.T.

"So just kinda want to throw some clarification out here to those that are dropping in to tell me how wrong I am and explain the movie I saw to me. I don't think you are wrong, matter of fact you're all super right. But this is also where my disconnect lies. Yes Thanos explains his motivations to us directly, yeah Gamora and Thanos are given dialogue about their relationship and we see their first meeting, but this is the thing that I really have an issue with. Dramatization -- We are led to empathize and understand Thanos in the film, but are not given any emotional context for how he must have felt growing up, what (on an emotional level) led him to subscribe to an ideology that required that he kill half the population. Yes all that stuff is there and it's textually explained, but quite a bit of it is in hidsight to the scene with Gamora in question (a lot of the info dumping comes after she's long dead) and from what I gather much of Thanos's past and emotional development was cut from the film, around 15 minutes of screentime, and I believe strongly that the added character context would have promoted a stronger emotional understanding of his character, his motivations along with his character flaws and how that ultimately took him down the road that it did. His goals are all made blatantly tangible, but his internal emotional motivations are left vague (perhaps intentionally) because it's something to be 'revealed' and not something for the audience to grapple with in context of each scene. The next film is more than likely going to develop on this quite a bit, but my criticism is that these things are not dramatized here and I wish they were as it would have made me better connect with the story and what the film was actively trying to say.",105,4,2018-05-28T17:05:01.000Z,Nyx Fears,UCGC3ocH2v8O7elbGwGKdaBQ,kGBXTfiJLYU,True,UgwaF7yN79s2hn3g7at4AaABAg

"I think the entire argument of 'why' when it comes to Thanos and is motivation is simply one of ego, I honestly don't think they needed to spell that out. He has a tremendously fucked up logic to things but, as we know, real world history has countless people from the historically influential to just average people in the populace that develop and convince themselves in their own effed up logic. As Thanos says himself he's ""the only one with the will to do it"". An even better moment in my opinion comes when Peter Quill starts attacking Thanos in rage; moments before he shouts if it's true he killed Gomorrah and Thanos replies ""I had to"". I think the film is even asking and drawing attention to the same flawed logic you're describing here when Peter replies ""No you didn't"" (my favourite delivered line in the the film).

"Hi Nyx. I doubt this will be read but if you do I hope to clear things up a bit.

Thanos going from powerful to peaceful is comparable to the idea of the US President. They are the most powerful person on the planet for 4 - 8 years, but many look forward to the day they can retire. They don't wield power for power's sake. They do it achieve a goal. Thanos sees himself as that (rightly or wrongly). He believes his ends justify the means, but to obtain the means he has to be powerful enough to achieve it. Originally he went from planet to planet doing it manual, but he decided 'This takes too long, I need something quicker'. Once his aim is achieved he has no desire to 'Rule' forever. It was a means to an end. Once it is done he can retire in the 'better world' he created.

Also Thanos considers himself above morality. The reason why he can slaughter half the universe but love his daugther is the same logic to why the Nazis were often great family men after coming home from signing the deaths thousands. To paraphrase a famous Russian - 'A single death is a tragedy, a thousand is just a statistic'. Thanos saw a poor little child and decided to spare her. Raising her he grew to love her. If not like a daughter, maybe like a pet. Few would slaughter their dog unless the situation was dire.

I know from some angles it doesn't makes sense but in my head it maps out. I could be wrong though.",0,0,2018-05-28T08:41:11.000Z,Volastern Masq,UCW24lK73d33icXFTJbI8mTg,kGBXTfiJLYU,True,UgyT_4UeQNQ-fn45n-V4AaABAg

"Welp, you had questions, and I have answers:

- why does Thanos think that *he* is the one who has to save the universe from over-population?
Because he's the only one with the will to do it. No one else will do it, because the price is too high. If Thanos won't do it, no one will do it. And it NEEDS to be done. Thanos literally says all that.

- Why doesn't he just use the gauntlet to create more resources? 
The movie never delves into the question of that alternate course of action, so we're forced to assume that it's impossible (because you can't create something from nothing, maybe? I don't know, I sucked in physics in high school). You might claim that it's a plot hole, but it does NOT mean that Thanos just wants to kill people. It's obvious that killing people was never Thanos' goal - if it was, then he wouldn't have shown mercy so many times during the film.

- Why does Thanos love Gamora?
Because she's a fighter. He literally says that when he first meets her. She's everything that Thanos admires in people - strong, and generous, and iron-willed (he also admires those qualities in Peter Quill and Tony Stark, in this film).",4,0,2018-05-28T07:45:52.000Z,Guy R,UC5VCQS5ARZWcof1kt4aXHJg,kGBXTfiJLYU,True,UgzwLW_80zxLlgIj-2h4AaABAg

Thanos motivation to destroy half the universe was fact his home planet got destroyed. Because of limited resources.

"And while I did enjoy Infinity war very much, it pales in comparison with the original Infinity Gauntlet story. His motivation in the movie was fine, but his plan makes absolutely no sense. There are many other ways to solve the resource problems that doesn't involve killing everyone (as you said). Plus what happens when the remaining population continue to reproduce at the rate that they were, and overpopulation becomes an issue again. Dude basically said he was retiring after the snap.
His motivation in Infinity Gauntlet is weird for general audiences, but it would've been so much better for the film. Thanos killing half of all sentient life as a way to escape the friendzone would've been a lot of fun onscreen.

So yeah, I agree with all of your points and questions. I did enjoy the film, but was ultimately disappointed with the route they chose for the story. They should've continued to build Thanos slowly in all of the post-credit scenes instead of goofy shit like the Captain America thing in ""Spider-Man Homecoming"" or whatever that scene was with Thor and Jane Foster kissing in ""Thor: The Dark World.""

"Hi May!  So in response to the segment where you were talking about Thanos's motivations being unclear (the throne vs the farm, etc) and being unsure whether you were reading the situation correctly due to not having read many comics, I (a big dumb comics nerd) wanted to offer a helpful tidbit.  In Marvel canon, there are multiple ""universes"", each containing their own version of the same sets of characters.  So, for example, each universe has it's own Iron Man, but in one universe he'll be a playboy billionaire arms dealer, while in another universe he's a blue mutant child with superpowers (no really, this was an actual comic and it was WILD).  Each universe has it's own overarching plotline and the different universes rarely overlap.  The movies are referred to as the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" for a reason- they're considered their own universe with their own canon that is entirely separate from any of the comics universes.  

So, tldr, you don't need to know the comic lore to understand the movie characters because the movies don't even take place in the same universe as the comics, and Movie Thanos is not the same person as Comics Thanos.  Totally their own thing.

"Great video!
About the movie, I agree with much of what you are saying here.
I get what the movie was getting at, it was going for some story about ""trading lives"", with Captain America refusing to trade The Vision's life for preventing Thanos's plans to succeed, while Thanos wants to trade 50% of the lives of the universe for some vague overpopulation problem. But I dont feel the movie presented these two ideas well. I didnt realize this is what they were getting at until way after seeing it, its like that message was drowned out in the noise of the movie, so it felt like it only vaguely had a point. Thanos's point was vague like you explained, and how that idea related to him as a character felt vague too, being mostly revealed just by showing some ruins on his home planet. But they couldnt dedicate even more of the movie to his own perspective, since the movie was already so loaded with other characters that needed limelight. Its difficult to make clear points in a movie like this I suppose.",0,0,2018-05-27T21:49:35.000Z,FrankieSmileShow,UCPmHknS_745ujhqQNim-U-g,kGBXTfiJLYU,True,UgzSChPnfVM9o84aEsl4AaABAg
"Ok, so I'm going to throw my critique into the ring.
So first off, love your videos Nyx! Regarding primarily the first half of your video, that being Thanos' intentions. I felt he made it very clear why the ""suppression"" of half the population would help the universe. Taking the real life US as an example, the explosion of population was primarily caused by the lack of medical advancements and death rates actually being as high as they were turning into present day where we have the tech and medicine that we have currently. Due to people not dying nearly quick enough, we started filling up quickly, but as of recent years the birthrate in the US has plateaued and is now decreasing rapidly. Recent population scientist have actually speculated (in an especially satirical sort of way) that if our population was cut significantly while retaining all of our technological and medical advancements, that it would do immeasurable good to our resource growth and a whole host of other factors that would be impacted by such a shift. I'm just saying his reasoning hypothetically checks out though the film makers did not do a good job at helping the audience realize the extent of the infinity gauntlets power / just what Thanos could actually accomplish (maybe to the infinity gauntlet, killing half of everything is a piece of cake, but producing a burger out of thin air is a wild stretch).
The other point I want to address is Thanos' throne and his love for Gamora.
Why does Thanos have a throne? Well to me, it was because Thanos' study of the infinity stones and the use of them to complete his goal of cutting back on... well... all living beings was a more recent endeavor. Whereas before he took it son himself to kill 50% of whole planets (something it seems like he would need his whole army), once that fateful day of learning what the infinity stones could do, he flipped all his resources to finding them. That point, I believe, is backed up by the showing of Gamora's home world being genocide-ed. A second thread I believe that scene was meant to reaffirm was his love for Gamora.
So asking why a parent loves their child is tricky. I'm not saying it was the strongest scene by any means, but I do think it was, at very least, meant to show that he saw she was a fighter, sympathized with her, and wanted to shield her from the massacre out of some sort of caring that took place in is purple thicc boi heart. Also to lend credence to the sacrifice scene making sure that us as an audience aren't totally taken by surprise that he loves her and also showing that Thanos truly believes what he is doing to be right, though I'm sure Hitler thought he was right as well so... eh. 
One more point. Toward the end of your video, you pointed out that marvel had a chance to make a dramatic moment killing off half of the cast but it was ultimately spoiled by the fact that general audiences already know about newer movies coming down the pipeline. I didn't mind too much. Too meek that creates this weird form of meta dramatic irony. Having the audience know that, at least for a few selected characters, everything turns out ok, flips the tension onto those that are still alive, worrying how they're going to react, and what sacrifices have to be made in order to get the point where spiderman 2, Gaurdians 3, and I'm sure black panther 2 can get released. 
Just some thoughts, I still liked the video!",0,0,2018-05-27T21:37:11.000Z,IAmXray0010,UC0jrL3qVDan56-mZ_7_kMeQ,kGBXTfiJLYU,True,UgwguqNs6zwRYTgHLSV4AaABAg

The way I saw him and Gamora (and keep in mind I hate that scene) is that Thanos thinks he loves her if that makes any sense.  I see the movie as Thanos giving us his twisted reasoning for doing what he wants.  Like he has convinced himself that this is a good idea and the scene with Gamora is him now taking his bad logic a step forward.  He thinks he's the good guy and he thinks what he did for Gamora was out of love.  But yeah it still super sucks that they killed off one of the coolest female characters in the series.  I mean she is the Most Dangerous Woman in the Universe and this is how they treat her.

"The thing I didn't like about the film was how Spider-Man went backwards in character development. At the end of Homecoming, Spider-Man becomes his own hero and realizes that he doesn't need to give up on being Peter Parker. He doesn't to be an Avenger, he just needs to embrace what he's best at. He realizes that ditching his school and social life is the wrong thing, and decides to find a way to balance both and stop being a Stark fanboy.

This movie pretends Homecoming never happened, since Spidey acts the same way here as he did in Civil War. In this movie, Tony gives Spider-Man the Iron Spider armor right out of the gate. Yeah, that armor that Spider-Man walked away at the very end of Homecoming, the armor Spider-Man realized he didn't need, the armor that was treated as a joke in Homecoming is just tossed onto Peter and he wears it throughout the rest of the film.

Not only that, but Peter goes back to being a Tony Star fanboy. There is a scene where Tony Stark makes Spider-Man a temporary Avenger, even though he ALREADY turned down the offer at the end of Homecoming. On top of this, Spider-Man jaunts into space with Iron Man and Doctor Strange just cuz. You'd think he would want to go home, as he has a duty to defend his city from villains, or protect his loved ones should Thanos' forces attack. Instead, Spider-Man has to go into space, primarily because the writers ignored his development in the last film.",13,3,2018-05-27T21:04:48.000Z,Monkey Scientist,UCCuW3KIGv69okSNsQWDOKQA,kGBXTfiJLYU,True,UgyojloE2rXOtM5ER8Z4AaABAg

"Thank you! 
The solution-before-the-problem blanket was exactly what threw me out of it.
I gotta say I take a step back in any story where you have Items of Impossible Power, because no events have the same significance anymore; but here it's like it's engineered not to.
The Time Stone! But... it has some sort of limitations, right? 
Too bad there isn't something that can provide more Power (Stone) to it, or change the local rules of Reality (Stone) to overcome that...? 
I will say for me there is still some room for drama in that kind of story; the question becomes *how* will this be fixed, and at what more sustainable cost?
But something about the almost winking reminder of the Time Stone made me sort of internally shrug; it'll work out, I remember feeling as it was going down! I usually can get into the moment better, and I was wondering why this threw me out so hard.
I didn't get half the drama I know others were getting. For me it's 'who's left to solve the problem', and somehow, that didn't even matter as much.

I will say I read Thanos as being a Driven Visionary; he was that econ prof also mixed with Elon Musk but (more?) evil. With that in mind, he was an Executive; the throne scanned as a 'power suit', not like Iron Man, like the people who have the kind of money to make Iron Man (the movie... for now).
Just my reaction, so the retirement at the end felt like golfing, basically, which made it hilarious.

Anyway gosh I love your take on narrative geeking. Thanks as always for the awesome work.

"In the end, the greatest failure of Infinity War was caused by the fans who started pissing and moaning about world building in the individual movies.  A story like what was told in Infinity War hinged on being built before we got to it for it to be fully realized and fleshed out. Since Disney caved to fans after Age of Ultron and started making all the films more ""stand alone"" the world building was gutted. The over-arching stories were left floundering From GotG 2 on, let's just be honest,  they were basically left to die. And in the last half of the build they did die and Infinity War had to scramble to try to A: Revive those, and B: tell the story of Thanos and it should NEVER have had to do A. The fact that Black Panter, Thor Ragnarok, and Gotg 2 did NOTHING to build for Infinity War was a critical failure on Disney's part and the fans who pushed for it. Disney even could have done FAR better with the post credit scenes to stem the hemorrhaging of the world building but they even failed at that when you really, objectively look at it from about the end of the second phase up to Black Panther.

"Take this with a grain of salt but my reading of it was that the Thanos of the movies is kind of a deluded ideologue. What happened to him on Titan was obviously a traumatizing event. He was convinced that the only way to prevent it was to kill half of the population. He was stopped from doing so, and his planet died. 

I think looking at him not in the frame that he's power hungry or a sociopath is the only real way of seeing him in the movies. His solution to the 'problem' is a flawed one. But he is so dedicated to the idea, so consumed by it that he will literally stop at nothing to achieve it. He was stopped in the past and it doomed his planet. He is wrong, we know he is wrong, and we can easily see better uses for the gauntlet but that's why he is a bad guy. He is so consumed by this idea that he literally doesn't see the other alternatives. 

Ultimately all he wants is peace, all he wants is for the universe to be perfect and he thinks killing half the people does that. He even states that when Gomorrah questions him about it, claiming that the planet he took her from is now a paradise after he had finished with it. Whether that is true or not doesn't matter, he feels that is true.

He feels like he has this duty to uphold something that only he wants to attain. Only he has the power to do it, so he has too. He can't let the universe stagnate and kill itself. You notice that his thrown is not opulent. It's hard, isolated and dark. To me that's how he views his own power. It's not something he really wants or needs, his true wants are for universal peace. He only covets and uses power to attain that. The ending on the farm is just an expression of his actual goals. His duties done, he has achieved what he set out to do and there is nothing left for him to achieve. To him it's like a retirement.

And that is, to me, the biggest proof of how deluded he is. He literally thinks killing half the universe is all that is needed to be done. He literally thinks that once that's done, everything will be great for everybody forever. So when he does that, there is nothing left for him to do. He has achieved his goals of universal peace and feels no urge to do anything more. 

The other comments about the deaths and the corny manipulative things I agree with wholeheartedly. I think it's cheesy and I'm 100% they will reverse it all. Notice how they kept all the 'original' avengers still alive?

"Infinity War is Thanos' story, he is the protagonist, his ""victory"" is the story. Maybe if it was named Thanos: Infinity War people would be ok with the ending.

Red Skull was there cause of the tesseract/space stone.

He feels like he should do it cause hes the last titan, and hes also ""mad."" He ""failed"" Titan, but he won't fail the universe.

Favorite daughter cause she's never lost in combat. She's survived all his trials, and he raised her.

Abdicates his throne, because his mission is over, doesn't need his power. He is also, ""mad."" You're not stupid!

There will be permanent changes to the MCU, everyone who didn't die, probably will die or go away in the next one. If you check the synopsis for the next one, it kinda explains. Time stone solution won't be used otherwise strange would've done it on titan.

Sorry, Infinity war story line is their biggest, it was always gonna be 2 movies.

Sorry, didn't see Ragnarok.

Goes to the farm cause his job is done. No one left to genocide. Time to rest. Also, he told Strange exactly what he was gonna do after he was done.

I love you and your analysis! I hope you don't mind the rebuttals! I don't think the movie is perfect, i just think there's things people aren't considering.",3,2,2018-05-27T18:32:47.000Z,SeiShinjitsuShi,UCLKdpBBiYoyhwJmenF1YQNw,kGBXTfiJLYU,True,UgxV4Sj8XByN809mAbh4AaABAg

When loads of actors that practically print money for marvel are dusted, you know at least most of them are coming back.

"My biggest problem with the film, and the Thanos/Gamora relationship, was that they abandoned the double-ended dagger that Thanos gave Gamora as a symbolic motif at some point in the movie for nO REASON. It was used so heavily in the first two acts as a symbol for their relationship, Thanos' view of ""balance"" in relation to the universe, and Gamora's relationship to and place in that, and it kept popping up, the camera kept lingering on it, and then they just sTOPPED using it. There was no tie-in with it to explain that Thanos had fulfilled his goal of ""balance,"" and it felt so careless. Without that tie-in, all of the problems you mentioned about the characters' motivations based around their relationship just hang in the air after the credits roll.

Zak Baggins was brilliant in the action of destroying the house. In cases such as Amityville and the like there is always the house left standing. However in this case such grandiose claims were made had this place been left standing and hundreds of people have flocked on Mass to the's house and nothing happened it would have made him look even more ridiculous than he already does.

"I really hope that Nyx sees this, simply because this is a kinda funny story, and TCM4 was the first horror movie that I saw as a child. I was maybe eight or nine, and it was pretty late. My brother and I were flipping through all the tv channels to find something to watch. When we came across something listed as ""Texas chainsaw massacre."" It cut off the last half of the films title. We were astounded, we were both familiar with the films infamous nature, and the date said it was from the nineties. We thought, this has to be the original because it was old. So we watched it, and we didn't really get what we were hoping for. Now that I've since re-watched it, I can honestly say that it's still just as crazy as it was when I first say it.

"So you mention video games in one of your other videos (I think one of your newer one), and what a lot of people don't realize that film and video gaming are very similar media. The only difference is that video games have to rely more on immersing it's audience than film. They serve two similar purposes; film opens the possibility of dialogue for viewers while video games force the people who play the game to question some pretty hefty things when done properly. These can range from what it means to be human, existence, the ramifications of their actions, regardless of them thinking they made a ""good"" or ""bad"" decision. For me video games helped (and still sort of do) me get through some of the darkest points of my life, and once I found I could question the meanings to the situations gaming presents my view of the medium as art really started. Yeah gaming isn't as old as film, but when you start questioning them like film it really isn't hard to see just how similar to the two mediums are",0,0,2018-04-10T16:45:32.000Z,RawrGamer,UC5cyvzGtdWPCTfsDlOHHC1w,T5JB8rs-O-U,True,UgxS5V0ghEu6BKxgxtJ4AaABAg

"I was personally disappointed with two things, one I am not sure of, in the scene where the dad and his walk back home from the waterfall and just before the run into the old man; they pass a house which the kid looks at for a bit and we know it says ""Keep Out"" but the house was never shown again after that. What was the point of that house? Was it suggesting that it was the home of the old man? Did that House appear before that scene?¬†
Two: The daughter blames herself for what happened in the cold open and she actually is indirectly responsible for a similar moment in the third act because she turns off her aid without realizing what it does when it's on. This means that her personal struggle where she blames herself, is left unresolved because she learns in the final stand off what the hearing aid does but the movie did not show her realize she could have utilized this a lot sooner. Which is something I think her character would do and that's what I was disappointed with.",0,0,2018-04-08T17:06:38.000Z,Angelo Busato,UC6zzUntC_-_C2fg4FM2sHww,XlaZJDhb1es,True,Ugw1Rg1UKMxWMnLoiyV4AaABAg

"As someone who simultaneously needs captions because of audio processing disorder, and has acute enough hearing to be kept awake by the sound of my blood travelling around my body, i really appreciate what this film is trying to do in making people aware of their own sounds.

"I'd just like to say that as a fully deaf and vision impaired person, I love the lighting of this video. Normally, I find it difficult to read your lips due to the shadows and just the way your mouth moves. The normal low light also makes you blend in with the background, creating a very ""trippy?"" setting.
The lighting here perfectly illuminates your face, while keeping the background dark, which really helps create a divide between you and your surroundings. It also gives quite a nice setting for lip reading, and it gives your eyes this strange glow to them, which really adds to the ""ghost"" look you mentioned on your Twitter. üíï

I'm just generally a huge fan of this new set up, and the video in general. I agree with a lot of your points of the silence of the film having an impact on the audience as well. I sat with my girlfriend and several people on the row beside me, and I noticed that none of them were moving much, and whenever I moved they'd be noticeably uncomfortable. At the time I wrote it off as my imagination, but looking back it was probably the sheer disruption of the silence. This entire video had several interesting points that I wouldn't have thought of if I didn't have a hearing person point them out. 
I'm incredibly sorry for the incredibly long comment.",53,0,2018-04-08T03:59:21.000Z,Derris Indica,UCAXKwXPvbmjNIbtWH8KocWA,XlaZJDhb1es,True,UgweauEtwKd_f8tJvCl4AaABAg

"I - a hard of hearing, hearing aid wearer (is that a word?) who is also working on a Bachelor's Degree (in Web Development) - saw this movie last night with my wife and our son. We saw it at a Regal Cinemas theater because they provide Closed Captioning GLASSES, which are BY FAR the best method of providing Closed Captioning to moviegoers I've found. (Harkins Theaters - a big chain here in Arizona - only provides these weird, awkward devices that (try to) fit in the cup holders built into the arm rests in their seats. They end up slipping out of the cup holders repeatedly. And, they have this huge LED display sitting on top of a flexible arm which holds the display out and up in front of you while you try to watch the movie. They were the first to offer any sort of Closed Captioning technology, but it's a poor design, especially compared to Regal's glasses.)

That said, you're right - the movie is pretty nearly soundless. Fortunately, though, my hearing aids allowed me to hear the score that does pop in during the ""running"" scenes. That intense staccato score when the characters are running was amazing.

And, I love that they cast a hard of hearing actor for the hard of hearing character role!

"I've seen it when it came out, so my memory of it isn't that great, but I remember I liked some stuff about it and some that I didn't.
As far as remakes go, I think it was done well in a sense that it stays true to original (plot) but it also adds it's unique scenes so it doesn't feel like DejaVu. 

Also, I remember that I like the ending where they play with trope that you should never turn around when faced with evil because that way you acknowledge evil is next to you. They play with this trope literally here. The only other movie that does this that I currently remember is The Eye, that scene when lead girl is in the elevator and ghost of an old man shows up behind her and she's shivering in fear because she knows he's behind her and if she turns around she'll interact with him and he'll probably attack her. I think both of these movies did those scenes well.",0,0,2018-04-07T02:08:00.000Z,njmfff,UC4eKClrLRGhNlxK94aiKh-g,PFPtHaNL7B8,True,Ugx2NFJ1WchmwIX6sj14AaABAg

"I didn't like it, at all. It had some good moments, but overall it was quite weak for me and many scenes felt forced, narrative was quite bad and editing was horrible, it was all over the place. Jump scares didn't help either, they became annoying after a while. However, I really liked the casting of kids, I thought they were all pretty good actors and suit the rolls. You know that lot of ""kids in horror"" suffer from terrible child actors or just badly written kid characters.

There were many problems with plot and narrative, for example, bully is complete psychopath that wants to murder kids, his buddy gets killed by Pennywise and he never once questions his disappearance. In fact, script entirely forgets about that guy because no one ever mentions him again. At least in 90s version, bully went on to avenge his buddy, even tho he was also cartoonish in that version too.",0,0,2018-04-07T00:46:49.000Z,njmfff,UC4eKClrLRGhNlxK94aiKh-g,RqVd8vNadEU,True,UgwPHKLmsuNIoysIXBd4AaABAg

"Your interpretation of the ending totally crystallized the movie for me.  I knew what the hipster monologue was saying wasn't the point and I had a sense of what it was saying, but that makes it makes sense.  The monologue was all about the fear of our existential predicament and that nothing truly ""matters"", but that's wrong.  Life isn't about a lasting legacy, it's about the people we affect in the here and now.  We may have these aspirations of immortality, but that's not what makes up our lives in the moment.  The moments of life are made up by our affect on the few individuals we know closely whether they be lovers, friends, or family.  Beethoven may have been writing for God, but what was real was his life in the moment of his existence.

"What spooks me the most is how Dale Cooper's drive to save Laura Palmer wasn't completely driven by wanting to do good, but also by a desire to prove to himself that he is a good person.

When pursuing a hobby you enjoy, it's easy to define yourself by that hobby. Then the things you like about the hobby get diminished or removed, and you find you don't like it anymore. But you think you should. And the pursuit becomes hollow.

I will now use myself as an example of what David Lynch means by ""fix your heart or die.""

I like writing. I don't do it as much as I should, but I enjoy it anyway. I've been pursuing stand-up comedy as a hobby because it gives me an excuse to write. Then I can get on stage, and show my writing to an audience.

In this lies a problem with myself. I don't enjoy the performance part of stand-up very much, even though that's like 2/3 of why a joke works.

So, why not just write a book, or some short stories? Well, instant gratification is one reason. I like knowing that my ideas resonate with people. And I can find that out instantly by telling the joke on stage. I need to prove to myself that my ideas are worthy by checking with an audience, a jury of my peers.

A jury of my peers. Because I always feel like I'm on trial. And now I'm starting to see some darker feelings in myself. The fear of persecution that makes me lay my thoughts bare before someone can hurt me.

My heart feels two different ways about being persecuted. The first way I feel is that I enjoy being alone. I can hide in my room, and enjoy privacy because then no one can persecute me. Write my jokes alone until my thoughts are ready to share.

But I also know I can't hide from society. There are basic functions I need to perform if I want to get a job and shop for groceries. I have to talk to people. And because I'm afraid of persecution, if I do need to talk to people, I'll constantly check in. I'll go from being anti-social, to completely over-social. Because I need to know that I'm not hated or persecuted. *These two opposite actions are driven by the same fear. Holy shit!*

And it affects what kind of stuff I write, and how I choose to express myself. Maybe I need a healthy mix of things. I need to do simple writing with an audience because it keeps me grounded to other people. But I also need to do more serious, in-depth, complicated writing that doesn't lend itself to instant gratification, but lets me explore myself more. I have been denying myself of the latter, and will be fixing this soon.

It's funny. The heart is allowed to want two completely different things, that have nothing to do with each other. But our actions only let us pick one of those things. Reality itself prevents us from being who we truly are.

God damn, it took several paragraphs of personal experiences to describe what David Lynch can do in like 4 minutes of on-screen goodness with fictional characters.

I've always had a hard time watching Twin Peaks. I really enjoyed Eraserhead, but Twin Peaks was always way too slow for me, and I'd give up after the first few episodes. But it seems like if I put in more patience, I'll be rewarded with some more cerebral stuff.

"I thought it was most likely heavily exaggerated after i finished watching & _at-least_ some of it was complete bull-shit, but the crazy thing about the film is you can verify pretty much every claim that they've made through research & freedom of information - the 911 calls, hospital records, & all the horrible shit that happened to almost everyone involved in the production were all legit. I mean, that Dr _really_ almost died, & Zach _really_ almost lost his vision, both a result of their time in that house... That's not even including the EVPs & video evidence, which, I dunno what you watched (referring to when you stated the evidence they gathered was a bit lackluster), but that fucking *_growl_* & the shadow figure at the end were fucking *terrifying.* After verifying all of the health & psychological issues w/pretty much everyone involved, I *100%* believe it's _all real._ There's just too much verifiable evidence corresponding w/their time in the house itself for it to be coincidence.

Also. i feel like you misinterpreted the purpose of Zach stating _""This film is cursed.""_ a little bit... I took it more as, everything that happened; all the health issues, the lawsuit against him, the loss of crew members & potential witnesses backing out, along w/all the delays of the film's release - it was cursed because it was a nightmare to make, & its production cost a _lot_ of people some pretty serious repercussions just by being involved w/it. I don't think he ever implied, nor did i ever get the impression he meant _cursed_ as in it will physically hurt or kill you if you watch it... I could be wrong but as goofy as Zach is at times, that's a little corny, & too preposterous for even him to claim. That's some facebook _""like this meme in 20 seconds or die in a fire tonight.""_ level fuckery & i son't think he'd sink that low.

I enjoyed your critique as i enjoy every video you release, & sometimes even only watch things you review so that i can watch your video on it w/out being spoiled, but i interpreted the film a little differently than you on this 1, & felt like you _kinda_ belittled it a little, & made it seem like it was a bad thing that Zach took it _deadly_ seriously, which i don't really understand where you're coming from there.

"I've watched every season of Ghost Adventures as my not-so-guilty pleasure, so I was excited as hell for this. I enjoyed it for the much of the same reasons why I still watch the show. I have a sceptical interest in the paranormal and I enjoy the gory history of the locations, the over the top drama and the personalities of the investigators. Zac is certainly a real interesting character, from all the accounts I've read, he is as weirdly intense as he comes across in the movie. I felt very uncomfortable that he included the deaths of Debby Constantino and her roommate as proof of the strength of the demons, when it was a double murder/suicide committed by her husband (who had also been on GA). I think it's suspect that he had the house torn down too, I know what he claims the reasoning behind it is, but they hardly showed any of their investigations (compared to what they show on the show even when nothing has happened or they've debunked things). It just seems like he's done it so no other investigators can go in to debunk his evidence.

"This is one of my least favorite teen fiction books (as a bookstore employee that specializes in recommending teen and horror/thriller books, I try to stay up to date on popular books). It's obvious the movie isn't any better. The book has the same issues with consent that you mentioned the movie having. Wouldn't recommend unless people like reading about toxic relationships and creepy consent issues. And to answer the open ended question, seeing Woman in Black wasn't great. People were talking throughout, giggling at the suspenseful parts, and someone a couple seats down threw up all over the floor and seats halfway through the movie (I'm incredibly emetophobic, so that launched me into a panic attack, and then when the little girl gets sick later in the movie it just retriggered my panic attack and I actually had to get up and go to the bathroom). Thank goodness for a blend of Gin-Gins to settle my stomach and a few breathing exercises my mom has taught me (she's a school counselor).

"I don't mind Alien 3 because of its strange depressing tone. I like to think of it more as a fan film more than an actual installment in the series (Same as Resurrection). But it does not feel like an Alien movie at all. It does fit the flow of the movies though, by having Alien be about birth, Aliens is motherhood, and Alien 3 is death. But the writing in this movie is terrible and this is not an underrated movie. The production of this movie was a nightmare going through many, many script changes that would have been far better in comparison to the finished product. Killing off three of the main characters at the beginning of the film is the worst way to start a sequel and comes off extremely underwhelming. It painfully shows how lazy the writing was. Even the people who worked on this movie hate it. This movie works if I'm watching it as a standalone movie or like I was saying, as a fan film. The character are boring and stiff, the tone of the movie is all wrong and is just meh.

"They should re do this movie, but with a twist. Cathy, finds a doll, and does not act weird at all maybe super sweet and all that, and stuff starts to happen, people die or get really badly hurt. Her mother of course blames Cathy and tries to harm her daughter thinking she is either a demon in her daughter or her daughter doing this some how against her. 
When Cathy does teleport, it is cause she was placed in a situation where if she didn't teleport Cathy's mom would have harmed or killed her.
Getting the idea? Cathy is not possessed but has powers, powers she got from her mother who is abusive. The mother never NEW she had powers for the entire movie, and blames all the wrong doings and strange things on Cathy.
Cathy of course knows she can and knows how to use her powers to protect herself in some way. Granted her powers are short ranged teleportation doing high stress moments, like when her bring is producing a certain chemical, and a degree of seeing into the future by a few moments, saving herself from poison her mom tried to sneak into her food.
The mother's powers are fueled from emotions, mainly her negative ones, causing things from people feeling pushed to being influenced to do terrible things to themselves or others. One such person tries to attack Cathy, a priest, saying Cathy is the devil, something her mother keeps saying. 
When the mother goes to the mental hospital for some time, her friend takes care of Cathy while the mother is away, and while the mother is in the area the friend is very scared and suspicious of Cathy, but the moment the mother is far enough away, the friend just acts nice and normal. Thus in an odd since every thing the mother has said her daughter does, never happens and people think the mother is just needing some time to de stress.

Now when it comes to the powers, the only reason its kicked on is cause both powers are near each other. Think of it like two queens, and one is trying to take out the other to establish her rule. While the mother does not know she has this power, her power is actually stronger then Cathy's, and cause she does not know about her power, well people get hurt or killed. And the reason these powers come into play is cause Cathy awakens to hers on a more obvious scale for Cathy. So cause of Cathy's powers, her mother's powers also kicks on in a more manipulative way, leading to an indirect unknowing fight for control.",3,1,2018-03-11T14:42:10.000Z,Hastur King,UCnENIvwfu4byp6nPzfO0HXQ,6DEDGl7LOWU,True,UgyLfOkYZsciKYgM_OV4AaABAg

"Ironically, I had my best and worst theater experience the same night. My best friend had come back to town for the weekend after two years and we wanted to got to the drive in for the night. We seen Guardians of the Galaxy and Purge Anarchy. People reacted to so positively to Guardians of the Galaxy, I've never seen something like it before or after. People audibly laughed, cried, and cheered when it was over. There was a giant group formed outside of the concessions and bathrooms not getting food or anything but just talking about the movie. I should have known from the get go that seeing a purge movie (or really any horror movie) at the drive in would be a bad idea because it's really super dark and you really couldn't see what was going on because of that. At about an hour in people got bored and just started talking and walking around. I remember very clearly that there were two teenagers just throwing a glow stick necklace back and forth like a Frisbee and I honestly found that more entertaining than the movie. Some people straight up left in the middle of it, starting up their cars and distracting me even more. After the movie had ended there was no fan fair or anything, people just got in their cars and left. When we got home my friend and I were talking about the movies agreeing that we liked Guardians pretty well. She asked if I knew what happened in Purge Anarchy and I couldn't tell her. We did not remember anything that happened at all.

"I've had 2 at least somewhat bad theater experiences. The first was when I had gone with a group of friends to see Captain America: Civil War, and the power went out in the entire mall about 15 minutes in. Power was out for probably a good 15-20 minutes, and during that time, there was a father loudly yelling how this was a waste of his time and that if he'd known this was going to happen, he ""wouldn't have taken the day off to see this dumb fucking movie with his freaking kids"". Power came back on, theater manager gave everyone a free movie voucher (we ended up using ours to see Warcraft), movie was restarted.
Second was when I went with my now ex to see Captain Underpants. Early in the day, opening week. The theater was full of moms and kids under the age of 10. Not only did we get looks for being the only childless adults in the theater, but 5 groups of a mom accompanying about 3-5 children tried to kick us out of our seats. I ended up yelling at a woman at the end, because she -demanded- we leave our seats, because she needed them for her and her 4 kids. Had to explain to this COMPLETE stranger that my ex is mostly deaf, and we had chosen these seats so that he could hear.

"I have my own problem with AMC. They came to my town last year and bought out all the major theaters. First, I have to tell you that my parents have a long history of assisting one of the formerly Carmike-owned theaters in town with movie promotions. They would decorate the lobby with props, many of which were recycled from my dad's elaborate outdoor Halloween displays. For example, he used all manner of skeletons dressed up as pirates and props like a raft with a ship's wheel, for Pirates of the Caribbean 3. They also dressed up as characters from the movie and sometimes did little skits for the audience before the show, along with other community members the theater manager enlisted. For the premiere of The Dark Knight, I was part of a whole crew of clown-masked Joker goons patrolling the lobby. It was a blast! It really made big movie premieres special...

"Part of the hopeful message as well, imo, is that the protagonist's self awareness, despite being a burden put upon her by the system, can also empower her actions. The antagonist, on the other hand, is deeply uncomfortable with self awareness and introspection, and this is his downfall. He should have known she could and would kill him rather than go back, but his own possible failure was an impossible concept to consider. For the oppressed, our failure and subsequent disposal by society is something we constantly face. It's extremely harmful, psychically, but it's also something that we can harness to move mountains if we act collectively, a possibility enabled by our consideration of ourselves and how we impact others.",6,0,2018-02-26T05:23:53.000Z,Jetsetlemming,UC__rxaB2fGiBlyQ51QO2K0Q,OTtTaQfB99U,True,UgyQCLrFcekDfrXig5d4AaABAg

"So, the other force acting on the same level as the woman in the radiator (death) -  it must be the man in the planet, right? He seems to be both fate and birth, since he pulls the levers after the abstract sex scene that sets things in motions, and then brings it to a halt when Henry embraces death (or after he kills the child, if you wanna look at it that way.) It kinda makes sense that he would be the embodiment of both of these concepts, since one's birth is merely fate. I.E no one chooses to come here, to be born.

Henry brings the child into a world of suffering by a blunder. It seems that this will inevitably lead to ruin for both of them. The child has no hope in this crazy world, especially with it's condition; Henry is fated to sacrifice his own life to vainly protect it anyways. Staring down a life of horrors, he chooses death - for both of them.

I used to like this movie simply because of how strange it was. Now it reads more like a devastatingly honest take on this process that we all take for granted, and it's implications. (birth, suffering, and death)

"Nyx Fears, not a dis just observation, w/out the hair, and glasses I guess, you have a resemblance of Wyatt Russell, ""Ezra"" in Ingrid Goes West. Just kinda interesting I just watched it now, was trying to look up how the ASSHOLE character Nicki caught on to Ingrid so fast (really, he hated her 1st thing; why and how did he know? Just, saw through her? Yeah I'd buy that, but not THAT quickly) and your the 1st review I've watched, and you look like the dude Ezra. This is, obviously not important in hind sight just...lol nevermind and btw good review bro! Really, you dissected some very real issues, damn good man. 

Let me say more on that cause I opened w/""you look like Ezra"", yeah I know who the fuck cares. Social media can be, damn dangerous. But I love how you nailed this...why? Just cause it's ""social media""? Course not, no, hell these days it can be a bad thing of sorts not to have ANY account, as many employers may be on the look out for, say, what you portray of sorts, what your messages are, etc. to get an understanding of potential interviews. But keeping up w/everyone, being so ""politically correct"" and wanting any viewers/subscribers/followers to really ""like"" you. When maybe we should have the mentality of ""who the fuck cares."" But that in itself is a tricky slope. The dangers of putting your whole time into this? Cyber bullying and not being able to fight that back. Too many damn people wanting your time. You losing time on REAL relationships of any sort because you're constantly updating your page. Caring to a fault where self esteem can be manipulated...by people we don't even FUCKIN know. Strangers knowing too much. Obviously, disillusioned people that end up, hurting themselves, threats to do it, threats to hurt others, hurting others...and suicide/homicide.

"Mentioning hyperreality brought back Pretty Little Liars Flashbacks, which is probably the only other show I've seen take its intended audience and transform it into the surreal ever so slowly in the way of Twin Peaks. Also has a split finale, except it being a network TV show, the final episode is the happy one, whereas the existential episode is 7x19.

"This film was a bolt of something down my spine when I watched it. Part of me was watching from a once removed spot of being amazed that the film existed, it seemed so much like a dream I would have of a movie like this. It's like what Zardoz did in my young mind when it wasn't cracking me up (and sometimes when it was). Only more so.
Then there was a part of me just... totally in it. It just did whatever the hell it was doing so perfectly, I was kind of chanting 'yes!' in the back of my head.
It was so engaging and difficult at the same time, it was like I couldn't just be an audience member, and couldn't stop.
And the reflected/doubled imagery of the film was not lost on me, in that.
Thank you for digging into what it was doing and how it worked. 
I think I'm better armed to try to share this film with some friends now; a little prep, a little warning, and maybe they can actually see this movie for what it is... which was freaking amazing, and yeah for me, actually important.

He is a transcendental meditator trying to open up your mind to free thinking and transcendence but done with massive tongue in cheek, a big heart and strong quality filmmaking. Im not criticism you as I love your channel.

"I am... super late commenting on this. It's actually one of my favourite videos of yours, and I rewatch it quite a lot. I've always thought this though: with these types of surreal artstyles, and in the context of a story that the reader will end up putting themselves into, the reader is required to shift their mental image of themselves. So, a kid reading these stories will automatically place themselves into the story - this is what makes these taboo subjects so upsetting - but with the provided images, they can't imagine their normal selves. It's nearly impossible to imagine these uncanny, horrifying things in the real world, and so in placing yourself within their universe, you yourself are morphed into a surreal and uncanny version of yourself. Does this make sense?

"( There are examples for really effective ""ghost guy in the hall"" situations out of nowhere.
Remember the party ghost guy with the head wound in the Hall in ""Shining""  or the kneeing man with the dog mask. Well, yes,  if I watch this review, I don't think, "" Winchester"" is this category of movie.

The most impressive horror movie scene in this sense is in the original ""The eye"", where a blind woman gets an eye implantation and first enjoys being able to see until she always sees ghosts mixing in her everything day life. Mostly in broad day light.
I guess, a lot of the shown phantoms are based on asian urban ghost legends, that's why they aren't explained much. 

The scariest scene to me was when she's alone in a lift at night and suddenly an old man spawns behind her hanging in the air. His head is hanging as if he's sleeping or ..well..dead. But then he starts to move around her until she gets conscious of him and screams.

"Awesome analysis. Aside from the theme of collective dreams, The Return is also a direct comment on nostalgia revivals - you can never go home, lightening will never strike twice in the same place. It deliberately sets out to frustrate the audience by denying them Cooper and the other original characters, who, when they return, are caricatures trapped in behavioural loops. They are trapped in nostalgia as the real world passes them by - eg the talk in the Road House of other characters we never get to meet. And at the end, when they return to the Palmer house, the door is answered by the person who actually owns the house in real life - this is the real world and they can never fully return to the cosy nostalgia of the fictional Twin Peaks.

"Absolutely worth the wait, masterful interpretation of a equally masterful series. I agree exactly that the love of Twin Peaks is in chasing the questions rather then the answers we find. Personally I saw the ending as a sad admittance of the tragic nature of the impact of Trauma itself, Dale/Richard suffered in a dream for three lifetimes to 'fix his heart' but even with the town itself purging away all it's evil and retconning Laura's tragedy itself, Laura/Carrie's pain can't be washed away no matter what and all that's left is the reminder of her last agonizing moments. For all the truly good outcomes that sympathy and reflection can achieve as Lynch shows, that final 'lights out' seems like a bitter sigh that past wounds can only be worked through then ever defeated 'like in the movies'.",0,0,2018-02-15T05:29:35.000Z,EvolutionCOV,UCf7oH-H_FmKHwoH0TXaxwPw,cprCVU5UYIk,True,UgzTX8dMZ-F_jfztfN54AaABAg

"I‚Äôm going to have to save this one to watch later, since I haven‚Äôt watched the new series yet. And may not. I watched Twin Peaks in its original network run, and it was a great cultural moment, with a big impact on me. I waited until the new series wrapped, and then finally put the whole thing on my iPad for two separate 11 hour flights I was scheduled to take in one week. Uninterrupted, close-up watch time! And I didn‚Äôt even make it through the first episode. The sophomores doing their first high school play style of direction was SO painfully distracting, I couldn‚Äôt watch it. I preferred watching the screen showing an animation of the plane‚Äôs current location. Now, it certainly isn‚Äôt unusual for a ‚Äúnew‚Äù show to take a few hours to warmup, and maybe if I watch our dear Nyx talk about a few episodes it will make me more interested in trying again, but for now I just remain disappointed and uninterested. :(",0,0,2018-02-15T01:37:44.000Z,D C,UCehdwa6sc6TSyKjZgxSuXFQ,cprCVU5UYIk,True,UgxmPevJYUJZrSKVShR4AaABAg

"As someone just learning Jung this was pretty cool. I actually felt kind of smart for once.
So the ""collective dream"" is the gestalt of the collective evolutionary subconscious drives and ""sub systems""/partial identities which exist within everyone, and since almost everyone has these same sub systems holding up, and maybe even creating, our consciousness/ego, we're all effected in generally the same way by the same things, at least the larger historical events.

I wouldn't say that the event which let evil in to the world was the creation of nuclear bombs. There were massacres and atrocities before America used their nukes. Maybe Lynch is trying to say something about the psychological impact living under the threat of nuclear annihilation has on people and that lets evil seep its way into our hearts, but even before people lived with the threat of constant annihilation, at least of themselves and their families and their communities from invading armies or even tyrants. What is the qualitative difference between having everything and everyone you love and care about wiped out and having the entire world destroyed to an individual? It seems to be all the same to me.

To me Nuclear weapons aren't an evil. They were spawned in an act of desperation. America wasn't some supervillian creating things because they hated the world. I'm always drawn to the vision of Carrie from the Stephen King book in the gymnasium, she's been soaked with blood, she unleashes her power as a response to the pain she feels, and everyone gets slaughtered. Japan was not innocent, dropping the nukes was a measure to save the lives of thousands of American soldiers.

Also, I saw the Doctor as more of an Alex Jones type; always talking about how everything sucks and how virtuous he is and how other people are all the problem, but of course it's not him. I don't even know if he believed anything he was saying or if it was all a show to manipulate vulnerable people to give him money for shovels spray painted gold.

One thing I'm interested in is tracing back the collective unconscious through history and seeing how each event caused the next.

Also, I don't know if we're tied to a chair, maybe if we can predict the outcomes we can put a boulder in the river bed and dig an alternate path for the water to flow to redirect the currents of history.",6,1,2018-02-15T01:06:55.000Z,Plasma Bat,UCihOicDn6GV3pbunbJxP4Xg,cprCVU5UYIk,True,UgxFhYdVsONMycV84dt4AaABAg

"Funny thing is that I watched the first two seasons, Fire Walk With Me and The Missing Pieces in the span of a few weeks not too long after receiving the now OOP 10 disc blu-ray box set.

I actually came really late in the game for Twin Peaks and was more accustomed to Lynch's cinematic works, so seeing the first two seasons was...a bit of a shock to the system to me. Yeah it occasionally hinted and even dipped its feet into the harder edged stuff seen in Lynch's feature films, but I was a teensy bit underwhelmed by the original seasons in the sum of its parts (though I love the hell out of it when it gets weird...and yes, I even have a soft spot for the Nadine subplot in S2).

Fire Walk With Me, on the other hand...holy shit. It was like sitting through a middle of the road family visit and being awarded with one on one time with a girl you absolutely love to pieces. FWWM is easily up there with Eraserhead and Blue Velvet as one of the best films in Lynch's filmography. An absolutely brutal and gut wrenching tour de force. Watching The Missing Pieces immediately afterward only enhanced my love of FWWM.

...so yeah, i'm a bit of an outlier in the TP fandom. The Return was an absolute delight, BTW. Dougie 4 Lyfe!",5,0,2018-02-14T22:11:45.000Z,GasmaskAvenger,UCrEHggstPRPZHid3sOAbThw,cprCVU5UYIk,True,UgwE51gAz1uBAQSUi9F4AaABAg

"Most of the criticism I see of Alien: Covenant tends to fall into either people wanting to see another Alien movie or people wanting to see a better version of Prometheus. 

I fall somewhere in the gray land of not really knowing what to expect when I went in. I like it more than most people do, but I still can't say I think it's a good movie. Its themes are really intriguing, but I just wish the movie was executed better. To me, it feels like it's this back and forth between being an actual direct sequel to Prometheus or just another Alien movie, but it doesn't quite do either that well. Hell, it basically turns into the latter entirely in the last act, easily the worst bit of this push pull relationship. There's also a lot more of the same feeling ""what the hell"" that Prometheus had, except in Prometheus pretty much all of that is regulated to some weird character actions. In Covenant, parts of the film just feel really weird. Part of it feels like shit's just missing from the movie (the relationships between some of characters were either left out - the gay couple that you would barely be able to tell is a couple unless you REALLY paid attention or you knew about some of the deleted scenes, like that entire scene could have been kept in the movie some how and it would have benefited it overall since we would have more reason to care about the characters because general empathy or something - and some characters were just underdeveloped - the 'lead' felt really bland, and it seemed like she was only there for the film's last act - or just developed in ways that doesn't benefit the film - the new captain is a complete asshole for no real discernible reason and it doesn't help the movie at all as it just has me questioning ""why would you do that?"" in a bad way) and some scenes feel like they shouldn't be there at all (the shower scene that's practically only there for trailer footage, and god i wish this movie had a completely different last act, or that it was at least executed better).

I wasn't really disappointed by my expectations going in so much as I was disappointed that the film wasted the potential it had. I really like Prometheus - it gets WAY too much shit - in spite of its flaws. Could have made a great sequel to it, and that seems like that's what they wanted to do, but I don't know if it was studio involvement or whatever. Overall, I don't know. I've only seen it once, maybe my mind will change, but I doubt it. 

Also I called the twist at the end as soon as the robot fight ended.

"It always feels weird when horror movies based on historical stuff comes out.

There are still people around who remember those events and I knew plenty of people who were nearby during the incidents. 
The way how this movie blamed real historical events on ghosts left a similar taste in my mouth. I mean, at least the 1906 earthquake happened well over 100 years ago, but it still doesn't sit right.

"(the frick I'm doing commenting on a old video? idk, it's 3 am) What killed found footage was the overuse of the genre on movies that didn't need it and could be shot in a traditional manner and also the lack of realism and originality. Shaky camera and cheap jumpscares don't cut anymore. The blair which, for instance, was so big because it didn't have cheap jumpscares, but a real slow burn, good story (which a lot of found footage lack of) and realistic set up for the situation the characters are in (ALSO ACTUAL CHARACTERS THAT YOU CAN RELATE AND CARE ABOUT), where you actually don't know what to expect, and also doesn't know if what they are facing is supernatural or man made. When found footage directors realize you don't just shake a camera and put some distortion on the movies to make it spoopy, then found footage will be good again.

"Nice to see another Ridley Scott fan but I must confess that between the two movies he put out last year, All The Money In The World was much better than Alien Covenant. It was tighter and less clunky than Covenant was, with a magnificent performance by Christopher Plummer and probably one of the best scores I heard that year (the other being A Cure For Wellness).

That being said, Covenant DOES give me scenes like the clusterfuck that is the Neomorph birth, that beautiful intro with David & Weyland and the infamous ""Fingering"" bit, so it's definitely worth a watch just to see Scott indulge in space nihilism.",1,0,2018-01-28T14:33:02.000Z,TheDeadFellow,UCHIJZe-40Yutx50sihbsFCw,F_eJr3GpnY4,True,Ugyn3O-MLj6d4KKUnJB4AaABAg

"Because you make some good videos, I feel like responding to most of these movies, based on my own personal tastes. Spoilers are in here, obviously.

Brawl on Cell Block 99 is absolutely a ""Holy Shit"" movie, and is also a freaking masterpiece. This movie has a lot of senseless, bloody violence, but it manages to be incredibly meaningful by doing that. The overall tone, theme, and message of the film would not work at all without it, despite all of the extreme brutality occurring actually late into the movie. Absolutely recommended.

Need to see Shape of Water...

Alien: Covenant was just alright to me. Also still need to not only see the Blade Runner sequel, but the original as well.

Mother! I haven't seen. I was planning to, but a lot of reviews even praising it really made it seem like a not so good movie to see with the types I see movies with... Especially that one scene I heard about oh god what that got into a theater release, HOLY SHIT.

Get Out, another masterpiece in my opinion. I had doubts about its subject matter when I first saw the trailer, but oh man, those doubts were completely wrong. I would talk about the direct, modern day social commentary but I am a simpleton and I would probably get it very wrong and be called a terrible person because of it. I will say that a major strength is how easily you can empathize with the situation of the film (becoming a prisoner in your own mind and body because of a brain transplant), because not only does it work into the commentary aspect, but it's such a universally scary idea. I think that universal aspect helps make the commentary a lot easier to mull over. What I would say ""HOLY SHIT"" about in regards to this movie is that it was nominated for an award as a comedy?????

The Love Witch... this was released in 2017?! Holy Shit! The directors really nailed the look of those late 60's and early 70's films. Maybe 50's? I hope that the ""Witch"" aspect is legit, I'm a sucker for any sort of magic and sorcery.

Finally, some videos I'd like to see: maybe something about animation? Maybe video games? I can understand not wanting to talk the latter, because there's some overlap with cinema, but there's a lot of completely different things to keep in mind altogether. And yes, I would love an analysis of IT. I liked it, but I think there could've been a lot of things shown or not shown to help give off certain vibes. Namely, that a lot of the scares end up being too goofy, and didn't feel much like a horror movie altogether. The scariest it gets is the intro for the film, because holy shit they actually start this movie off with a kid's arm being messily bitten off, aaaaaaa. The scenes like the one with the painting were stellar as well, but those eventually peter out into Pop Goes The Pennywise.",0,0,2018-01-20T00:24:34.000Z,HyperThermal,UCrRSjiUeewACP3r3F2CZUvw,F_eJr3GpnY4,True,UgxYbOCOO5Yf-QZ9gg14AaABAg

"My main issue with Mother was that it felt like Aronofsky was trying to absolve himself of all fault for his divorce while also complaining about people misinterpreting his films. I'm likely just reading it so unsympathetically since I finally watched Perfect Blue (I'd been saving it to watch after Satoshi Kon died) and I realised that Aronofsky is possibly incapable of (or uninterested by) original thought.

But the issue about getting irritated with how people view something you've created is so frustrating for me, because either you've failed to communicate something you intended as explicit, which shows a lack of empathy and understanding of your own audience, or you've left something deliberately vague (or obtuse) in which case speculation and theorising is where all the fun is. I feel like all too often creators approach these situations with antagonism for the average person, as though a layman's experience is wrong, or an insult. Like, no one's forcing you to put your films in theatres worldwide, you could just as easily leave it in MOMA if you don't trust normal humans to appreciate your vastly superior artistic intelligence.

Like, if you don't want people misinterpreting your work then just get fucking better at doing whatever it is you expect other people to see, or learn to appreciate and value the experience of the people who pay your god damn bills.

And then later there is a JOHN WATERS CAMEO? and also the fucking chipmunks get on the NO FLY LIST.

Holy shiy movies from 2017 that I highly recommend are The Killing of A Sacred Deer, which might just be one of my new favourite movies of all time. Go into it completely blind, it's absolutely incredible. A wholly different movie is Call Me by Your Name. What makes this a holy shit movie is just how accurately it is able to portray human sensuality and connect with the audience. It doesn't feel like a film, you feel like you're a part of the characters and like you are living in this film, this is my favourite film of 2017.

"I hope 2018 is better for you.
 2017 seem like it was pretty much hell for everybody.
 I wish I could give you some advice that would help , but with depression it's different for everybody.
 I have post-traumatic stress disorder from being held captive by a murder for 5 weeks in 2009,  and I'm also bipolar schizophrenic.

 sometimes I get into moods where I know I'm crazy but I still can't control it.
sometimes I break down and cry and literally be saying why am I crying.

 it's a struggle that a lot of people deal with.

"(Sorry for the long-winded comment in advance) Hey Nyx, I've been meaning to say this for a number of months now but never ""felt out"" an appropriate time to do it. I happened across Nick Nocturne's first video quite literally when he had only one video out pre-1k subs, and as a burgeoning horror buff I ate his stuff up as it dropped. I learned of your channel through him, and while I had enjoyed your content at the time I didn't feel as compelled to support your content back then, and eventually kind of forgot about your channel for a year or two for the most part.

That changed last year; once again drawn by Night Mind I saw your ""Bye Bye Man"" video of all things, and I was completely floored by how much I felt your acting, your set design, and your production as a whole had improved since I had last seen your content. Seeing this really funny character of you you've created while adding an in-world foil with little mini-stories complete with sets was amazing, and the fact that you've managed to keep up your overall level of quality to these standards despite as I've learned you being hard at work in college has been really inspiring to me. Seriously, you've absolutely blown me away with what you've managed to create here on YouTube and especially with how much you've pushed and improved yourself.

I'm not a rich person, but you're one of the (literal) handful of people I actually feel compelled to support on Patreon. I've given a pittance until now, but after seeing how much you've put in I've decided to up my pledge 5x. As long as you decide to keep making content you've got a supporter in me for life, through whatever ups and downs that brings and whatever hardships life throws at you. Wishing you all the best in 2018 and hoping what little I can give helps keep you going in some small way. <3",75,1,2018-01-16T03:03:48.000Z,Blanchard,UCt7aa9dVU1nYuktbdyEaTRw,F_eJr3GpnY4,True,UgwaLVL6vmX4cDz3Lap4AaABAg

I've been told by family and friends that I would be a great movie critic as a lot of people enjoy my Facebook posts of each movie review, but I have a body for radio and a voice for kiddy porn, so I'll just keep enjoying everyone else's YouTube videos and I'll stick to the written word. :D Thank you for another great video!",0,0,2018-01-06T04:08:09.000Z,Artic Vixen,UCxPavzFcqT-T2geRZFJ9kBg,QS3Z3knRU1k,True,UgxxnEU4EDISiBiDgZx4AaABAg

"There aren't many films that deal with topics on erotophobia (I tried to do some research because of my interest in psychology), and I'd say that Eraserhead does a good job with bringing out this fear in people. Many people praise It Follows for its depictions of sexual guilt, but Eraserhead truly makes the concept disturbing. Instead of adding a slasher sense that It Follows takes from its obvious 1980s influences, Eraserhead uses that disgusting imagery and audiography that makes people want to watch it over again, asking ""What the hell did I just watch?"" Erotophobia is a natural fear that a majority of people are either not aware of or try to deny.

I just think that movie studios/that press machine does a bit of a better job of dehumanizing and idolizing its stars. I don't feel that way about youtube. Maybe instagram and other social media is more like that, I'm not sure. Or maybe it's because I don't watch the most 'glamorous' people.

"Personally, I love the found footage genre. The Blair witch project was amazing, and I'm obsessed with things like Marble Hornets, DarkHarvest00, and TribeTwelve. It's sad that not only are most new found footage movies terrible, but that most shows like the ones I listed are either over or haven't had any updates to the story in a long time (MLAndersen went three years without anything, gave us a three minute video last year, then disappeared again) found footage is fading, which is sad because it has so much potential as a genre. It can genuinely terrify people since its very realistic and makes you feel sympathy for the characters. Going back to Marble Hornets, the characters are very relatable and realistic, allowing the viewer to feel a connection and be affected when something bad happens to them. This is really what makes a found footage film. Being able to connect with the characters.",1,0,2017-12-03T14:42:03.000Z,Jay,UCgpQVu4_OCUWIc7uVoty2Og,RDgzrhFXOSU,True,UgwFcb2cUAubHOlPnU54AaABAg

"It's really just classic narrative dissonance to portray something you want the audience to hate as something awesome.

It's sort of like how a lot of superhero movies portray the heroes as being responsible, dull and miserable, while the villain is out having fun, being charming and chatty, snarky, and just generally having a great time and being the all-powerful person that we all want to be. Who's not going to think Loke is cooler than Thor when you not only present Loke as decidely cooler and more relatable, but also significantly more powerful and smart?

Of course half your audience is going to end up rooting for the baddie (In this case, the purgers) when they're more charismatic, and seem to be having a better time, than your heroes. Who's going to aspire to become a hero if it's portrayed as a lifestyle that just absolutely sucks.",0,0,2017-11-27T19:19:02.000Z,Rakinjo2,UCDPlB9lt7F4FOvFmuzKLBmA,GADxdSVYdEM,True,UgxVkIRNYEzL7DTBcul4AaABAg

"The fuck dude. I didn't sign up for these feelings. 

You'll probably never see this but as a transguy this really resonated. It hurt, but it was a good hurt. That constant weight of a society telling you should be ashamed of yourself, that you're an unwanted abnormality. I think that most people understand that kind of feeling, but what really hit me with this video is the mirror of that feeling- The gravity of how it feels to, after living constantly smothered by that weight, be offered the idea that this terrible thing you're taught to feel shame for is something not just to be accepted, but celebrated, to be worshiped. 

To, even just for a little while, not feel guilty for existing. That feeling of throwing off that burden, that feeling of being presented so suddenly with something contrary to these painful beliefs you carry (and the idea that if this painful belief can be challenged so easily, can the other weights you carry not also be cast away?). And the idea that something as simple as not hating yourself for something you have no control over is so outlandish to most people that it's believable Satan himself would present it. So while it's uplifting to believe worshiping the self is a choice, it's painful that choice is so difficult to choose, is seen as so outlandish or selfish.

"in your segment regarding the director saying his depictions of brutality are fetishistic I think you arent viewing fetishism correctly. A fetishistic depiction of something isnt necessarily conventionally sexy as in it showing a titty or so. For example in Death proof you have a prolonged scene where a creepy old dude rubs his stubble against a girls feet. Now, tarantino is an obvious foot fetishist, but this scene isnt inherently sexy or anything, but i imagine it does the trick for someone who is into feet, even while being very uncomfortable and awkward considering your totally expecting the girl to wake up to someone rubbing their face on her feet. Gore and brutality fetishism as i know it generally focuses heavily on the person being  brutalized and their experience with being harmed, showing thrri physical reaction and even neglecting to show the actual injury in favor of depicting either the aggressor or the victim experiencing it. Discomfort is inherent to something violent and how are you gonna get off to that thing without portraying  it accurately",1,0,2017-11-13T15:27:02.000Z,explodingshroom,UCZJ7-VCbs_W5jBYXms9grqQ,hI0EdpoEDKo,True,UgzBWHZnpDrFYecyo5h4AaABAg

"I need HELP!!! I am looking two movies that I can't find anywhere, one of them it seems an horror movie where a quite child, a young boy or similar correctly dressed with a red bow tie sticks one fork in his own hand while dinnering front of some people. Some of the guys around says that nothing's wrong that he is fine while others try to help the boy but they are too scared to move on from their stairs, the boy lose consciousness under the pain and another weird person carry the boy up stairs. I can only rememeber that.

The second movie it seems a comedy-fantasy movie like time bandits where a girl is crossing the sea with her boyfriend standing on his back, just to reach one point in middle of the sea where they fight against a giant man, ( I don't know why but I' am convinced that this giant man is John Goodman but I must be wrong because I couldn't find nothing on his filmography).

"I have to think about movies like the christian ""War room"" and the 90's well...""moralic comedy""  ""Ghost dad"" with Bill Cosby. In the first a middleaged, black woman builts a prayer room in her wardrobe to get back her asshole, openly cheeting husband back with the love of christ. I just saw reviews, but it's hard to believe that awkward filmatic advise exist. I mean, there you don't even have a Maden character and a selfironic layer.

In ""Ghostwriter dad"" a Workaholic dad has to learn the lesson to appreciate his family. Mostly it's Sabine the teenage daughter from a boyfriend who's over the top evil. I mean evil like his first line when he's calling the daughter on the phone and tells the father he speaks first to ""get the bitch on the phone!"" I was shocked what big movie companies thought to be funny. Also regarding Cosby's own
crimes, it's so odd to see him as builts up hero like this...

"No, I know Madea.
I grew up on Madea Bootlegs & Madea plays, I'm pretty sure this is apart of Black American culture. Esspecially in poorer communities around america, the fucking salon I go to has all of these movies. The abuse isn't frowned upon. Child abuse is mostly accepted in our community...Like actually. No one likes talking about it, but this is how we deal with things- Corporal punishment, humor, and Jesus. *Not for everyone, but it is ingrained in the culture.*
Most of us aren't like, ""Oh this is a crazy parody..."" This is just a ...comedy. It's crazy to me, that this is really that crazy to you. Wild.
To be clear- We know Madea is wrong and over the top- but the message is sincere, and it's taken a such by majority of his target audience. You can see a lot of these sentiments reflected in early 2000's ""Urban"" movies and TV.

"Hi Nyx. Its funny everything you've said in this video because, if I'm honest, its how I came to enjoy your brand of video.
I started as a follower of NightMind and came across you in the occassional crossovers and Moonlight chats. 
When I first saw one of your videos I just couldn't get my head around and didn't come back.The strange mix of horror, absurdity and frequent breaking and repairing the 4th wall was hard to take seriously. 
Maybe I was being a bit to harsh in my judgement.
But like many things in life sometimes you need to aquire a taste for something. 
A year or so on from first watching one of your videos, a few more Moonlight chats to understand you as a person and the Eraserhead analysis with NightMind and I've come to enjoy your presentation style. Its unique, hard to wrap your head around but very personal and definitely not something you'd find anywhere else.

"Okay, finished the vid. I really appreciate the honest, objective analysis. Of course there's an element to these movies you didn't touch on, the black culture (and how it ties with the abuse), but I think you made the right call to focus on just the absurdity.

I myself love Madea. She's a hilarious character. However, I don't like the other characters and their drama much at all most movies. And then of course the colorist casting still bothers me so much...

These movies are at their best when they're focusing on Madea, her husband, and other obviously absurd recurring characters. I still laugh so much at Madea and her husband running from the police!

Rant though, that second Why Did I Get Married movie made me furious when I first saw it!! That ending was so BS, how could they just plop a happy ending on Jackson's character?? After all she went through and did throughout both films, that sudden rebound ending was too much! Don't even get me started one the other couples.

"It's so interesting to see this from a white perspective, because all of Tyler Perry's movies are comical exaggerations of the ""hood drama"" genre.

To you this is strange and gonzo, but this is symbolic of traditional American black culture and the black experience. These movies are successful because they're relatable.

Green Room is a great movie. You can tell the director really wears his love for genre on his sleeve.

"Oh man this movie is...is definitely an experience. I got a chance to see it this last weekend for free because a bulb burst for the projector that was going to be showing Bladerunner 2049. Honestly? I'm so glad I saw it, because it's the kind of movie you have to witness firsthand to just see the confused mess of editing.

I could really feel the potential of a decent procedural here too, something that had echoes of The Millennium series and definitely a lot of what made me love Let The Right One in painted throughout. The effects regarding wounds were really nicely done, and the landscape was bleak and added some decent tension.

However, when things failed, it failed with such a distracting amount of what-the-fuckery that it was hard to appreciate the good. That, and the incredible amount of wasted talent, plotlines that went absolutely nowhere, and a motivation to focus on women that really...didn't make much sense to me? After all, it made sense for the misogynistic nazi in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo to target the women he did, but not The Snowman, who was more wronged by the abandonment and abuse of men in his life than anything else.

...And Fassbender's name was Harry Hole. I legitimately thought it was a weird, childish joke or insult from the killer at first until it was used seriously by other police officers and on the rest of his mail.

"Shiiiiit, I didn't realise the theme of abuse is that ingrained in the story. That's amazing.
What I get out of the movie that makes is thoroughly enjoyable for me is the big focus on what scares the individual children.
The horror is almost tailored to potentially scar any unfortunate babby child who happens to see a clip of it, and I feel that much of the horror being portrayed are things that I too was deathly afraid of as a child, be it the basement, being chased up a staircase, the sight of abandoned houses, uncanny fucking PAINTINGS, and, of course, general childhood trauma.
In addition, the way the scares are employed in the movie makes use of just pure, over-the-top terror. It's not subtle in the least, which I think is entirely intentional because it's going for what would make a child just freak the fuck out in complete distress.
A theory I have is that the next Chapter will focus on a very different kind of horror pertaining more to what adults generally find horrifying with their very different understanding of the world. Creeping, existential dread, the fear of losing your mind or something like that, I dunno, it should probably vary depending on the character much like the first Chapter.
If they did do that, I'd go insane with excitement.",48,1,2017-10-02T16:51:57.000Z,Bruva Alfabusa,UCmiWoT3mqQMLFP9Hg420dsg,RqVd8vNadEU,True,Ugw8bnl4SlL8EuyEZOx4AaABAg

If you want to be pedantic (and I do, because it's all my degree in Music Composition is good for) it's more accurate to say 5/4 is 6/4 with one beat chopped off; it's why the theme to Halloween is set up 3-3-2-2.  It's a bit like the music is speeding up at the end of every measure without the tempo increasing.

The sense of lacking resolution has nothing to do with the rhythm; that's a result of the harmony.  It IS helping with the sense of relentlessness, though; it's the combination of the contracting rhythm and the harmony that keeps setting up a cadence and never really delivering it that creates the overall effect.

For other fun ways to subdivide 5/4, 2-2-3-3 creates the reverse effect (the music is stretching out and slowing down without the tempo decreasing) and 2-3-3-2 creates a rocking, swaying feel to the music.",13,0,2017-10-01T06:38:41.000Z,Camkitsune,UCLsan9ZYBczERgd8Ztuyhpg,lwv3FsFj3_M,True,Ugxfa5C09yxPrMU2oUd4AaABAg

"In the cluster fuck of a suburban suburbia where I live, a man on a main road no less, murdered his wife and put her under the floor boards - He would bring her dead body out and have sex with it. When the neighbor complained about the smell he killed her too...and popped her in under the floor boards with his dead wife -He had sex with them both on and off for 3 MONTHS before the cops were involved. Once he was arrested the community burnt the house on the main road to the ground. These days it is small park on the corner - very eerie driving past it.
Then also there is the famous case were 2 girls took there mother up the only hill here and bashed her to death with a rock in a stocking - They made that heavenly creatures film about it. (That was ages ago tho) 
So more recently some fricken dude conned a teenage boy with alcohol and freedom from his awful family then murdered him and chopped him up and buried him in pieces in the local cemetery, at the time it was like what are those blue tents and men in white doing at the cemetery? - come to think of it it wasn't too far from the necrophilia murder house.

"So, looking at this review, the overall narrative about what Halloween is about (The movie, not the holiday), the TL;DR take away from this would be that it's about sudden evil just springing up from seemingly nowhere. 

Learning this, Rob Zombie's reboot of Halloween comically misses that point almost entirely, and is less about that, and more about sociopathy as our current society and cultural zeitgeist sees it. Michael is demonstrated as being a classic sociopath, complete with animal torture, killing another child as a child, and then murdering a person who abuses him.Rob Zombie went to great lengths in order to make Michael something of a sympathetic character, completely doing away with ""Black and White"" in favor of shades of grey everywhere. 

If Halloween is a serial killer simulator, then Halloween the reboot is the progression of a serial killer, sped up to an unnecessary degree. 

Mostly everyone who died in Halloween the reboot died because they were an asshole. It's a more ""Traditional"" serial killer movie, where all the dumb, immoral people die and the good people somehow mostly survive.",0,1,2017-09-30T18:38:47.000Z,Absinthresher,UC9u21gzkYfyz3ZtNcTZRh_A,lwv3FsFj3_M,True,UgyGZfDO5PLGpQfJCrh4AaABAg

It hit like a freight train and a lot of sent me back, I'm sure it hits many people in the same way. I feel like this movie has a lot to say about bullying and abuse, how it doesn't matter who you are, if you're a little bit different people will pick up on it and tear you apart for it. There's something about victimisation and overcoming trauma and abuse, like overcoming what people do to you, other people's ignorance to your pain and coming together to overcome those things. I know the book had a bigger scope in the issues and bigotry it dealt with, but I think the movie focusing on child abuse was a great idea to have the movie saying one thing instead of something overarching about bigotry and the general evils of man, it's easier to follow and understand.

"I think my favorite theory concerning this film is that the curse is A) a hallucination brought on by severe malnutrition from an eating disorder or b) simply an allegory for having an eating disorder. 

Most of the events of the film do make sense in this perspective:

- Clues like Christine's mother's addiction and the picture of a chubby, young Christine in front of a sign saying 'Swine Queen' could point to a predisposition to certain personality traits and a possible self image problem. 
- Whenever food is introduced to a scene something supernaturally bad happens, and most of the supernatural occurrences in her house start in her kitchen. 
- Speaking of which Christine never eats in the movie. Ever.
- A lot of the gross stuff that happens with the old woman have to do with her mouth, including her literally vomiting dirt into Christine's mouth which could clue us in to what disorder Christine has - bulimia. 
- Excessive purging can also cause nosebleeds, which her malnourished brain blows out of proportion.  

Like the demon, Christine cannot escape her eating disorder, can't hand it off to others. Because she doesn't face it, she is doomed to be destroyed by it.

Now, I don't think Raimi intended the film to be viewed this way, but it is an interesting take.",12,0,2017-09-24T02:20:03.000Z,Nicholas Nace,UCvP85IBWesAcclS3T1OR1Xw,HXUJOw86yrU,True,UgwNR6_P_qfEuzNsHMl4AaABAg

"POTP is made up of some really great scenes but it's bizarre over-the-top technicolor macabre story-telling style does not make it an easy viewing.  With some more work it could have been a great film but every time I view it it seems to falls short of something I would really want to own. It exposes some truths about the music business and exploits myths and folklore, so that itself makes it an important movie as well as very much a period piece.  I think the film's greatest flaw was casting Paul Williams as the Devil's henchman because every time I watch a scene he's in I can't separate myself from the real Paul Williams.  That could also have been the director's intention all along.  The most attractive thing for me was featuring the impressive TONTO Synthesizer, even though it's use of restoring Winslow Leach's voice is total fantasy.

It was interesting to see the areas where they intersected and where they diverged and outright clashed even, in some cases. And in others, paralleled, but with very different phenotypes.

"Wow, this is a very thought-provoking theory, I never really saw Pennywise as a metaphor for systemic abuse, but now i can see where you're coming from. For me however, Pennywise is more a metaphor for Human follies (including but not limited to abuse) in general and fear, and when people let go of it, he's powerless. A big problem with this film though for me, was that Pennywise himself was simply...not scary. A big reason of why i find him not scary, is his design. In the miniseries, while Pennywise was more hammy than scary, when he was scary, it was because he looked like a normal, if slightly off, clown. And it also made sense that he would look more normal to entice children so he could catch them and eat them. But Pennywise in the 2017 film looks too intentionally scary, and i feel it ruins a lot of his uncanny valley-ness that was present in the book and miniseries. His behavior though is fantastic, especially the sewer drain scene, which to me was the only scene in which he was genuinely scary. Also His fuckin' dance made me bust out laughing, it reminded me of the duane gif where his head stays in the same place but his body keeps moving. Anyway, great video nyx, good analysis and 17 minutes well spent. -Cheers!",1,0,2017-09-11T02:10:49.000Z,TheSixthPulsar,UCwf1-EfyntFbPOBqiiFGb7w,RqVd8vNadEU,True,UgxBkxv0j2oG9FZyFlF4AaABAg

"Loved the movie, and I agree on the film being a metaphor for cycles of abuse. Another recent movie, IMO, that captured the theme of cycles of abuse is The Wolfman (The 2010 version.) I loved how the antagonist of that movie was the main protagonist's father, and how he passes his lycanthropy onto the only family member that he hadn't killed. There's definitely a tragic subtext to the film about how, oftentimes, survivors of abuse become unintentional abusers themselves having been nurtured in that environment.

"1) Ghost, super fucking cool. Favorite band. 
2) I never thought about the abuse metaphor within the story. I mean I just assumed it was meant to be a snapshot of most people's childhood. I mean everyone dealt with something horrible as a child, or so I believed when I read the book. Surprisingly enough as long ago as you did, almost exactly. I mean I dealt with a lot of shit as a kid so I assumed everyone did. Now that I'm older it makes a lot more sense. It wasn't until I got older did I realize that some of the shit that happened to me was super not ok. Even realized some of it is the route of some of my deepest fears. 
Like for a few years my aunt had this pool that my cousins and I would swim in and everything was peachy keen as long as the adults were around. When everyone turned their backs my cousins held me and my sister under the water for extended periods of time. One time my other aunt that lived next door called the aunt with the pool hysterical saying my cousins were going to kill me. I was never allowed back. I was starting to turn blue. To this day pool scare the everloving shit out of me unless I have a lot of control over how deep I go in. 
Later on at summer camp I jumped into a pool to do a swim test, and surprise surprise I couldn't swim. The lifeguards pulled me out and all the memories of being held under the water came back to me. I had forgotten because it all happened when I was relatively young. It was a frightening experience when I remembered all that stuff all over again. 
I can definitely see how it all fits together. Abuse and trauma creating deep seeded fears in kids.",29,2,2017-09-10T08:09:42.000Z,bleachsanchoblastk,UCiOPMG6G4VIPrldpxHCNohA,RqVd8vNadEU,True,Ugwah5bmo1PX89cg49F4AaABAg

Each of the kids sees Pennywise for the first time when they're already scared, usually because somebody older is threatening them somehow. Even Henry gets sent the knife after being threatened by his dad. The fear inspired by those closest to them brings them to It's attention.",0,0,2017-09-10T04:04:21.000Z,varying-degrees,UCCISZ_hwm8MVcb_MrA3m_nA,RqVd8vNadEU,True,UgyaPOX4BWh5U1XM3yd4AaABAg

"(First of all I'd just like to say thank you for this video. I saw the abuse but I'm a dumbo and didn't see how Pennywise was the personification of the cycle of abuse and your explanation made me look back and think more about this movie as a whole.)

I don't know if it was just the people in my theatre, but there was a lot of laughing. Specifically during the parts that were definitely aiming for horror. In a theatre that was almost completely full, about a third was laughing at many of the scenes of horror. I feel kind of bad because I honestly did not take this movie very seriously, and I wish I had because looking back on it there were moments of amazing imagery and just great horror and I think I would've found it much scarier watching alone in the dark, rather than in a theatre full of teenagers (granted I myself am 16).

Personally, what put me off and made me kind of give up on viewing it in a horror mindset was the first half. It seemed like there were way too many moments of ""oh shit gotta follow these horror tropes!"" and the bullying scenes were just so fucking ridiculous to me. Not to mention loads of cheap jumpscares.

Even considering my experience with watching this movie for the first time, I really fucking enjoyed it. The design of Pennywise is great and the shifting of forms to scare each individual child was pretty fucking cool.

I hope to be seeing it again, and with a new mindset because I do want this to scare me! As you said, ""seeing it in fresh eyes"" seems like the best way to view it.",0,0,2017-09-10T03:26:44.000Z,EmmettCozzy,UCHeE04MnM-Tq4cKDrInUxgw,RqVd8vNadEU,True,Ugw8YerqXBT2ve1hnz14AaABAg

"Horror needing a psychological element in order to be effectively scare: ABSOLUTELY. 
This is how I felt about watching the movie Oculus.

It was like I was seeing beyond the face-value horror w/ a scary mirror but the relatable horror of growing up with parents who were either never there or too distracted to care.

I disagree with the whole motive thing. I think it's way more fucked up to think that bad things are happening for no good reason. A good example is The Grudge/Ju-on or Last House on the Left. The reason those movies made so many people shit their pants is because there is no motive or reason just scary shit happening to them just because they were there/ saw a ghost.

"I just saw this movie last night so I'm super hyped to see you talk about it, and specifically what does IT represent? I know after the movie I immeidately was trying to figure out the allegory, because it was obviously one, and you put it into words for me. Sadly, I think Stephen King's works attract both deeply empathetic people who were the Loser's Club, and the bullies alike. Because in my theater there were the most obnoxious frat boy dickheads who were laughing at some super disturbing stuff. I even heard them chanting titties when the bullies were chasing Ben and laughing hysterically at the slut shaming thrown at Bev. It made me deeply sad, because I think part of the horror of the film was sheer human cruelty and our capacity to abuse one another. Even if the intent isn't necessarily malicious like with Eddie's mom pulling a Repo! The Genetic Opera and keep him close via fake illness. And yeah Pennywise scared the shit out of them, but they missed the point by laughing at the human cruelty. I also couldn't help but wonder what the Loser's Club would like if they were written now. I'd definitely include a gender queer or a gay kid, because having glasses is not enough to be considered a ""loser"" anymore.  And I dunno I find fears tied up into gender and sexuality especially fascinating which is probably why I found Bev's stuff the most nuanced. I really like how her fear was her own burgeoning femininity, but they did it in a really subtle way. 

PS: Why did you have to remind me it's been 7 goddamn years since I was in highschool what kind of existential nightmare that was almost a fucking decade what the actual fuck",0,0,2017-09-09T23:09:37.000Z,Rachel Glenn,UC864u5uQ1RsQlpYRh-4LGfA,RqVd8vNadEU,True,UgxpLBp645dNldcaEZx4AaABAg
"You know what scares me? My self-harm. It terrifies my mother, too, even though I'm nearly 30. It's pathetic, I'm a loser, but I wish I could find a creative outlet to show how... self-abuse is like living with an abuser, except you're doing it to you and you don't know why you're doing it, not all the time. But I think any way I could express it would meet the same reaction - that, even though I'm an adult, I'm a moron, going through a phase, looking for attention, etc. etc. Its scary, but it's such a normal part of my life, and my mum is just waiting for that call for when I go to deep, or take too many pills, and that terrifies me to think of, but it terrifies her more.

"I really like how this was done visually, but the whole philosophical side of satanism and the theme of this film turn me off massively. It's kind of a horror in itself that there are so many people down in the comments that agree with the idea of worshipping yourself, living only for yourself, being your own version of god. That kind of thinking is just fundamentally wrong to me, in fact it makes my stomach feel like it's churning to think about it in depth. It just reeks of our modern society's increasingly hedonistic mindset. And the fact that the main is and is played by a transgender person makes my thoughts of what this is even more complete.

"I believe personally the Winslow, Swan, and Phoenix represent the very worst of the aspects they're suppose to represent. Swan is obviously the corporate production side of music, Winslow is a stubborn artist, and Phoenix is suppose to be the rock star taking drugs and all that. At the end of the film it's only Phoenix who has grown and doesn't have Swan manipulating her anymore. Which in my opinion means that the art was great, even due to the conflict between Swan and Winslow, and Phoenix still performs the art without being a stereotypical rock star.

"I saw this movie on cable in the middle of the night, back when VHS tapes were still a thing. I found it so bizarre and compelling that I tried to tape as much of it as I could. But you couldn't get it anywhere back then, and no one I talked to about it has ever heard of it. If I hadn't had that bit of tape, I'd have thought I hallucinated it.

"While I definitely agree with you that this movie is great, I have a few disagreements that I'd like to address.

First of all... I honestly could not stand John as the protagonist. He was so tenacious, so ridiculously zealous for attention and popularity. His desire to be liked, to create things that people like, completely went against the grain of everything that the band members stood for. In the end, every terrible thing that happened was a result of his egregious nature and his inability to pull his head out of his own ass. He seems to me like one of those people who likes the smell of his own shit.

Secondly, and this one is seriously opinionated... I actually really enjoyed the music that the Soronprfbs created. It reminded me of some of the experimental music that came out of the sixties and seventies. They were making what they liked, what they wanted to make, what they enjoyed. It's not that they didn't know what they were doing, it's that they didn't care about appealing to typical music standards, and I actually really appreciate that. I think that might be why I have no sympathy for John. He had no respect for what they were making, and was always searching for a way to shape it to his liking. Rather than going with the flow, and appreciating it in all its weird, unconventional glory.

Other than that, this is a really solid review! I really enjoyed this film, and I hope other people loved it just as much.",1,1,2017-08-17T22:46:53.000Z,Nels Bels,UCnl0x4DIdk3E5ZIFnexUAOw,ftp2mxwCop4,True,Ugy27OB_c9DQyP7qroB4AaABAg

"I got a very final destination feel from the way this movie did its death scenes. The part that made it better was that it didn't present itself as a final destination film, so it mostly just throws us off once that happens. Also, I thought at 2:45 you implied that there was a connection between the deaths, but you didn't explain it, so it seems I thought wrong. Having the deaths of the characters be connected in some way would have made me feel more satisfied, but oh well. I thought the premise was kinda dumb just cause it sounds like something that's already been done to death, but I'm glad it's laughable.


I'm glad you said at 1:25 that you appreciated the main character's willingness to stand up for herself. Logically speaking, in a story in which the character's primary conflict is to essentially defy death, they have to be willing to escape their comfort zone. One of the major factors in the mind's motivation for self-preservation is its ability to strip someone of their individuality to surpass their normal behavior so they instead act as something which is trying to survive at all costs. This is why people who are starving tend to not be picky eaters, since their mind understands that they need nutrients for self-preservation. The mind is capable of causing the person to impulsively attempt to satisfy its requirements, even if that means they have to eat another one of their own species. I feel like there's a term for this fundamental idea, but I don't know what it is. Also, I apologize if that didn't make sense due to the time at which I wrote this comment out.


Regardless, I am also disappointed that she apparently contradicted her own personality as the film went on for seemingly no reason other than out of plot convenience, which tends to be a major issue in quite a number of films lately. I didn't really want to spend time watching it either cause of how overused the plot device is, so honestly thanks for doing it for me.",0,0,2017-08-11T10:19:36.000Z,Alph Blishtarl,UC5UfpEF0IHmdgE7h3CuKXTg,4zgr8hslH-U,True,UgxPhYYUrrBr9QFVhJJ4AaABAg
"Welp, I really liked this one. Never actually saw the movie myself, but the way you describe it sounds incredible. Another comment I read also said that apparently she was tricked into completing certain acts which became the catalyst for her damnation. As much as I would have preferred that she had gotten away with it in the end (because why should the gypsy's desire for revenge be stronger than the protagonist's desire to continue her life?), the fact that this was apparently just a ritual that the gypsy was capable of tricking her into makes it sound so much more interesting to me, and the fact that since it's still a horror movie, it has a hopeless conclusion (which isn't a necessity, but can be refreshing to see).

"This movie 'spoke' to me...I saw it twice. I suppose the song is a substantial element of that appeal. In order for a movie to 'work' for me, the movie must compel me to make an emotional connection with the narrative or characters, and there has to be an emotional 'payoff' at the end, a catharsis. 'A Ghost Story' does that for me.

Why do they feel the need to have it only to attempt to destroy it when they tried to do that when they were kids? I thought it was an interesting story but the lead actor was pretty annoying to my friend and myself. I really wanted to like the movie, and maybe there were some things I missed, but I felt that the only reason the movie was made was for an attempt at ""shock value"" like the mother's torment, the abusive father, the girl eating a lightbulb, etc...",1,0,2017-08-06T21:08:08.000Z,Samuel Alaster,UCwYT6iEJxM81l1yy1Tbxr6g,RXedjcJe1BU,True,Ugxt6xHMVBXo_mvvyiV4AaABAg

TL;DR The Thing probs creeped you out cuz he gots crazy eyes, and they really pop in the art style, considering the artist's use of ink to make everything sort of muddy grey, but his eyes are bright white.

"The one that scared me the most (and still keeps me on my toes) was the story High Beams. At least that's what I think the name was. The story follows a woman driving at night or early morning and the car behind her keeps flashing their high beams into the car of the young woman. Come to find out once she reaches her destination that the follower had been warning her about a man hiding in the backseat of her car. Each time their high beams came on, the man was about to strike the woman. I always check my car before getting inside, especially early in the morning before work.

But since I have since seen the trailer about 35 times, it feels so overplayed and pretentious that I cannot look past how much I have grown to hate the trailer.

"Interesting how Christine was thinking about repenting/going to church, and then those leaves swirled and led her to Rham Jas...who then gains her trust with his little performance, and then proceeds to persuade Christine to practice black magic, blaspheme the dead and make an animal sacrifice. I think that Rham Jas was an accomplice of the devil. 
Was the button just a red herring? I think Christine was just put on a three day trial that she initially would have passed, but she gradually incriminates herself as the haunting becomes more intense. There's a lovely little bit of symbolism in the start of the film that explains that, and this is when Christine removes the paper clip from Clay's printer, and prevents him from just throwing it out. It was just a tiny blemish in this big, expensive machine and it just took a little investigating...no need for drastic action.
Such a multi-layered film and so very underrated. The ending just about stopped my heart. Completely unexpected (yup, I expected something different) and totally heartbreaking. The conversations between Christine and Clay felt so realistic! Like, that's how I would expect a couple to talk when one if being genuinely haunted, and the other suspects they're experiencing PTSD, but doesn't want to aggravate them anymore.",0,0,2017-07-30T09:01:37.000Z,S M,UCRTTNWxFOCo8DPDR26rCp_Q,HXUJOw86yrU,True,UgirWLgDjQaSqXgCoAEC

"I remember people laughing at the ridiculousness that was annabelle as well. That elevator scene got everyone laughing. It's the long drug out tense scenes where you think it's going to end but it keeps going and going until it's parody level stuff. 
There was a lot of pacing problems. With the first few deaths there was a lot of tension. I mean the whole time I was expecting something to pop out as a cheap scare, but the director lets it ride out so far its so tense even if the ways people die are ridiculous. There are just too many threads in the story to explore everything with the time it needed. Entire pieces of the story could be cut out in order to give everything it's own space and it just doesn't happen. I did have fun watching it, but it felt like they were trying to do too much with too little time. 
I mean there was a whole shopping montage that could have totally been cut out and it wouldn't have changed a thing. There was also this bully that immediately gets fucked up and she totally disappears until near the very end. It was going too many places at once. I mean they could have split the movie into two, using some of the story elements in the next person who got the box instead of cramming it all into one movie. 
All that being said I thought it was going to be a really plain teeny bopper pg-13 flick for the kiddos. They tend to be really boring and not even worth watching but this one felt satisfying enough. Usually there isn't enough story, but this one had too much.

"I like how you're a nerd about lighting and......technicality. I'm like that with movies, too, but I'm not familiar with all those terms. I just pay attention to scenery, background stuff, and the number of perspectives the camera takes. Which brings me to this question: Have you seen John Wick 2? That movie was fucking amazing and after watching an interview on it, I realized why I like it so much. One of the big things for me was the number of cameras. Action movies usually having perspectives switching constantly to simulate a bunch of action when nothing is really happening. Just like dance movies. The cameras just switch around really fast to fool you into being intertwined when really you can't see what the fuck is going on. John Wick and jw2 relied on real choreography and great acting and stuff. I like movies like that.

"This movie is the closest I've ever had to a religious experience. It was... marvelous. I guarantee, soon to be a modern masterpiece.

--SPOILERS--

I viewed the movie one day after the official release in theaters. I went with two other friends. One of the things I immediately noticed was that the theater had maybe 8 people in there. 15, tops, including ourselves. In other words, the theater was fucking EMPTY. Granted, this was a matinee, so it's to be expected that the room would not be as full, but to see such a large room with so few people was startling to say the least. Which is a shame, because in all honesty, the movie was wonderful. (Just not in the way the film makers intended...)

Wish Upon is like that drunk aunt at the wedding. No one really likes her, but she acts too erratic and honestly INSANE in her drunken stupor to not be entertained. The death scenes literally made everyone laugh in the theater. Everyone. Which wasn't very many, but still. 

Even though it's unintentionally hilarious, the plot is really predictable. At one point, my friends and I made bets about what would happen. ""She's a teenage girl, of course she's going to wish for money, popularity, and a boyfriend."" You could argue that this wouldn't have fit with the character at the beginning of the movie, but it happened anyway. Because... magic? The girl (I forgot her name, so I'll just call her Pants) gets stalked. ""I bet the boyfriend is the one doing it."" AND IT HAPPENS. The same thing kept consistently happening where I could predict the plot points. The few surprises I did have were in the executions of said plot points.

The best part, though, was definitely the end. That part where Pants kisses Asian Guy and backs away, giving him the box. Not even looking where she's going. Into the middle of the road. I kept thinking, ""Oh my God... they're going to pull a Regina George. They're going to pull a Mean Girls!!"" I could barely contain my excitement. And they did. They did do a Regina George. She got ran over by a car. Driven by the movie's equivalent of an actual mean girl, no less. 

And it wasn't JUST that she got hit by a car. It was the manner in which she got hit by a car. Pants rocketed into the air, landing right into another car. Upon launch, Pants resembled much of a rag doll. She was limp, but the motion was quick. And I'm not the type to find slapstick funny. But they should show this scene to film makers in school to illustrate how to properly do slapstick. Because it was actually THAT good.

And then the after credits scene. Asian Guy is digging a hole, about to bury Mister Box. I, my friends, and the rest of the theater rose up in our seats. We chanted ""Sequel. SEQUEL. SEQUEL!!!"" together in unison. At that moment, Asian Guy decides to analyze the box and reads the ancient Chinese (because they had a Chinese class at the high school... like that's a common elective???). He reads, ""Seven wishes..."" Then the film fades. And everyone raucously applauds.

That moment of agreement within that group of movie goers restored my faith in humanity. We were united. We were ONE. If we can join together to watch a shit movie and enjoy it, anything is possible. So please, watch this movie. It will unite the human race if we all could just watch it together and agree that Wish Upon is an enjoyable piece of steaming zebra shit.

Great movie. 10/10. 5 stars. Best comedy of the year. Deserves its own Criterion release.

"I'm so glad to see House and Tetsuo on this list; their a couple of my favorite Japanese unsettling films!  For anyone fascinated by Tetsuo and other strange and highly figurative pieces of splatter/cyber punk, I'd highly reccomend Meatball Machine (2005) and Malice@Doll(2001).  Both are intriguing takes on the intersection of organic life and mechanical infrastructure, in which humanity is just an interchnageable part with machinery. 
     Meatball Machine is live action with a modern setting and filled with absurdist moments of action while delving into themes of love and human agency in modern assembly line culture... I could go on for quite some time on this.   
     Malice@Doll is a mixed media 2d/3d animated OAV in which we are presented in a post-human world where robots still function to maintain a rotting structure, one sex-doll drone attempts to find life and meaning in a world where her function is unnecessary.
     I've always found Japanese cyberpunk an intriguing inversion of western cyberpunk.  Technology seems to be more of a neutral force while a biological infestation and merging with technology tends to be the more frightful force.  It's not the evil AI that wants to destroy humanity but the machines taking on the primal force of life and subsuming mankind that is to be feared.",0,0,2017-07-24T20:53:05.000Z,Guardian Beast,UCagumkb2JjfzksPju99qmxQ,o_Xmls-s7Og,True,Ugj5OiMze5hxD3gCoAEC

"Well to start I want to say I enjoy your videos, you seem like you would be capable of directing a good horror movie with your ideas on what to do and what not to do with characters and plots ect. The blair witch project is my favorite horror movie of all time and will never forget seeing it for the 1st time when I was 9 or 10 years old, thought it was real for like 5 years after it came out. The new blair witch is a good movie and had the right idea for the plot but the JUMP SCARES piss me off....especially watching at the movie theater when the volume is jacked all the way up. Jump scares are cheap non scary bullshit that should never be used more then once in a movie. Another thing that pissed me off in the new BW is the non scary hollywood sound effects at night....they would have been way better off using the same noises as the original BW and adding some non hollywood sound effects but instead they have a pack of coyotes sound which they try to make it seem like ghost but to a hunter like me I knew what the sound was soon as I heard it. Another issue I have is the actors...my goodness they couldn't of found better actors and better names then ""Peter"". The only good actors are Lisa and maybe lame. last issue is the time setting and location....I know during the summer it makes the woods seem fuller but I think during the fall makes for a better looking movie and scarier, also the location...why would there be hiking trails all through an area that isn't supposed to be visited often. Other then everything I mentioned I think it's a good scary movie (10000x better then book of shadows) and would recommend people to watch it but there is missed opportunities and bullshit acting and jump scares.",1,0,2017-07-24T03:46:10.000Z,Pitt Burgh,UCiUBP92Hn9y-lfIwaA8-LzQ,PFPtHaNL7B8,True,UghnDhufbgo72ngCoAEC

Anyhow, good analysis. Now I dare you to find artistic merit in ""Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III"" AKA the most artistically bankrupt installment of the original Chainsaw series.

As for Tobe Hooper's original, if you've seen Hooper's first feature length film ""Eggshells"", OG Chainsaw actually works as a great death kneel to the early 70s flower child culture that was seen in Hooper's previous film.
