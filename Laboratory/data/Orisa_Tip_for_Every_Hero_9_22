You forgot one thing and it is when you engage in a 1v1 always place a barrier in front of you so the enemy has to move closer to counter tracer or reaper or road hog or anyone else is to play ring around the Rosie with your barrier and try and land headshots on them (unless they are very skilled players),0,0,2018-08-18T20:10:11.000Z

I love these videos, to be honest. Only one I felt didn't really teach me was the tracer video... whoever was featured for that was great playing as her, but gave little to no tips against matchups.

"@karq

This is primarily a good example of how a tips video should be.  Prompts to EvilToaster !

Unfortunately some of the guests have wasted hero tips due the lack of good information and exceptional tips. I wanted to say that long ago but I really had wished you had never called some people to make videos. I wish you could remake some videos because they were a waste of time for your series while some have been incredibly informative to the player base (XQC, Jardio etc).
