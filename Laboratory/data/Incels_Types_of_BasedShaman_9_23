"I have to say when it comes to incels it really does seem to boil down to them not being a productive member of society and atleast try to do something more with their lives, as you mentioned it's not all on the outside, and I get it some people have social anxiety I was one of those people but I was fortunate to find a friend who helped me come out of my shell, I got a job way before I was the legal age to work and when I was finally 16 a got a part time job went to school, got into a good social circle (well several I was one of those guys that could get along with any of the stereotype group of the high school of which we all know, goths, jocks,peeps, emos, nerds, etc) and kept my head up I had alot of good relationships and incels need to stop seeing women as a squish mitten and more of a companion.  Find someone who you can look up to, or try and find a friend who can guide you to being the best you even if it doesnt happen right away. 

And as you said hook your friends up not only with girls but companions and already try and end a relationship on good terms if possible.

I think that it's also important to note that you may have friends that are close to being an incel.

"Regarding shortcels, I think guys of all sizes are great! That's just my opinion, though. üôÉ

Tall Guys: You can borrow their hoodies and they'll be really oversized and comfy!!

Same Size: You can borrow each other's hoodies and they'll fit comfortably no matter what!

Short Guys: They can borrow your hoodies and look super cute in them!! Bonus points if it's pink!!

And all of these can be said about girls, too!!

Conclusion: SIZE DOESN'T MATTER!! Love yourselves, no matter your height!! üòä

Also, weight shouldn't matter, either!! A lot of people are into that sort of thing!! Thicc is good as long as it doesn't get out of hand and become super unhealthy!!

"I can almost relate to this, in the sense that I used to have a bit of a complex with my height. I'm 1,76 metres (I think that's 5'9 in your system, I have no idea, your system is weird af, guys. No offense). But I have always liked tall girls. My height, a little bit shorter than me or even taller than me. But always believed that tall girls only dated even taller guys. The first girl I liked was 1.80 meters. I was scared as fuck to tell her because I thought she will just laugh at me. She eventually found out what I felt because a friend of mine tried to ""found out if she felt the same way, but maybe I was a bit too obvious"" (idiot) and cornered me to make me tell her. You know what happened? We started dating. My next GF was 1,77 meters. She had no problem with it. I think up to this day, I still feel a bit insecure about my height. Specially when I go to Germany, because the average height there is really different than in Argentina. In Argentina an average male's height is 1,74. In Germany I think it is almost 1.79. But I'm slowly working on it. I think the one thing that I realized is that tall girls are not heartless monsters. Even if I didn't exactly thought that, the idea that a girl would laugh at me, just because I was shorter than her, says that I thought of them as basically heartless monsters. I'm sure there are hundreds of tall girls that won't date short guys. But they won't laugh at you for trying. They will gently tell you that they are not interested and that is perfectly fine and it's not a hit to your self-esteem. I think sometimes situations in our heads are a lot worse than in reality. You just need to take a gamble and realise that most girls are not cruel. They don't want to make you feel bad, they don't like to break hearts, they don't want to hurt your self-esteem. They just want to live their lives their way and date whoever they want, just like everybody else. It is almost as if incels didn't think of girls as human beings, they think of them as robots.

"I never got the height thing, I'm 5'7"" and I have _never_ thought of myself as short or been self conscious about it, and I certainly have never felt it has ever limited me. I always felt pretty normal, and I'm perfectly fine with normal. 

Haha I always find myself commenting on these videos because I seem to have a lot to say on the topic. Probably because I have always found it hard to find love in life, and yet I kept trying and have found it before and I'm sure I will again hopefully. I must admit that the late 20's dating world has left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. But recently I think I may have met someone that could go somewhere, way too early to get a good sense for it though. 

The fact for us guys who like to live walking in the opposite direction of the rest of the pack is we have to find the women out there who do the same. Now I'm not trying to say that doing so makes us special or anything, it is just the reality of our personality and the way we choose to live. A lot of the time it can seem like they don't exist, and then when you least expect it one pops out of the crowd.

As you said, at the end of the day if a girl doesn't want to date you because of something as shallow as genes, then her turning you down is actually doing you a massive favour. Yes, to some extent we are creatures controlled by a desire to pass on our genes with someone who also has good genes. However incels take that reality and blow it way out of proportion, plus there's the fact that we aren't highly evolved apes living in caves anymore just trying to survive pass on our genes. We have envolved into a species that takes many other things into account when choosing a partner that they never did, and to some people there are traits they value more than simple genetic viability and resources. 

Personally I want nothing to do with anyone who values either of those _too_ highly.

Some incels may say that women just can't help it, they are programmed to seek out those traits. Well what I would respond with is that being able to recognize that we are predisposed to value those traits gives us the ability to overcome our programming.",0,0,2018-09-02T02:16:09.000Z

"You have a rare hypnotizing Male Voice. You know, the kind a Used Car Salesman or Real Estate Broker or a Snake Oils Salesman would always seek.  Most of your Videos overall are depressing.  However, at the same time with bits of humor  Agree with you on that Elliot Roger should have pursued Non White Women.  White Women as far as I am concerned on average tend to be Overweight and only a small % of them are physically attractive.  Elliot Roger and his types that complain about lack of available and willing Women probably should have an interest in Non White Women.  Pretty Black Women IMO are on average a bit more receptive.  Asian Women especially East Asian Women are often more receptive to White Men.  However, they may be more difficult to open up as they are much more influenced by family standards.  Honduran, and El-Salvadoran Women tend to be cute and are usually a tiny bit more receptive than the average White Woman.  Brazilian, Ecuadoran and Peruvian Women are top notch too.  

Problem that Incels seem to consistently complain about the lack of receptive Women when in reality is that they only prefer White Women  and then only a certain attractive level of White Women Which are already limiting by the numbers of them that are available in the first place.

The thing about doing workout is that it's not just how you look in the end. Exercising (especially cardio) releases in body all sorts of hormones that reduce stress and put you in the good mood. Also that feeling of pump after working out with weights is great. You could try going to the gym (or do any other physical activity) just for that.,0,0,2018-08-29T18:03:34.000Z

Being proper short does suck. I'm 5ft 2 and it has really taken a hit on me.  A lot of general teasing over short guys makes it an isolating experience. People treat me differently for sure; but a lot of it comes from inside. A guy I know about as tall as me is confident as fuck and just gets on with it. Doesn't linger on things he can't change. He just keeps moving forward. people treat him fine because he projects a welcoming personality.  All you can do at the end of the day is strive for change and accept yourself because you'll never change these things.,0,0,2018-08-29T10:28:28.000Z

"Out of all of them imo, shortcels are the most tragic ive met . I think they blow it out of proportion for sure. Sure, alot of girls do like taller guys, but there also are alot that dont care at all. And even some of the ones that do care will test you to spot that insecurity. I‚Äôm average height, and one weekend, about a month ago, I was in a bar with some friends and we were having a good time. I started talking to this girl and she flat out told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre cute and all but its a shame you‚Äôre not like 6‚Äô3‚Äù so I looked at her, laughed and went back to hang out with my friends, eventually talking to another girl i met sometime later. And imagine my face when the girl who basically told me I was too short found me again later that night and wanted to continue talking. Your attitude plays a huge part in attraction for sure, as soon as Shortcels stop selling themselves short, or Incels in general stop with their toxic ‚Äú all wahmen r cancur‚Äù mentality, they‚Äôll see improvements for sure.",0,1,2018-08-29T03:53:19.000Z

"To answer the one person's question about how to keep them from going down that path:
Honestly, befriend them. Bottom line is befriending them. Another thing is not only getting them interested in your hobbies, but getting interested in theirs as well, quid pro quo. For some that's blatantly obvious, but for others that does need to be said. 

I think one of the biggest hurdles that those that are cells or are dangerously close to becoming one is the lack of self-confidence regardless of body type. This, of course, involves talking to both sexes comfortably and primarily for sexual advances (that obviously applies primarily towards women). Even more so for those that they are interested in attempting to start a relationship with if they do click on a hobby or friend level.

Now I tell people what I like and find people that share my interest, even make people try the things I like because I talk about it with passion, make some ""Chads"" watch Madoka M√°gica hahaha... The PUA community is full of good advice, but is also full of misogyny and really bad mindsets and ideas... I regret things I said or did following that ideology, but it was what saved me... Now I try to help people find themselves, give the good advise (love yourself, stop seeking validation, you are worth the same as any women, your father and anyone is wrong about what you can accomplish, you must try, women will give you a chance, there are 7 billion people on Earth so it doesn't matter if 100 reject you, improve yourself, you already think in all the bad scenarios your neurotic mind create, now create some ridiculously good ones and realize they are equally possible) of the PUAs without the bad...

"It's weird looking back at my Instagram a few years ago, I was a gymcel. It's so fucking stupid, because I looked better then now than I did then. There was one video, it was silver dollar deadlift for reps, there was about 600lbs on the bar, my chest and shoulders were striated, abs were popping beneath the belt, bicep veins were out. It was hand down my best condition, yet mentally I was in absolute tatters. I'd walk to the gym foaming at the mouth, then walk home seriously contemplating suicide.

What I will say, is that, yes I did have very serious self esteem issues. But... My current girlfriend is kind, caring, and actually texts me back within at least a few hours. It was the fault of the women around me, before you shout me down, hear me out. I couldn't be blamed for being polite then stood up, I couldn't be held accountable for them suddenly cutting all contact (I genuinely wasn't being weird). I'm past it, but sometimes there are factors beyond self esteem, such as my aforementioned rotten luck. A girl who I went on three dates with told me she wanted to get her college work done, so I waited for a month, untill her course was done, she took me on another date and told me she wasn't interested anymore (she didn't even have the decency to not string me along). I told her I wanted a reason, this had happened before, it was a repeat behaviour and clearly there was a common factor, something I could fix about myself.  Apart from that I had been stood up at least nine times by different women, some of whom apologised, most of whom  just stopped responding. Yet without changing a fucking thing, I find the gem in the pile of shit, the one good thing in my life.

I realize how arrogant and one sided this seems, but what reason would I have to lie? I look back and realise I've been way too hard on myself these years.",0,0,2018-08-29T01:33:48.000Z

"As far as shortcels go... I'm 5'2"" and I've certainly dated many tall guys (6ft+)... But I'm currently dating someone who is 5'6"" and it's actually much nicer. Things line up a lot more nicely. Hugs don't seem so far away and smooching is much easier (I only have to go on my tip toes a little bit). 

I also dated a 5'4"" guy in the past, but we didn't break up because he was short, we broke up because he wouldn't get a job and I got tired of supporting both of us for almost a year. But that's a whoooole other story haha.

Anyway, if you're a particularly short girl and haven't considered dating a short guy... Definitely go for it. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1,4,2018-08-28T23:31:14.000Z
