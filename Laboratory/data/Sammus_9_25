"I wanted to thank you for writing this song. It brought about a major breakthrough for me.

Backstory:
Two months ago I left my girlfriend and fianceé of 8 years because she not only stopped wearing her ring but started sharing her bed with another man. I stayed for a year and a half after she started doing it because I believed I was being devout and it turns out I was being codependent. I also have bipolarism, clinical depression, and anxiety. The stress of leaving her and feeling more alone than I have in years sent me to a mental hospital last Thursday. They gave me new meds and thankfully didn't commit me. The next day I was driving to a local event when this song came up in my playlist followed by Mighty by MegaRan. Halfway though 1080P,  I broke down crying tears of joy because I realized that I truly could be a better me without her. That I could get better. Then started balling all over again when Mighty came on because I realized the truth that I am Mighty. When more money comes in I'll start going back to my therapist again soon to clear out my rose tinted glasses and truly see the world in all of its vibrancy. 

Tldr: Thank YOU for helping me own my turf and to start seeing my world in 1080P.",7,5,2017-10-17T03:15:58.000Z,Djaq Harris,UCjM2-uPNyfeTflpR1sroUtA,bjhRvQM-wiw,True,UgwOVYbZsru-My7-0ml4AaABAg

"I just discovered you this week and momma you give me LIFE. I'll skip the platitudes about your beauty as your music and skill is what has me entranced and what I want to focus on.

I listened the to the entire Another M album and I did not expect the emotion to be so strong. I laughed, I cried, I fell into despair only to have you spin jump me back into the highs of delight. I cannot help but compare your emotion to the old rock star Poe and the raw realness of Missy Elliot along with the underground sound of Leikeli47 and Junglepussy. The number of inside jokes, references, and pure undiluted power came at me like a super saiyan and crushed my face into a million pieces only to rebuild me into a better man.

I saw your pic on the MAGfest musician page and silently got hype at my desk. Will def be makin an effort to come out for that. Also, this is kinda late but I think it's cool that you ask what artist's fee is. Its awkward as an artist to have ask folks for money because you never know how sensitive folks are about it or if they truly value your craft. As a dancer, a lot of ppl always say ""you'll get exposure"" or just look at you crazy for askin lol. Exposure is what social media is for haha I want some damn money to expose my tank to some gas or provide my stomach with exposure to food. Whoa this is way too wordy.....

"This post is full of (hopefully constructive) criticism. So read or ignore as you see fit.

First off,this music is kind of a slow roll. I'd suggest using it for an introduction theme. Basically talking about who Samus is,what she does,and building up the ""galactic bad ass"" deal. An introductory song,if you will.

This I would do faster. Samus is running the levels,gathering power ups,getting her shit together and getting ready for the big fight. So you want something faster but not shoot out fast. Something like this.
