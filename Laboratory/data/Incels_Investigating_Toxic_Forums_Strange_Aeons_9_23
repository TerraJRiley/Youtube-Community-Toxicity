"lmao. the irony is that you mock these people for things that are prevalent in your approach of incels. 
you made no attempt to actually follow up with the Wikipedia sources and just read a portion of the post that reaffirmed your claim. but mocked the fact that they used a wiki source. then you said that ""roped"" meant raped. which is misinformed and misleading. the term is a part of their idea that you either cope with being an incel or you rope (commit suicide). 

you come off as being no different than the people you are making fun. you just seem to have better social skills. the funny part is you seem to suffer the same issue as these people. you find strength  in hate for another because you yourself feel inadequate. and ultimately look for like minded individuals to reinforce your narrative by sharing your ideas with them.",0,0,2018-09-23T16:33:29.000Z

"I'm incel in it original definition, and   find the incel community absolutely pathetic. it's sad because I've been there and understand now why they are like that. Most time those people are extreme social incompetent. I got hate toward women when I was 19, but now I got maturity and I'm full feminist and understood me I got problems, not women. It began when more and more female said me I'm cute or sexy and but I failed to get any date. Then I realized I did not have a problem with women, but with men too, with everyone, everyhuman. How can you get women if you have zero, i say you ZERO, social interactions, zero friends, no social life at all, how can you get date at all? I worked a lot on my physical appearance and got nothing.  I noticed that some ugly guys were having relationships with uber sexy women, and some not sexy men, no abs, fat arm, geek clothing, were hooking up 10 women in their workplace. My jaw dropped off. So everything is friend, social network, personality and be cool. Those incel are just creepy. You can't get girls if you say things like ""in the end, rape is not so bad' lol. Many of those suffer social isolation, and social anxiety, but for some the mix of frustration, sadness and ignorance (especially lack of self knowledge) bring anger and put them into hate ideology.",1,0,2018-09-20T13:08:20.000Z

Then 9months ago she said she had feelings for me and my mind just exploded, like ""Holly shit.... She does? What...?"". I didnt know how to feel so I took some time to think about it, and I realized that I do have feelings for her(it took me about a month to realize this, and I told her I feel something but that I need to figure things out and make sure I dont feel this just as a reaction to what she said). And yeah, now, for around 8-9 months we have been in a relationship, and it is so amazing, we are seriously in love, and are really passionate to eachother. I always wanted something like that, but I never fucking knew I could have something amazing like this. Btw I think she is way out of my league, but she doesnt think that. I mean I know im kinda cool I guess, but it always baffled me that such an amazing girl both physically and mentaly actually feels something SO strong towards me. Moral of the story-DONT. EXPECT.

Would get mad when I would run away after having a dick flung out at me after saying I wasn't interested in seeing it(the few that I guess at least asked. Tho didn't listen so for what that's worth) and that's just how 90% of them even attempted to start taking to me. And then they'd say things oh come on if we fuck at least you can get off the street for an hour or so. None of them even had the intention on l letting me sleep there if I slept with their grime asses. So no I got to say that horny men didn't rescue me from the street. They just made the worst time in my life even harder because I had to be more than hyper aware, more than polite about it. It didn't matter if I explained I was tired dirty gay trying to get to a job interview NONE of them would take no for an answer and all of them thought that the offering of their dicks was the prize I was winning. The fact that no one can hear a no thanks without getting angry is terrifying. I never get any sleep nowhere is safe... And anyone who thinks that sex is equally pleasurable to men and women just by getting pounded tells me that your sex is not the prize you think it is. As a man you are A) programed to procreate any and everything and B) get off every time from the most vanilla version of the act the woman A) is programmed to be choosy since she can only get pregnant 1 time and then has to use her body as eggshell yolk and incubator which is all a strain and potentially dangerous etc B) without a thoughtful lover it's a waste of my time to take that risk. If you aren't even getting off and the possibility of becoming an incubator with legs there's literally nothing in it for the woman on it's face. 
Yes I suppose if other agreements on different things were made before hand then having bad sex for some kind of material gain isn't a huge end of the world. But literally no dude if offering to take care of you in any way shape or form or turn you into a house wife etc. They just want a hit it and quit it and are offended when it's not that easy. Are disgusted at 'whores' etc. Well if you aren't bringing anything to the table but your dick there's nothing in it for the other side to risk it. Were biologically programmed to cost benefit analysis your proposition. An hour in shelter in your moms basement or 1994 Saturn is not a high enough benefit for the risk it entails.

I had a traumatic head injury while I was working as a Community Support Worker (I helped teach people with mental disabilities how to live, oh and I had to get a BA to get this job) and after suffering with really bad post concussion syndrome for a year it developed into chronic pain syndrome (meaning I am in debilitating pain all day, every day, for the rest of my life) that will never be cured.
 When I say debilitating, I mean I am physically disabled and unable to work anymore because without strong painkillers it hurts to breathe; I literally can't eat or sleep if I don't take my medication. Also, I am genetically resistant to painkillers and CAN'T get high from any opioid pain medication. 

I also have to forever carefully monitor my medication because I already almost died from Serotonin Syndrome because one of the pain clinic doctors was not paying close enough attention to my doses of SSRIs and prescribed me an overdose (PS: I almost died because the fucking paramedic thought I was lying about going through Serotonin Syndrome due to a pain clinics mistake and I was just tripping on E. The RN also believed the paramedics, so I was lying for 6 hours slowly dying as my body was cooking itself from over heating. I was hallucinating, stuttering, confused, in horrible pain and it was all I could do to just keep repeating, ""serotonin syndrome, please give benzodiazepine."" (Benzodiazepines counteract Serotonin syndrome) I was just about to start seizuring or go into cardiac arrest when my Dad finally got into someone's face and forced them to call my Family Doctor to vouche for my story when my Dad realized they were refusing to help because they thought I was doing recreational drugs). 

Worst part about chronic pain conditions is that even if your Family Doctor vouches verbally over the phone and gives you signed paperwork of your condition and how they want other Doctors to treat you if you have to go to the hospital for too much pain, some Doctors will refuse to treat you because they think you might be an addict. The will also block you from getting a second opinion at that hospital unless you are willing to wait an extra 12 hours (after you have already waited 18 hours) for the next shift of Doctors to come on to give their second opinion.

Just to let you know, asshole drug addicts or cunt prescription sellers are clogging up the system with their illegitimate painkiller claims. They are the reason why people with legitimate pain are suffering and having to jump through multiple legal hoops and are forced to be closely monitored on their usage of pain medication you need to survive each day.

So yeah, incels please tell me how much YOUR life sucks because people won't sleep with you because you are too ugly. It's not like the reason you are undateable is because you: don't have a job, lack proper hygiene, or refuse to improve yourself in any way, shape, or form in order to become attractive to the female gender.

How about you whiny, little cunts stop feeling sorry for yourself and be glad you don't have debilitating injuries or physical conditions! Or why don't you be fucking thankful that you are for the most part healthy and able to change your way of living if you want! 

People who think that hurting or killing others is justifiable because they are ""suffering"" are nothing more than scum that deserve to never have sex or reproduce! SEX IS NOT A RIGHT, IT IS A GIFT THAT TWO PEOPLE GIVE TO EACH OTHER TO FEEL LOVED BY THE OTHER!",1,0,2018-09-17T14:04:05.000Z

"I think there's something worth clarifying, here... The term ""incel"" refers to a condition, not an ideology. The condition, when combined with other conditions, can certainly foster a toxic ideology that might not otherwise be able to fester, but it's not the toxic ideology itself.
Now, these incels in particular do sound pretty awful for the most part, and much of the criticism I see of them seems deserved. Not all of it, but most of it. One comment saying that every incel is basically a piece of literal shit went a bit too far, in my opinion, but other than the broad-brushing stuff like that, yeah, it's pretty applicable. That said, I'm curious how many people would say anything similar of a woman, were she to adopt a similar mindset to these incel men. Perhaps it's because of limited exposure on my part, but my prediction is that most of those here would make excuses for such a woman.
With that out of the way, I'd actually like to open this up to discussion. Perhaps my prediction will be proven wrong. So, here's the question I'd like to pose, to any who have read this far and wish to comment: Do you believe that this ideology is wrong under any identity, or does a different identity for the subject change the alignment in your eyes? I hope to have a worthwhile discussion here. Perhaps I'll learn something new.
In case it doesn't translate, though, my prediction is not meant to be accusatory to anyone in particular. I'm not here to tell you you're evil, or anything, but I have a strong dislike for double-standards, and I've seen a lot coming from the left. That said, I realize there's a possibility that those could just be a vocal minority, not the majority. The point I'm trying to make is that I'm here in the spirit of honesty, not in the spirit of war. And now, I post this, awaiting answers.",0,1,2018-09-03T00:42:55.000Z

"An incel is any guy who hits on you who you don't find attractive based on most women's description. Because, clearly, if a man is unattractive he is dangerous and psychotic and will club you in the head and drag you into his musky, anime pillow-filled sex dungeon to rape and then kill you if you turn down his advances.

I love how ""woke"" millennial women are so biased and paranoid about people based on their physical appearance. The idea of these dweeby ""school shooter type"" that just doesn't exist. Know how I know? Because the Columbine shooter from over 2 decades ago is still most people's go-to example. 


I know some of these incels are legitimate creeps. Like the ones whose comments were read here. But how many people actually identify as an incel? I've never met one outside the internet. It's an incredibly niche phenomenon that's been  sensationalized by bullies who want to extend it to any (usually white) guy they find unattractive.

Incels are not a problem because you will probably never even meet one in real life. But, hey,  I have a dissenting opinion so I'm probably just a butthurt incel myself. That'll sure silence me!",1,3,2018-09-02T03:16:02.000Z

"I'm not saying this to detract from your video, more as something to say to people who haven't considered the idea.
I think it's important to realize that a lot of these people saying things like this are just venting. For example, I exaggerate my negative feelings and talk about killing myself on Instagram all the time, and I have a lot of followers who do the same thing to varying degrees. We aren't some kind of volatile suicidal autistic maniacs, we just vent to get things off our chests and it'll often be that the things we say are something we'd look back on when we're in a more stable mindset and think those things were ridiculous and hyperbolic. 
I think this is just important to consider.

Women were not even part of the plan. I achieved my goal and I met my wife along the way.  Here is my caveat: There were some cute girls in High School and college that  I probably could have dated.

Hello qt 3.14,0,0,2018-08-23T10:31:34.000Z
"Ugh these people sound like they've been listening to too much Jordan Peterson and Red Pill PUA weirdos. I do feel bad for them on one level, because I have also grown up in the post 2008 neoliberal economic hellscape that we have found ourselves in. I understand that it is demoralizing to be unable to find decent employment, affordable housing, a way to get out f student loan debt when there aren't jobs in your field, etc.-- especially in the world of capitalism where you're told that you have tons of opportunities and that if you work hard you should be succeeding (because it's poor people's fault that they're poor). It can really crush your self esteem if you buy into capitalist ideology and the cultural myth of meritocracy and upward mobility, and you work your ass off but still don't see any improvement in your life. And I know that loneliness and depression very much can distort your perception of the world. But these people respond with such hatred and misanthropy... It's incredibly toxic. There are so many people who deal with depression and disappointment and other struggles and mental health issues without becoming vile resentful misogynistic nihilists. Still, I know that people don't choose who their parents are, their DNA, what circumstances they're born into... I do still feel bad for them. But it doesn't justify becoming anti-human and making not being able to have sex the center of your identity. Aeons is right-- the best thing you can do is focus on self-development. Pursue a hobby, start practicing something you can get better at, teach yourself, take care of your life, and learn to relate to people healthily-- actually try to be empathetic towards people who are different from you (whether that's women or minorities or people of different political views-- whoever). Strive to be someone you can actually be proud of... Those are the things that will actually enable you to find love or sex or whatever you need. Not doubling down on how hopeless and pathetic you are. It's not the fact that you're a virgin that's lame and embarassing and unattractive... It's becoming someone who hates and pitied themselves enough to embrace the darkness. Once you learn that you can be halfway there, but that really is the first step. There are communities and affinity groups for pretty much every subject you can imagine, so just really ask yourself if they're really the ones you want to associate with and create your identity around. 

And then these right-wing ""intellectuals"" come in and appeal to these people, and essentially exploit their hate and hopelessness to lure them into ideologies that give them even more scapegoats to blame for their situation. And the saddest thing is that these few successful academics, YouTubers, and other influencers who espouse and defend this kind of ideology take advantage of all those people who, whatever you think of them are clearly struggling in life, and in doing so they convince them that this lifestyle really is a way forward. They teach them that their feelings of resentment towards women are justified. They teach them that anyone who criticizes misogyny or homophobia or racism is part of some enemy conspiracy (""cultural Marxists"" or ""SJWs"" or whatever else) who want to finish the job or destroying Western civilization. They teach them that the problem is social progress, and in doing so, because of the association with capitalism or the right-wing influencers supporting that community, these incels end up defending the very system that is the true cause of most of their problems. We have an economic system that doesn't guarantee jobs, or basic needs, or free college, or the opportunity for average workers to play a role in running the institutions where they spend most of their waking hours, but when the incel finds himself alone, in debt, unemployed, depressed, alienated, unfulfilled... They look for answers about why that is, and they are told ""It's the left-- it's socialism, communism, anarchists, antifa, feminists, Black Lives Matter-- the left are all postmodernists (not true) and 'cultural Marxists' (a conspiracy theory literally started by the Nazis), and their ideas are all literally intended to destroy the multitude of opportunities that you have in this free market!"" I think this narrative is a pretty rational outcome of neoliberalism. There's a whole generation growing up who capitalism has FAILED 100%. They have been left behind by history and sold platitudes about how lucky they are. The ONLY way to convince someone that a system which is failing them is the best of all possible systems is to demonize all other possible systems to the point where they're unthinkable and to appeal to them in terms of other issues. 

So they tell them that they understand why they are struggling and they sympathize with them about all those feminists who they despise, or the decline of our culture... But I would argue that the biggest reason the ruling class bothers to appeal to those people is largely to win them over to the side of the ruling class in the struggle. They don't want them siding with the left and attempting to actually create a better system-- they want them defending their oppressors. I would love it if these people started helping themselves and recognized that they could have a place in society, but to do that they would HAVE to get over their problem with women-- not the problem of not getting laid, but the problem that they resent or hate them. That and the general misanthropic nihilist thing.",2,5,2018-08-23T07:31:40.000Z

"Full disclosure:  I'm an introvert, prone to anxiety attacks, and I look roughly like Mickey Rooney's character in Breakfast at Tiffany's crossed with an overripe pumpkin.  So in a way, I empathize with a lot of the angst surrounding incel culture.  For those of us who don't necessarily fit the conventional expectations of how a dateable man should be, getting into a relationship seem like an insurmountable challenge.  We live in a mostly visual culture and thus we form first impressions mostly through visual cues.  So, frustration?  Yeah, I've been there, I'm still there, etc. etc.

But like most other commenters have pointed out, genuine attraction goes beyond the physical.  I have met devastatingly gorgeous women only to shrivel away in disgust once they open their mouths.  I have also met women who, according to incelese, would be a ""sub-5,"" but once I interacted with them, suddenly they just... glow.  Once I know their inner selves, everything about them becomes beautiful.  And from all the loving relationships I observe around me, I surmise that this is more or less universal, that regular people are capable of looking beyond the superficial.  All I need to do is expand my horizon and grow as a person and, with some luck, I will meet someone with whom I share a mutual attraction.  Even if this were not the case, even if I were to be single for the rest of my life... I'd be disappointed, but you know what, it's still all good.  I would have had the satisfaction of living a full life, and that's okay.

Unfortunately, incels have allowed their bitterness to prevent them from seeing this, and worse of all, to color their interactions with people, especially women.  And generally speaking, bitterness isn't an attractive trait.",7,1,2018-08-23T02:43:00.000Z

"Being a virgin in your twenties is entirely a normal thing and no reason to lose hope you might do the sex one day. The truth is it really doesn't matter, and pegging one's self worth to something superficial like that is a recipe for hating yourself. If you hate yourself no one will ever romantically love you in a way that will make your life any better, plain and simple. I don't mean intrusive thoughts of being a failure, or sometimes believing yourself unlovable. I mean consciously giving up on ever loving yourself. It's because loving yourself isn't easy, but it is easier than loving another person. This is the reason you see incels directing so much hate at women, it seems especially ones they are attracted to. This is why they hate people they think are ""better"" or ""more successful"" than themselves. It's not their faces, or their bodies, or their nerdy hobbies, or even most of what makes up their personalities that make them so unattractive and easy targets for hate. The reason is they aren't strong or determined enough to love themselves no matter what, they are weak enough to not even try, and this means they are incapable of loving anyone else.",0,0,2018-08-22T19:31:25.000Z

"I've known several Mormon women in my life, even dated one.  A very weird experience I must say.

Really if somebody is willing to convert to a very conservative and all-encompassing religion that they don't really believe in, requiring them to live a life of lip service and toxic dishonesty, all to get a girlfriend/wife/human being you can degrade to just a sexual and psychological object and then discard...clearly they are so damaged they should probably be institutionalized because they're obviously a complete sociopath.

"I feel like the one thing that you mentioned in your video is a very important aspect of dealing with men that incels never think about, but they ironically tend to reference all the time. Sometimes it's not women being picky, it's women being CAREFUL. I'm not saying that every interaction with a man registers as ""DANGER WILL ROBINSON"" to women, but we are so conditioned from a young age to notice red flags and danger signs of ""if this interaction goes wrong, I might be in danger"". Interacting with men, for women, can literally be lethal. It's the reason why she mentioned in the beginning of her video that she gave a guy a fake number. It's not, ""ew gross"" it's self preservation. I read a post on this video about how ""even if you're ugly if you're young/virgin/notfat then men will be desperate to fuck you"" -> and that's the problem. Desperation can be dangerous for women. You'd think with as many guys on incel boards posting about how much they want to murder, hurt, rape, etc women, that this would register for them. Even if they aren't the ones posting it, or agreeing with it you'd think seeing it would maybe trigger the ""Hey, maybe the reason why women won't talk to me is because they're afraid I'm that guy, or that kind of person. Maybe this is not a me issue, it's a culture issue"". - It's not that we want you to be that kind of person (who would??), it's not even that we ASSUME that you are. It is simply a proactive step. That's something that we have to always be aware of, not as a constant forward thought, but it's always in the back of our minds, one way or another. 
Maybe you're socially awkward, or just made a social misstep (we all do it) in a conversation and it gives a girl a bad vibe and something like the above happens to you, even if you'd never even image hurting a woman in your life. We have literally no way of knowing that, and it's foolish in any respect to take anyone you don't know at their word. 

And it's an unfortunate fact of life that people tend to put more subconscious trust in more attractive people. I think I read an article about it once. Maybe it's bogus? but it's important to note that, attractive men hurt women, attractive women hurt men. Attractive people can hurt anyone just as much as as anyone else. They are not above the malicious or sociopathic. Look at Ted Bundy. He was considered an attractive man, a charismatic guy, a good fellow. He was desired by women. Women trusted him. And they paid the highest price for it. That's why, sometimes, even if a guy is super ""hot"" to us, we have to be careful. I honestly think a lot of these issues are about culture. Nothing is black and white. There are many reasons why people, women, do the things they do. It isn't all inherently malicious. 

And I'm not trying to say women are terrified all the time. And I'm not saying some women aren't just jerks. Because they exist. I'm just saying, I wish it was something that people thought more about I guess. Incels might think women hold all the sexual power, in being able to be ""picky bitches"" but they forget that on average most guys could probably overpower a woman easily, especially if taken by surprise. I'm pretty strong, I've spent a lot of my life lifting hay bales and 50lb feed bags, but I still wouldn't want to take my chances with most guys, and I don't know anyone that would want to take that 50/50 chance between ""I can beat this guy if he jumps me"" or ""If he jumps me I could die.""

"I mean why do these guys seem to think it‚Äôs their looks. I mean personally I find ugly/unconventionally attractive guys with eye bags and all that much hotter than any jacked up dude with abs or a chiseled face. I mean I think Murray from Furbabayfur is the epitome of male perfection. You know why, cause even though he isn‚Äôt attractive or at least conventionally so (even if that‚Äôs the opposite for me) he has amazing charisma and is very talented. He doesn‚Äôt need to be ‚ÄúChad‚Äù because he‚Äôs attractive in other ways that aren‚Äôt purely physical. If you think you need to be hot to get girls, while I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt help I‚Äôm sure, you‚Äôre still very able to find women.
I knew a guy actually who looked like Steve Erkel and had a lazy eye that pointed the other way and you know what, women swooned over him all the time. One girl ate paper because he just made a joke about how he liked to eat paper. Even after elementary the dude never looked like he had trouble. You know why? Once again, he was charismatic, a good person, and he was very interesting. 
I know a guy personally who looks like a frog version of Kurt Cobain who spends his time smoking pot and going on Reddit. He got together with one of the hottest girls I‚Äôve ever met. Why? Because I must keep reiterating that he is very charismatic and mostly a good person. He‚Äôs good at art and writing but I didn‚Äôt even know until very recently when he really started doing it and showing others, so I don‚Äôt even think talent was a factor!
Both of these people are shining example that looks don‚Äôt always equal women, or at least good ones. You can get with people I promise you, you just have to make yourself attractive in other ways. You have to work on charm most of all, it‚Äôs the most common thing I see connecting relationships with people who aren‚Äôt very attractive. You need to be nice but that isn‚Äôt it, you need to be interesting, fun, people who someone else wants to be around. 
Most of all though, it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt find love right now or even in the next twenty years. People are all different, sometimes that person isn‚Äôt around right now. My aunt was forty till she got married. Sometimes it‚Äôs all about waiting and improving your life at the moment. I‚Äôm a romantic so it‚Äôs hard feelings for me to say this but  romantic love isn‚Äôt the most important thing and you don‚Äôt need it. It‚Äôs going to be okay.",8,6,2018-08-16T01:43:43.000Z

"I think that that incels vary depending on why they are incels. Some are angry about constant rejection, others are pathetic who don't try hard enough, some are very sad people who have not had the best of life, and then there are incels who are creepy overly sexual guys.
I really believe that some of them have been mistreated and gotten something they didn't deserve, while the other half belongs in a mental hospital. I myself have been a virgin for several years, all of my life most girls have despised me (note I've never asked out a girl before), but I had to realise, I have to keep moving. incels would probably tell me I should join them, but I don't want to. For me to become an incel would be to accept defeat. If I die a virgin then so be it. There's nothing I can do, and that's what makes me different from them.

"I don‚Äôt think men realise dating and relationships are complex and you don‚Äôt have to have a reason to say no when they ask you out. You really don‚Äôt. 
You also don‚Äôt need a reason to not be attracted to someone. You don‚Äôt need to explain yourself. Sure, don‚Äôt be rude about rejection (unless they won‚Äôt stop after the first no) but you don‚Äôt owe them with a full on essay about why. No is a full sentence and should be respected as such. 
Also: it‚Äôs 100% to not go out with someone because you aren‚Äôt physically attracted to them. Physical attraction does not equal beauty either. There are people that are objectively hot but you aren‚Äôt attracted to them as well as there are people who are objectively not hot and yet they are attractive. Being attractive means charisma and such too. 
These people really think women owe them with a date if they spew a few ‚Äúcompliments‚Äù or whatever.
And *then* they proceed to get mad at women when they say no. And *then* they are all suicidal and depressed because someone kindly rejected them and they go on incel to talk about how ‚Äúthe world is rotting‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen are all worthless animals‚Äù and ‚Äúwomen only want guys that are hot and rich and famous‚Äù.

Being honest here, if you're good-looking the chances of you getting fucked are higher. But being in a relationship is another level. You don't date just because of the looks, maybe if you're famous but not the average person, your personality is a major role in all of that. And seeing this? The reason they don't have a girlfriend is because they're creepy and scare the majority of women they meet. Personally, I don't think virginity should be treated the way it does.

"There is a huge misconception. They don't actually hate women, they actually hate succesful and attractive men that women crave. I suppose that this people has a serious mental illness (no joke)..
And interestingly you (western women) are consciously or unconsciously attracted to them.

¬†Western women are simplier to become an incel, because women in western countries essentially need three things to survive: shoes, handbags and attention. Water, food and air are secondary requirements.

Attention, I would say, is the most critical requirement. Simply put, if a woman does not get attention, she dies. No, seriously, she does. If you don't give them 'attention' they will hate you (especially to guys who they were attracted to), and later will become an incel. Also, the core of incels came actually from western women, rather first incels were western women. Incels and feminists are the same filthiness..

"The reality is, men and women live in two completely different realities. Life is going to be the easiest for a woman early on and more difficult for a man early on as young women are the most valued human on the planet and young men being the least. With all due respect, a woman in this females age bracket cannot give any accurate reading of life and the issues within it. I would love to see this girl sit with an older woman (40+) and speak on this to prove my point. The incels do have some logic, but they went either a bit extreme to overly extreme. I hope if they make it to 30 (when the dating game completely flips and the same women who wouldn't look in your direction will go out of their way to contact you) and see what the game was the whole time, they can gain some type of peace. But life just sucks if you're a young man (13- 25/30). You have nothing of value to others in your age bracket (maybe to some older woman who has a fetish for a younger guy) and are completely disposable. Women are born into having something others want (a vagina and/or beauty), so listening to any woman on ""reality"" before they turn at least 30-35 (when they ""fall-off"" and actually have to do some real thinking in life) is like listening to a 9 year old on how you should drive on the highway.

"I see these young men as being the extreme result of the cultural attitude of young boys who place a lot into women's opinion of them. These guys feel invalidated by this because they think they are socially worthless without women. This turns into a frustration with those they are expected to cater to, in a sense, and I'd say there are some cultural aspects which place more pressure on boys to cater to girls (though that may just come down to perspective). Regardless, this attitude isn't abnormal or unheard of: the whole idea of a ""player"" is more based on how much harder it tends to be for guys to get girls on average. I don't know if it's more that girls tend to be more high maintenance or if girls simply don't often see sex as being as important to the other parts of a relationship (on average, of course), but I'm more inclined to believe the latter as a result of a hormonal difference. For the guys who cannot fulfill this, it can be pretty damaging (as for any who are rejected), but with incels specifically, they are often abused in other ways and/or simply place a higher importance or focus on seeking validation by women, which can include sex (though that isn't the only thing). I still empathize with them because even though I don't really feel that way about people to that degree, I know what it's like to be stuck in an echo chamber and to feel worthless and suicidal. 

I feel if there was more of a focus on education to talk about establishing healthy relationships, this would be less likely to occur (not everyone goes to school), but it would have to be done equitably. There's a narrative going around about basically telling boys not to rape, but this is so incredibly manipulative and loaded to do this, as most men do not rape nor often intend to make their partners feel uncomfortable. VAWA (Violence Against Women Act) has something to do with this based on analyzing the language in it, so I would hope that relationship advice is done more like how my school did it (seeing men and women as equal partners capable of good or bad acts).",0,0,2018-08-08T03:36:42.000Z

 Its crazy to see how they use the name ""chad"" to describe these super good looking guys who seem to get any women they want. That is a fantasy.

"Tips to get a lady:

Learn to realize when you should be empathetic to others. Look up socialization ques so you can know if you are off putting to women when approaching them. 

Become more self aware of your feelings and negative things you are telling yourself. If necessary use cognitive behavioral therapy on yourself by editing negative & prejudice thoughts you have that are reinforcing the stigma you feel from being an incel. 

Be healthy. Workout. Eat well. Start a skin care routine, even its its a cleanser for your skin type and a good moisterizer. You will feel physically and mentally better. its a great start to begin overal happiness and a very admirable trait to mention while trying to date. Dont spam it though . Its important to have more to your personality then just looking good. 

Keep yourself up. Do things stylewise that are just for you and really showcase your personality. Grow facial hair. Get a cool hair style that fits your persona but doesnt look dirty or unkempt. 

You dont have to spend tons of cash/have name brand clothes But at least try to have well fitting clothes that compliment you body shape. This aids in your overall attractiveness by being aesthetically pleasing. 

Learn what interests you have whether it be video games, art, music traveling, seeing live stand up comedy or being a movie fanatic. Use this hobby to join online communities that share similar interests with you. This will hell you gain friends and can become a talking point when chatting with girls online. 

Try making friends with women. This could also give you insight on why women arent choosing you as mates. 

Remember Not every contact with a girl has to be sex related. My husband and i consider each other best friends and sexual intimacy is a great bonus.  

Most importantly learn to love yourself. And not in the ""i dont see anything wrong with me wtf is wrong with these hoes today"" kinda way but in the ""i am perfectly imperfect and i am okay with that. There maybe women who aren't interested in me but that doesn't decrease my value as a human being""  

Lastly when you do get with a woman sexually PLEASE learn as much as you can about our bodies and dont come into the bedroom thinking she needs to be begging you to bang her and squirting at the mire thought of you being inside of her. Taking thinks slow, making it an intimate moment for both of you and tons of communication, fourplay, lube, good digital, oral and thoughtful stroking skills are essential to a great experience for both parties. And increase the likelihood of her coming back for more. I would suggests informative porn from actual sex therapist and switching to homemade amature porn of devoted couples as well. (Ideally with participants that look like you so you can really visualize yourself properly) that way you can get a more realistic idea of how sex between lovers should go.  

Honestly hopes this helps in contrast just calling you names and laughing at your misfortune. 

P.S. plz give me feed back on if you agree with the points I made. Thanks Friends",1,1,2018-08-06T05:43:31.000Z
"tbqh, Ontario, Canada is a shithole for men, no offense, I live across the lake in Ohio. now I admit, I have an account there, the problem is these men want relationships, not just sex. women see them as one and the same and fail to differentiate between two, therefore tagging men who don't fit their laundry list of standards (which is minimal in men's cases) as creepy. women also value relationships less than men, which at a point I can understand why they have such high standards, because they can get in one easier than a man, a sort of gatekeeper to the soul. unfortunately, due to women outnumbering men, the stats shows there are lesbians, women who feel not the need to have children or are ""happily single"" or feminists. they are a drain on social resources since they will not pair up. not to be an asshole but we could lose a third of that slack so that for every man a woman. this triggers the ""liberal-style"" marxists by flipping the idea of ""of each accord to their ability to each according to their need"" by using the sexual marketplace instead of pre-existing social services.",0,0,2018-08-06T05:38:48.000Z

"I have just found out about this incel thing and unfortunately groups like this are fuelled by the internet, without it, I think it would be unlikely for a group like this to form at your local community centre.  This is one of the bad things about the internet from alt right to neo Nazis and other homophobic, misogynistic hate groups. The internet provides the platform to organize any political ideology and spread disinformation. 
I have been a single man for a little over a year and a half now and if you are a heterosexual man I understand the desire to feel loved by a woman. I describe it as a dull ache, however we do possess a brain and we should use it to improve our emotional status and view of life. I have excepted that I will probably be alone for the rest of my life which could be a long time, so putting it as simply as I can, I am making the best of it. We actually do have a choice on whether to be happy or not, circumstances be damned. 
A word of warning to the pretty gay lady, I come from the male side of the fence I know how fucked up these guys are.

"I'm 22, single and a virgin but I'd never consider myself to be an incel.  Their ideology is so overwhelmingly negative that I just can't bring myself to agree with many of their toxic and unhelpful beliefs.  My biggest gripe with the Incel community is the impact their more extreme views might have on younger, more impressionable boys/men who aren't finding much success in the dating world; it's just unhealthy and promotes the idea of giving up simply because they might be self conscious about their appearance or their general appeal to people they'd like to date, or encouraging hatred against girls and women simply because they've had a few bad personal experiences.  I do sympathise with incels to a degree as I know it's very difficult to be single for a lot of people, including myself at many times, and I'm aware that not EVERY incel shares these ideas, but if incels make no effort to improve their attitude and refuse to give themselves a chance, then how can they expect things to improve for themselves?!  Being single doesn't have to be bleak and depressing, I've spent my single days trying to build my character and learning how to express myself better and I'm noticing a difference already as I'm feeling more confident and more comfortable on the dating scene!  I'd encourage any incels to try and do the same, even if it seems difficult at first (it was for me at least) because a good, positive attitude and outlook adds waaay more attractiveness than physical qualities ever could ! :)  Alas, i'm just a dude with an opinion (a ranty one, evidently).

After a year, women started approaching me and I purposefully gave them the same rejections I received in the past. This may have satisfied the pain in me but it wasn't too long until I realized that I am not a bad person and should not continue to do this.

The forum you are reading has mostly ranting from vanilla frustrated young men. The only comments that struck me as really ""incel"" was the creepiest one about why should we congratulate women who are pregnant and also that one about the guy who switched off the light in the public toilet. The connection is an unhealthy obsession with biology. Especially ideological incels go on about genes and how they have inherited then wrong ones. The incel ""in-group"" considers that they have poor genes and women are merely shallowly picking mates from the ""out group"" of ""chads"" who supposedly have superior genes. This is what connects incel culture with racism and fascism, which similarly misconstrues biology but in the opposite sense so the in-group is supposed to have superior genes to the outgroup.",0,0,2018-07-25T22:29:08.000Z

"Such rude behavior from both men and women(i use these terms loosely as people have forgotten their manners). Respect is not bestowed but earned. Beautiful is created and then surrounds  you in it's beauty.  Orchids can take many years to bloom but are still collected due to what they provide. Bees provide the best food on earth. Honey. Love is an emotion you feel for other people not yourself.Tthat warm, fuzzy, feeling CREATED by someone you care about when they come into the same room, that is love or at the very least fondness. Self love does not exist-Do people wake up and hug themselves? Uhh no. Want to change the world? Create beautiful or exist in self-deprication of selfishness. Choice it would seem is dependent upon personal preference not social construct. Monetary gain is a nice thing to accomplish but many things are worthwhile that do not exist to merely placate the self-righteous, insatiable, wannabe that exists on others back patting. No reward is greater than personal achievement not acceptance of that created beauty. Create beautiful or knock as a beggar at the doorstep that is without. It all boils down to-Create beautiful with effort or suffer in wanting that never secedes an escape from it. Such livation of experience cannot be given but must be ACHIEVED. Joy is an aceivement not a GIFT. When such beauty is proffered and then rejected it is unwise to proffer such beauty yet again to the disdainful.

"you should feel bad just for thinking that every uncomfortable encounter you have means that your in life threatening danger. My guess is that if someone is going to harm you, a phone number isnt going to change that.

I will say that there are plenty of people that are ""incels"" (god im already hating that term), that are immature or immoral to a point that caused the fact that they cant get laid in the first place. But its not a phenomena thats only happening to ""creepy losers"" or w/e you want to call them. But if I were to paint the entire group of feminism by the craziest shit ive read about them on the internet, it wouldnt be too flattering either.

Instead of looking at incels like a pest that needs to be exterminated, we should be looking at them as sick people or people who otherwise need help, and as a symptom of malaise in our culture.

5:10 should respect them just because they are a person having a hard time, or maybe just respect the kid thats in them.
5:37 no shit I would argue its actually just about as traumatic, at least for the ones who really care about someone and cant find that love from someone else for themselves. Hell, it could be more traumatic depending on circumstances. Your pretty, and a girl. I doubt you really get what its like that NO ONE would ever want to touch you.

"Incels are fucking retarded,  because some statistics say that there more women then men, and there are a waping 7 billion people on this planet, so if a women says no just respect her choice and try to find another one. 

and if you do the maths, then chances are you will find someone who is hotter then the women who rejected you, and who does want to be with you. So to get hung up on one women is stupid, yeah It might be hard, and as long as the women is respectful about but you have to lean to deal with it. 

And another point is you have to learn, first of all, not to put women on a pedestal which a lot of those incel retards do, and you should also find a female version of you that is a the mistake a lot of those retards make because they go after ones who are not.

Furthermore the acroniem involitabeal cebalcy is a load of crap. It does not existent, because those retards assume that sex or a relationship is something that women ow men, no it does not.

"Idk why I always see all these comments saying that women who are virgins still have it somewhat easier than men. Honestly, finding someone who is interested you/wants to have sex with you has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with personality. I‚Äôm a 21 year old virgin and I know that I could not just go up and proposition a man to have sex with me and he would say yes. All these incels claiming that he would are delusional. People are selective and that‚Äôs that. It‚Äôs also degrading to other men to imply that they are so desperate for sex that they‚Äôll never turn down a women who asks them. And I can admit that the reason I‚Äôm a virgin is because of my own personal issues with illness, depression, social anxiety, ptsd and etc. that has cut a lot of relationships I‚Äôve had short because I‚Äôd basically have to leave and go to the hospital for a while and when I came back I had to start from scratch getting to know people because each time, I was starting a new part of my life (high school, college, etc) so i had to meet people all over again. i‚Äôve had people who have found me attractive or had crushes on me but it just never went anywhere because of my own personal factors and the fact that i tend to isolate myself from people a lot. i get discouraged a lot, i do. but constantly blaming other people for your problems instead of being self aware and trying to fix them is not going to get you anywhere. there are plenty of female virgins who are perfectly attractive but just haven‚Äôt had sex yet, just because it hasn‚Äôt happened yet and everyone‚Äôs luck with meeting people is different. generalizing people and their experiences is just going to make you more miserable especially if you realize not everyone fits the box you‚Äôre trying to put them in",2,5,2018-07-23T04:38:31.000Z

"The single most common trait among these fellows is narcissism.  narcissism is NOT self love, it is self obsession.  I have known and or met a few women who talk the same way about people and themselves and other people. They to look at people in the world and assume those people are all happy, unlike themselves. They are unhappy and certain that someone else is responsible for their misery.

These guys are miserable as hell and have trouble getting their heads around the obvious fact that they are the authors of their own unhappy state. They do not take emotional risks, believing that rejection is almost certain and determining that they will not take that risk, as they sit socially frozen in the corner,  making their brutal judgements about others, assuming everyone else is happy happy.

Talk to one for five minutes and you immediately know why they have trouble meeting women. Self pity is unpleasant stuff and any woman who is thinking clearly, will recognize the emotional neediness and self pity factor.  Self pity is potentially dangerous stuff because those suffering from self pity really want you to hurt like they do and nothing they could do to you could possibly hurt as much as they hurt.  Male or female, makes no difference. The self piteous narcissistic is not something to play with, no matter what the person looks like, no matter what else they have going for them otherwise.

"I can feel myself sorta developing an incel mentality, but I feel like I shouldn't even be having this interpersonal conflict. I definitely don't hate pregnant women, and I don't go around hating women for not automatically wanting to have sex with me. But I do feel discouraged now that I'm a older and don't seem to see that many women attracted to me like when I was a young teenager and late teens. I'm not saying I was some stud, but I definitely had less difficulty dating and approaching women. It can be really frustrating.

I'm not the most attractive person but I'm certainly not the ugliest,  I have a good sense of humor or at least I used to, but after the passing of my sister (who was like a mentor to me) its been really hard for me to maintain any kind of self confidence, and I sort of let myself go off the deep end. I dated a girl who I really enjoyed being with and for a good duration of the relationship she enjoyed being with me, but my insecurities in regards to the way my face looks got the better of me, i have this habit where I compare myself to other men  who are more attractive than me and i tend to beat myself or put myself  down for not looking like those men and after putting her through so much stress I knew I didn't want to continue stressing her out and making her feel like what she was doing for me wasn't enough. I ended my relationship with her, I let her go.

 And things have sort of gotten tougher since. 

 It's been a few months since we broke up and I've sorta had a hard time meeting someone new. 

Although I'm not at the level of bitterness or angry as someone who calls themselves incel, I can feel myself getting there... I don't want to be in the situation because I feel like a lot of those people are miserable but I'm in a really shitty mindset now a days. 

I don't know why I typed all of this but this video sort of made me think all at once about a lot of stuff.",6,4,2018-07-17T06:39:00.000Z

"I feel that a large part of how the incel community formed is the over-exaggeration of how important love and romance is within our media. Romance movies treat love as a cure all for all problems a character may face when in reality relationships take hard work and even in the most rugged of action movies or the most ridiculous comedies a romantic subplot is expected as if people just fall into relationships while busy doing other things. This creates a false expectation of what love really is and how people experience it that when shattered in adulthood seems to really scar some people. Personally I'm glad that newer movies and shows like Crazy Ex-Girlfriend are starting to take a more mature and rounded look at love, challenging the false notions that have been set into our society.",10,4,2018-07-13T00:13:32.000Z

As someone who was briefly a part of the MGTOW movement I do empathize with these people somewhat despite finding their condoning of violence and general hatred toward others repulsive.

My whole life I've found the vast majority of people I've met to be shallow and generally incapable of thinking for themselves, instead just regurgitating what they've been trained to say or what they think you want to hear. I generally hate small talk but can hold a deep conversation with a stranger pretty easily. I've accepted that I'm the weird one and that most people are uncomfortable in that situation or incapable of operating in it. Luckily for me I've always been very ""live and let live"" about everything and I don't take things personally, so I've never held any resentment for these ""normies"" as some call them (I hate dehumanizing terms like that). Imo some of these incels are people who are like me in that they see people as shallow and uninteresting in general, but unlike me feel personally offended by society.

I think prostitutes would give them what they need in the short term, and in the long term they will see women as actual people with problems and flaws rather than objects with vaginas to be obsessed about.

When you get down to it, chess is a game, the more you play it, the better you will get at it. Intelligent people will have a better time with it, but this does not mean you have to be intelligent to be good at chess. Chess is a horrible hobby if you're using it to try and impress people cause at the end of the day you have a wooden board, 32 pieces, and two time clocks. Most likely the person you're trying to impress already knows what all of those look like, and your talking about chess doesn't add anything to their life hence why they won't be interested. You can get some nice decorative chess sets, but using that to hit on someone is akin to saying ""hey I have a really cool table, wanna come back to my place and see it?""

"Ive been studying and analysing the incels for a while, and I thought I would add in a few ideas, to how they can become happier within their lives. I wanted to add something different, rather than the old generic (Love yourself , someone for everyone ect). 

I think as humans have became more visual (everything from food to dating), looks have became more important than ever in dating. Thats not to say that obstacles cant be overcome, but I cant help feeling that there will always be a minority of men (whether it is 1% or 0.01%) who will miss out on romance in their lifetime. So the question is, what are the alternatives? How can these men cope and find fulfillment within themselves? In a male-virgin shaming society, I can appreciate why the incels would find it even harder to accept a life without romance, which is commonly seen/equated to as a fruitless life/terrible life/

As many people here would know, as an undateable 24 year old, I made a decision to give up on women and go my own way when I was 22 years old. I like to think I have done that pretty successfully (not that I dont get envious from time to time, because thats normal, everyone becomes envious at times), but as a whole, I think my self esteem, happiness and productivity increased tenfold since I vowed myself I would never try to date again. So heres the advice I came up with:

1- Stopped watching porn

I know most people watch porn and that is normally OK, but for us undateable guys (the only thing I have in common with the incels), it is very very unhealthy. Its basically just fantasy, baseless fantasy of pleasure that is never going to happen, which turns into an obsession which is not good. I stopped masterbating 3 years ago, and it did me wonders! 

2- Delete the dating apps

I found them to be unproductive and a waste of time, barely got any replies, I spent about 1 hour on them a day. After I deleted tinder/pof/OKCUIPD , I freed up more time to read about politics/play chess ect. Much more productive than getting rejected with no replies and feeling crap at the end of the hour you would normally spend on a dating app

3- Stop approaching women/flirting/asking them out

Just stop. Promise yourself you will never approach a woman as a potential date . Ever. I did that and it has kept me sane and happy. Dont get me wrong, women make up half the population and you still need to learn how to interact with them and fucking respect them (which incels dont). But you dont need to be attractive to women to live a happy fruitful life

And thats my advice for any angry bitter incels reading this (I am sure lots of them come on here and try and argue with you lot, painting themselves to be the victim). As an undateable virgin myself, I know firsthand there is so much more to life than dating and sex. Such as reading, walking, travelling, studying, playing sports ect.

Now this is not to say, that if you are an incel, you 100% will remain a virgin and dateless. Im sure some or most of them can get into relationships, but I just feel that as a society, we dont give young insecure men alternatives, which are different to the norm. Its like we almost threaten them with ""FIND ROMANCE OR HAVE A CRAPPY LIFE"" without actually saying it. So I thought I would come up with something different to what a normal physcologist or a friend would recommend, and see how it goes

Good luck to everyone",1,9,2018-07-06T23:10:38.000Z

They throw the damning words ""cope"" and ""low IQ"" at everything that even remotely sounds like philosophy, acceptance, or self-improvement.  The mods ban everything that conflicts with their views, and yet they don't--they seem to pick and choose based on reputation.  They have but one topic board and no ways for them to connect as a community other than their self-assigned label of celibacy.  I can only draw one conclusion, and that is that they go there to effectively die.  To wallow in in the mud, seeking kinship in the wrong place.  Jesus Christ how horrifying.

"I clicked on this video because I thought I would get some interesting in depth commentary on the phenomenon that is ""INCEL"".  

Disappointing, her commentary consisted of berating that community for it's inappropriate chastising of the world in general.  Basically, we have one group of people (INCEL's) that points its fingers at women, claiming they are the cause of their miserable lives, and a women pointing back making fun of these individuals.  

Before the age of the Internet virgin men would have to ""man up"" and go out and climb that mountain, if you know what I mean.  These days they just sit around in front of their computers commiserating online with other virgin males.  

Pathetic.  

But at the same time these ""INCEL's"" are chastised and denigrated by other online communities.  

We regrettably live in isolated and tortured times.   The Internet appears to have helped create a breakdown in social structure and community integration.  Individuals just group off and associate only with their ""own kind"".

I wish these young men could find a way to integrate and communicate with females, all of that mystery would disappear and they wouldn't feel so insecure when in the presence of the opposite sex.  

The difference between men and women is substantially less than what an INCEL may believe. Once you enter-act with females you will find that they are neither mysterious nor special, and that's a good thing.  They are just females, the opposite sex, nothing more and nothing less.  A male has nothing to fear, he should get over his own angst and treat her with respect‚Ä¶ like a decent human should.",8,1,2018-06-25T20:49:28.000Z

Although, these men need to realize that women are also in their situation. A lot of women want to be in relationships too. I think that stems back to monogamous culture in general, that people need to be in a relationship with one person their whole life to have fulfillment. But to be honest, that's just not true. You don't need to have sex or be in a relationship to be satisfied with life.

"Most incels are too shy to even talk to a woman let alone ask her for her number

There are many guys out there who are jerks that harass women but don't confuse those guys with the guys that are involuntarily celibate because they have autism or some other mental disability that prevents them from being able to have any intimate conversations

Most of us who are on the Spectrum just live out our lives sad and lonely and we don't even try 2 have intimacy because we don't understand the skill set needed 2 have a relationship of any kind

As a whole we get taken advantage of much more often then a normal guy would

There is the reverse of us which is the guy that never pays always treats the woman like crap is abusive physically emotionally and mentally

We see this type of guy often and we don't understand the interpersonal Dynamics which allow a woman to tolerate and to love a guy who beats them everyday and takes advantage of them everyday but they would not even try to have a relationship with someone like us that does not have social skills

I don't understand it and I would say most guys that are like me don't understand why women go with these horrible men time after time and we see it and we just get frustrated because women give them so easily what we try so hard to get and never get

I think the lack of empathy the lack of compassion the lack of being couth and having manners that seems to be widespread among Millennials and even people in their 40s and 50s and that's bad for society

If we had a more adults mature way of dealing with the world and each other then we would address the problem of involuntarily celibate men either through legalizing prostitution or through Sex Therapy which is available but only in a few States and it is very expensive

People constantly equate sex therapist with prostitutes and they are not at all similar

If we really cared about each other as a race we would make sure that by age 25 that everyone had been evaluated psychologically and each problem addressed at no cost to the person Health Care should be a human right that is free for all

Mental Health Care is desperately needed not just for involuntarily celibate people but for the human race as a whole

In America they say one out of four people are severely mentally ill and when it comes to CEOs nine out of 10 of them from the survey I saw it said nine out of 10 had severe problems like aggressive personality disorder anger management disorder and one out of three of them were real life sociopaths

It just goes to show that mental illness does not discriminate based on income",17,6,2018-06-11T21:01:40.000Z

I'm not an incel, but did you ever consider that some, especially during teens & early 20's, are allowed to be sexual, like drug dealers, etc., while other males who try flirting are deemed ""creepy?""
It's been scientifically proven: women send pornographic pictures of themselves to convicted murderers, rapists, etc. Sure, not all women are exactly like that, but most women are RELATED to that. What do you think '50 Shades Of Greed' is? 
The truth is is that women hate the different. Getting a body modification doesn't make you different. One aspect of this hatred is seeing debating as ""too nice"", ""creepy"", ""pathetic"", so, of course, there's going to be slander about such types by whores because they're finally getting exposed & women hate dealing with reality. 
It's a double standard: ""Let's just hate other men, but hating women for their immature sexuality & social incompetence is ""wrong.""""  People who blame other men for women's social incompetence & immature sexuality are infatuated, stupid, confused, frustrated, so they replace all of that to something easier.

"This new ‚Äúincel‚Äù thing is largely caused by radical third wave feminism. The twenty nothings are all born into a generation who‚Äôs males will majority die alone in their 70s. 

Their response to the neo Marxist world is to cry on the internet and base their whole self worth on how much or how little young narcissistic females like them. Rather than suicide they should focus on hobbies and work. Their lives would actually be worse if they were tied to the self important, petty, and arrogant females in their age group. What better way to get back at millennial women than to live a life of adventure and have a bigger bank account? The awesome thing is that they will majority die alone as well but will have nothing to show for it. 

I feel bad for millennial males. Progressive Society brainwashed them into thinking that shedding away or hiding all of their masculine traits is the best way into the hearts of women. It‚Äôs actually the highway to the forever friend zone. Men in my generation are generally doing just fine sexually but not so well with divorces or Marxist custody courts.

"Isn't it a bit insensitive to make a video of a sexy girl making fun of incels? I mean that is precisely why they become radicalized killers? Being humiliated by sexy girls. I know some people wanna say that is just ""oh, they are crazy evil people"". Or ""oh, its just misoginy"". But the fact is that if being humiliated by women can hurt even strong, confident and attractive guys, I can't even imagine what it does to these kids. Of course they have a million issues that cause their defeatism when they face this humiliation, but I think it would help if we didn't twist the knife. 

They clearly idolize women so much, incels are the ultimate manifestation of that song from Extreme, ""he man woman hater"". The chorus goes like this:
- Sooner or later, you'll be a he-man woman hater. Its inevitable. And to become one, you got to really hate to love them

That's the thing, if you idealize and idolize women so much, if you need their love and approval so much, then anything they do has an unimaginable power to hurt you. And also all your interpretations of the world become rigged and distorted by this bias. Its like a male version of how young girls can idealize older men, thinking they are ""complete"" beings somehow, that we know what we are doing, that our actions are simply the result of our will, as if we were Gods. They even have trouble understanding the fact that dicks aren't simply nuclear rockets that will fuck anything that moves... that some things turn us off, and we can't control what turns us off. And its the same for stacies: they think they have all they want, but the stacy figure is almost always tormented by the fact that she always loves what she can't have, just like incels. And as they for sure know, stacy reaches her apex value early so what they are seeing is the peak of stacy's existence when she is young. They are still too young to even know their ""sexual marketplace value"", since male value needs more time to be raised but takes more time to fade.

So this is my problem: everyone thinks incels hate women too much, but the real issue is that they love women too much; because they don't ""learn"" to hate women because someone told them to. It is their life who teaches them this. Its just like thinking feminists are produced by indoctrination when they are mostly produced by men mistreating them, and so on. 

Anyway, whatever. Cool video, nice appearance and voice

PS: About giving guys fake numbers, its ridiculous to complain. When you are in a situation with a stranger to whom you owe no satisfaction or anything, any ""white lie"" to get rid of him is fine. When we hook up with a girl that just simply doesn't go away on the next day after sleeping with you, we also need similar white lies to get rid of her.",2,3,2018-06-04T17:25:26.000Z

Of course, the flaw in this logic by the Incels is that it projects their mentality of desire onto everyone, and ignores how the 'love and validation' women get just for being female is also part of the oppressive pressure women face, just like the harshness men face is partly due to their greater strength and roughness as creatures - they are strong in those points, so the pressure against those points will tend to be stronger as well.",4,0,2018-06-04T01:22:29.000Z

"I want to make a comment about you catching my attention which weirded me out, had me thinking about it and now I feel like getting this off my chest, almost like some form of misguided blog post.
It's kinda simple to be honest you reminded me of a crush (it's not a strong enough word to describe it but calling it love makes me cringe) I had, took me a few minutes to realise though. I've been friends with her in a way as in talking about similar interests (mainly music and a few sprinkles of gaming) trying to help her with some personal struggles (since I'm not naming her or anything I probably can say it's trichotillomania) which I found out about by stalking like a f-ing creep.
Why am I writing this at 00:23 am having to get up early to my 8th workday in a row? Mainly because i haven't felt as lonely as lately in quite a long time (pack of sleep doesn't help) and I found it fitting to write something as silly as this on such a video. 
I broke up with my girlfriend of a year after struggling with the truth of not loving her feeling even lonlier around her and her getting more and more into although admittedly I should have ended it earlier... To be perfectly honest I didn't even manage that, she confronted me about being less and less talkative/interested in anything and I just kinda tiptoed around it until she had enough.
Just in case anyone is actually reading this I used to talk to my former crush about what I had on my mind which I don't want to anymore after telling her (7 years later) how I've felt all these years, I don't want to bother her with anything since she seams to have her life on track and all and there's no space for me to leech some attention.
Feels like I've overused the letter I in this. 
This is this famous point at which people usually reconsider actually sending what they have written.

"One has to wonder, did these individuals have any access when they were growing up to any strong, masculine, male role models? Did they never witness the complexities & dynamics of a real relationship?

It's tragic really. So much suffering & isolation has twisted & consumed them with such deep hatred of themselves & of others. 

I get that there are many issues, prejudices, & double standards within society, but, to let it fester like an infectious cancer & go this far!?

If there are any InCels reading this, I want to help you. I want to understand. 

All I can offer you is my humble advice. You can only be accountable for yourself & your behavior. As such you must take responsibility & accountability of yourself. 

Your identity & worth as a person is not define by by another's judgements & bias. They are defined by your mindfulness, (to yourself, as well as others) your honor, & your merit. 

Kill the boy within you that seeks comfort & validation from others, & be reborn, a man. 

Focus on building yourself & your empire. By this I mean, focus on improving you health & exercise.

 Improving your mind with meditation, contemplation, & knowledge. 

 Focus on your hobbies. 

 Set realistic life goals for yourself. Such as ways you can save, & gather your wealth. 

 Take steps to become less isolated. This does not mean you have to hang around other people. It could be as simple as a calm walk in a forest. 

 Fight the inner voice, or the, ""echo in the mirror"" as I have come to know it, when it degrades & cruelly critiques you. Never succumb to its petty lies. It is our inner demon, who id test our courage, & resolve, it will consume & destroy you, only if you allow it to. 

 Do not envy others for what they appear to have, that you do not. We all have our own personal trials & strife as we carve our destiny from fate's rule. No one's suffering is greater than another's. Only their limited perspective of the reality is, in which they exist within. 

I hope my advice finds comfort for those lost, & in need of light. 

Peace to all.",2,0,2018-05-26T11:04:59.000Z

This incel thing is weird. Getting laid is easy if you reduce your standards to 0 or have a 100$... Finding a woman you can share your life with that truly feels the same way about you. Now that is a 1-2x in a lifetime thing. I don't feel very handsome or attractive and I get sexually harassed by cougars almost daily. It wouldnt take much effort on my part to take one home but I just want something more meaningful so I dont. But then again Ive known what true love is. Maybe these kids just have no idea.,2,0,2018-05-25T01:54:37.000Z

Never hate a woman for not finding you sexually attractive. That is evil. 
How would you like it if people hated you, for you not finding them sexually attractive? Imagine if some crazy old man or women, hated you and started bullying you, just because you did not fancy them. 
I have been rejected by many, many women, but I do not hate any of those women for that. I am fat, and effeminate, so I understand women not being attracted to me. And yes it is humiliating, and embarassing, but that is not their fault. 
That is totally seperate from saying that people who fancy bullies for being bullies, are sick, evil and cowardly. 
But that is not an excuse to claim that any women who does want to go out with you is evil. 
I totally support people encouraging people to see nice as attractive, and evil as unsexy and creepy, but that is totally different from taking a selfish view, that all women should find you attractive.",78,13,2018-05-24T10:37:08.000Z

"The entitlement is strong in Incels. Seems to me that the toxic masculinity that pervades forums like the Incel subreddit and 4chan, creates an atmosphere where this kind of misogyny festers into the terrible incident that shed light on these type of people in the first place. 

I could be described as Incel; 12 years divorced and no relationship, but the difference here is, I know I could change my situation if I was motivated to do so. So I'm not really an Incel. I've made a choice to be this way. It still saddens me that lonely people misdirect their frustration and turn it into rage, directed at women who are in no way at all responsible for the Incel's misplaced rage. It's encouraged by other Incels, bcz chatting on forums with people who think and act like you is somewhat therapeutic. Somewhere along the line, the denial of responsibility, the blame culture and MRA-sourced weaponised misogyny coalesces into something dangerous to everyone.

"These men have typically been dealt with by enlisting them in war in the past. Typically you want them on the front lines to unleash their rage and die as fodder for older high value male generals and society in general. The downside is the depraved behavior in war including rape. Don't let such troops take civilian towns or strongholds. This is not a small problem by any stretch...where there are imbalances between male and female populations there are dramatically increased levels of violence, prostitution, vice crimes, rapes, misogyny, depression and so on. This is especially present in northern India and will soon be a problem in China. This is not a movement, it is a consequence ot social imbalances. It needs to be addressed. In the case of Western men it tends to be down to increasing socio economic stratification and disparity in their perceived value in a material and capital value based economy. The West would actually benefit from enticing these men into armed service and covering their actions in war with media propaganda.",2,1,2018-05-17T21:03:27.000Z

"I've yet to see claims of ""research"" knowing the few rules of the internet. The first being a lot of users shit-post and exaggerate things just to get reactions. That and when anyone ""vents"" about frustrations in life it's certainly gonna go into more angry and  hurt territory. But just like Veronica probably doesn't truly mean ""All men suck!"" after her heart-broken break up with Steve or Billy, not all guys who seem to hate women on the surface actually ""hate all women"". When any human being feels betrayed or ostracized they're gonna lash out either at the group they perceived wronged them or society at large. Most of us just eventually ""move on"" but anyone ""twice bitten"" is going to be thrice shy. Regardless Incels probably have a few good points though I don't think anyone is ""entitled"" to sex or ""entitled"" to a life partner. But do we live in a modern society that under-appreciates men and is more apt to coddle women? Yes. Do many women today have some pretty ridiculous expectations on what they find to be an ideal man? Yes. Should we perhaps care more why men and boys commit suicide at alarming rates? Yes.

Regardless, it's easy to see an inflammatory post and simply conclude that person is an asshole or waste of oxygen. Online interactivity has created more knee-jerk reactions than ever before. But I find ""most of us"" have been thru our ""pissed off at the world"" and angst ridden stages in life too. Even a good person can occasionally say or type what seem to be anti-social unpleasant things. This is why when ""researching"" such material I know better to take everything at face value. Sometimes a ""Fuck you and the whore you rode in on!"" is actually a cry for help. Sometimes a troll who constantly uses the mantra/meme ""Kill yourself!"" is the one who is truly depressed and only hanging on to life by a thin thread. Likewise, sometimes someone who seems ""creepy"" is just trying really hard to come out of their own shell.

As for the ""fake number"" tactic I've been at the end of that when NOT being a danger to the person I was asking the number of. Besides, we were both in a public place with cameras and people. I understand if she was ""uncomfortable"" but she could have just said she moved into a new place and had yet to decide on her phone service provider or that she got in a pinch and had to pay a late service charge before getting her phone privileges back. Those are lies too but what makes the ""fake number"" insidious is that person is going to go to the trouble dialing the fake number only to realize they got crapped on. And this can be exceptionally awkward if say you have to see that person again because she's local and works at a store you regularly shop at. This is why ""lies"" aren't always ideal. Still, the best one of all is ""Oh,that's really sweet you wanna talk and hang out but I have a boyfriend at the moment and my friends from outta state are coming to see me!"" Most guys I know immediately fuck off when they think a boyfriend is in the picture. I know I do because either A. She ""really"" has a bf and I don't want to be a nuisance. or B. Even if she lying it's obvious she wants nothing to do with me so I can take a hint. (If you're into girls ""I have a girlfriend"" works too. Heck, it works twice as well because most hetero guys realize they aren't gonna score with a lesbian. lol.)",1,0,2018-05-17T19:08:06.000Z

"Just one thing, personal experience here and also basic logic.
Nowdays it's pointless to give a fake number for ""safety reasons"", if you done it and it never exploded in your face you weren't dealing with someone dangerous. That's because your phone is right there and they just call it to make sure it isn't a fake number, then danger arises.

Now, you seem like an smart fellow from your videos, I'd thought you'd be smarter than that, specially smarter than giving the shittiest advice ever. Goddamn, I've been through hell for the phone not ringing soon enough because I didn't realized I was dealing with crazy. And that's my advice, do not give any number to suspicious people, only take their number and never call and delete it.

And second, yeah, the wikipedia article basically confirms it, but then say ""sample size too small"". Which is a valid point, but with the data we got he's not far off, but there are reasons for it, which includes impunity, identitarianism (or group seclusion with enforced ""loyalty""),  and a few other factors harder to explain but also explain the low on those numbers in male gay relationships besides a few other data points. And the higher than average DV in lesbian relationships does not mean lesbians are more violent, just that the bad elements ""walk around"" a lot. (one good neat factor is that a common cause for violent and controlling behavior is also a common cause for assertiveness and initiative, which is a lack of filter.)

"Watched the whole thing. At no point in the video do you really grasp the incel community at all. Your tone during the entire video is that of judgement and condescension... which is ironic because those are exactly the types of reactions that push these types of people towards murdering people. You clearly have no intention to actually empathize, despite claiming you can a few times in the video. Perfect example is when you went on a tangent about how they don't understand how relationships work. OF COURSE THEY DON'T! These are people who have no friends and no relationship experience. They probably have varying degrees of autism and mental illness. You completely ignore these facts throughout the video and instead opt for the lazy explanation that they're all just evil misogynists. 

Another revealing thing you said was ""Two weeks ago this was completely laughable"". Laughing at people who are already miserable and feel as though they have nothing to lose is exactly what drove Alek Minassian over the edge. It's all too easy for us to stand on moral high ground and condemn the attacks. But what does that accomplish? Does it change the circumstances that led to the mass murder? 

Let's be honest here, the only reason you're thinking about the topic of incels is because of the van massacre. You're a queer woman with likely little to no interest in the romantic affairs of heterosexual males. As you previously stated, the only interest you had in them before this attack was a source of laughter. Your tone throughout the video gives me the impression that you still mostly view incels as a source of humor. As long as it doesn't personally affect you then you don't really care. You only care now because the van attack happened in your city. Of course there's also the fact that you know that this plays well into your political belief in toxic masculinity and the patriarchy. 

Your point about hobbies is also just selfish projection. The guy who talked about chess didn't imply in the slightest that he took up the hobby to get in women's pants. I don't think anyone could honestly believe that a guy picked up chess as a hobby in order to impress women.

"So you say you need a decent personality to get laid and have a relationship. Yet, there are definitely people with shit personalities out there who are magnets to women or in abusive relationships,... If everyone with a bad personality would be forever single, we would have soo much more singles. Also, how do you even know that every guy who is in this situation (or even most guys who are in this situation) have bad personalities? Why instead of looking at those forums, don't you invite a human being to have a real interview and talk about their story and what their struggles are? And maybe even pick one that might challenge your stereotypes?

I don't consider myself to be an incel, whatever that even is exactly, but I am a virgin at an age that is very uncommon. And I don't really chose to be. If we took the prettiest and ugliest girl and guy on this world and use them to define a scale of beauty for females and males respectively and then put you and me on these male and female beauty scales, I am pretty sure I would not rank lower on that than you. I get noticed by women pretty often, yet I still couldn't manage to really get a girlfriend. And then even if you do manage to get into situations where this becomes more likely, the older you are with few to zero experience, the harder it becomes to keep up with a woman's expectations, so it kind of starts to become this vicious circle where it gets harder and harder to break out of it. And it can be really tragic even from the perspective of some women, because they might miss out on some very good men, who just would need to catch up a bit to get far ahead of a lot of more experienced guys. I mean, just take your favorite celebrity male and imagine he had some issues (let's say psychological) in his youth which prevented him from making these experiences early on and then later maybe starts to focus too much on his career and body to make himself more desirable only then to get rejected by a woman he makes out with, because he acts a bit weird (as in inexperienced) and gets ghosted immediately.",2,2,2018-05-16T17:35:47.000Z

"@STRANGE √ÜONS
This video is typical ""normie"" sentiment.
You have completely failed to understand the issue.

Please read this post if you would like to become informed.

In the animal kingdom, there is consistently a segment of the given population that fail to reproduce. They do not attract a mate and they do not participate in mating rituals.

Making this observation is uncontroversial and is a well-established phenomenon...

Until you make that observation about humans.
Researchers estimate that out of all the human females that have ever lived approximately 80% of them have managed to reproduce and pass on their genes to the next generation.
This is compared with the approximately 40% of males that have managed to produce offspring. These results were arrived at by studying the genes of a large population of DNA samples and comparing them with estimates of human population over the course of pre-history and history.

They may be only ballpark figures but one thing that is clear is modern humans have far more female ancestors than male ancestors.

So what is my point?

Incel is a real observable phenomenon, even in humans.
What this means...
For a given population of animals, including humans, there will be a segment of that population that has far fewer opportunities to participate in mating rituals and pass on their genes.

Something that must be addressed in the context of the incel debate.
The primary reason for lustful and romantic desires are to fulfill our sex drives which are the instinctual motives that compel us to produce offspring for the survival of our species. Any additional benefits of mating ritual behaviors are secondary or a bonus to those instincts. The primary reason for mating rituals in humans is to procreate not to ""find companionship"" or any other abstract motive which is not necessarily essential to the survival of the species. 
Citing exceptions to this general condition among human populations, like asexuality, for example, does not disprove that general rule.

What I see happen when people are confronted with this information?
Denial. Especially among the average person or ""normie."" People want to believe that each human is a master of their own destiny. This makes them free to act as they please, as well as responsible for their actions. So what ensues from there among normies and incels is a blame game. Normies blame incels, incels blame the opposite sex.

But it boils down to a nature vs nurture debate.

There is evidence to support both positions, being incel could be as a result of nature and it can be as a result of nurture. That is to say that both nature and nurture can contribute to incel phenomenon.

What does that mean?

It means when normies go blaming incels that does not help anybody because it is not entirely the incels fault, they can't help that they are naturally unattractive. And when incels blame the opposite sex that does not help anybody, we can't completely control what we find attractive because a lot of that is instinctual.

:::::::Please read before responding:::::::
What I said in this post.
""Being incel is not completely within a person control""

If you heard
""Being bitter, hostile, misogynistic and violent is not completely within a person's control""

Then you should reread this post.
I am not disputing that one's attitude is something within their control and I am not defending hostility, misogyny, or violence.

I am merely pointing out that some people have few opportunities to participate in human mating rituals and it is through no fault of their own or anybody else's fault.",0,4,2018-05-16T17:31:58.000Z

Others but n a big but just like anything else in life it depends on the person and also humans are social that's y isolation is used as torture technique u can be driven mad over time.,3,1,2018-05-16T14:38:46.000Z

Trust me, women aren't ignoring you because they'd rather have some pretty boy. It's a lot deeper than that. Also, even if the girl you're chasing is interested in looks, what's wrong with that?

"(Not an Incel but I get it)
Image walking across the desert. You're not alone, there are other people walking too. Some of them are eating and some of them are foraging for food. You yourself have some experience looking for food but not very good at catching it, so you do the natural thing and ask for bit of food. Naturally you get rejected, not everyone likes to share. You keep looking trying to find a bit of food to satisfy your hunger. The Imagine years and years go by and you still haven't caught any food. Continually watching everyone else eat, watching how people throw away their food disrespectfully, and most importantly watching people mistreat their food. At this point it is easy for hatred to form. Many people are lost in life and things in their life just simply didn't go the way they wanted it to.  I understand what it means to be lonely on the path of life and vulnerable to hatred. Laughing at them in mocking them only makes it worse. What may be a minor issue to some, tends to be a major issue to others.  Dark actions lead to greater darkness.  Strong people fight. Weak people kill. These people are obviously weak, so it's natural that they would kill. In my opinion, these people just need a little bit counseling, or some real friends to correct that behavior.",4,3,2018-05-15T21:45:06.000Z

"What is inherent to women is that they are incapable of love empathy ( excepting Maternal infantilism) which are inferior because they have no real sexual desires , like men. Their main drive is their pathological Narcissism and preference for Hypergamy, in other words the social order of half a million years of barbarism , prior to  the 12000 years of patriarchy. except that unlike that barbaric period they now have total control of sex. In a mere 60 years of sex crimes , they have anihilated patriarchy. Women understand other women and they hate them as well , their bitch culture, pathological Narcissism is their only concern , like some one with extreme anti social personality disorder. Incell is not self created nobody chose it , but she freely chooses Lesbian Femicide , Which has no place in nature , since nature is overwhelmingly sexual reproduction. The incell political conciousness isn't some gringe aberration of losers it's an objective rational logical factual reflex to totally unprecedented intolerable dysfunction pathology and genocide. Incell are the socially progressive movement, she isn't and never can be , Femists have shown us the actual ugly truth about their own Whoredom , what they always were , and which ,12000 years of patriarchy tried to cover up. Incell are the good guys, she is the problem 100% .Needless to say the female orgasm doesn't exist , pathological liars , colder than reptiles worse  than psychopaths , telling lies is inherent to their evolution.

"Has anyone here ever heard of the term ""courtship disorder""? It seems that many of the issues that ""incels"" face are rooted in a very serious courtship disorder. While they claim that it's a bad thing that women choose men based on looks, the entire theory of evolution supports a more complex courtship ritual among humans. When biology is driving the mating game women are more discerning because that is to their evolutionary advantage--so it's hardwired. Seeking a mate is more complicated than consenting to a hookup with an emotionally distant person. In humans, courtship behavior is about pair-bonding. Men who have a courtship disorder are never quite able to coordinate their courtship ""dance"" with a prospective mate and initiate the pair-bonding sequence. In modern society where food, shelter, and entertainment is ubiquitous, but relationships are not, many fall into the trap of feeling an entitlement to everything they want. 

Those with courtship disorders feel the need to externalize the internal pain they endure from not receiving that which they want. That is understandable but doesn't fix the problem of blaming others for their own feelings of want. I suggest they embrace Buddhism and study the Third Noble Truth. Freedom from suffering starts with freedom from wanting.",0,0,2018-05-13T02:54:53.000Z

step 1: don't be annoying or whiny about your sex less life people do feel bad for you if your homeless not because your a virgin it really is easy to have sex with someone you just not be annoying or whiny in general keep your feelings and thoughts to yourself and you get laid faster.
step 2: actually not be a asshole- so the asshole type posts you make go to go or opinions have to changed to get laid.

"I understand you're mostly here to get your mass shooting clicks, you do your hustle, but I'll try to shed some light for anyone who cares to understand.
This is as a non-incel looking in from the outside to the beginnings of the group identity around involuntary celibacy taking form online.

First off, this all develops around ""communities"" like 4chan, politically incorrect as much as possible, dirty banter, thick skin, etcetera. So try to apply that grain of salt to the rest.
Incel starts off as an insult, it's primarily used by non-incels and incels alike (coming back to this later) to pretty much call someone a virgin in internet-speak.
Much like people use ""Snowflake"" to mean ""Thin-skinned"".
When you read shit like ""Beta uprising"" and ""Incel rebellion"" these are either non-incels making fun of incels with a veil of irony, or incels making fun of other incels as to distance themselves from their own condition. There is no ""Incel Rebellion"". It's not an ideology. It's more meme and self-deprecating irony than anything.
Like snowflake eventually Incels adopted the insult and formed a group identity around it.
The reason for the group identity forming is that these are primarily young men who understand that they've got the short end of the genetic lottery.
They have no future socially speaking, which feeds a vicious cycle of loneliness>sedentary lifestyle>Isolation>Physical and Psychological Damage>loneliness.
Today networking, in the traditional sense, is how people get around life. It's not much about what you can do, it's much more about how you are around other people, who are you friends with, etc.
Billionaire Daniel Pena, who trains promising young men and women into enterpreneurship says ""Show me your friends and I'll show you your future.""
And coming back to the Physical and Psychological Damage, isolation does actually cause permanent damage to any human being, this can be observed even in primates.
In short, the society we run just isn't for them and they have no way out.

Whether the cause is lack of socialization during childhood, trauma, socially debilitating autism, or just being born really fucking ugly, these people just can't be social at all.
And you've probably seen them, skulking by themselves at school, shaky voices, sometimes smelly, never talking to anyone.
These are non-functional people.
The isolation severely affects the capacity of their brain to process empathy, on a neurological level, it literally deteriorates with loneliness, along with brain function in general.

The incel communities themselves are nothing more than a hugbox, they scream into the void, echo each other out, more often then not shit all over each other as well because they hate themselves as well, accomplish nothing, but in the process feel less lonely in their isolation.
This obviously does not help their condition, quite on the contrary the pseudo-interaction worsens it exponentially as the realization of not being alone in being isolated starts justifying envy, until it becomes jealousy of something that could have been theirs ""if only"" they were taller, better spoken, more outgoing , etc.

The media proclaiming these people as some kind of terrorist militia is not only factually incorrect, but potentially catastrophic.
What do you think will be the outcome of people with no future and nothing to lose, when the group identity of ""Terrorist militia"" is shoved onto them?
Do you think that people who are willing to accept the label of ""Forever Virgin"" will have a hard time picking ""Terrorist Militia"" up?

To conclude, of course these people are fucked, their belief system is fundamentally broken, a spree killing of 10 people should never happen, but if reading through those posts you couldn't tell that these are desperately in need of help, perhaps you need some help as well.
You can't blame the people around them for isolating them either , as it is a very strong evolutionary instinct to outcast people who show signs of poor genetics (Ugliness, lack of social skills, low verbal IQ, celibacy itself even), if you're at school *try to direct them to a counselor or otherwise a psychologist.* Chances are they won't do much, but perhaps there are losses that can be cut.",3,0,2018-05-11T10:30:20.000Z

They claim that they are better people than ""Chads"" or attractive men but show through their words and their actions that they are terrible people. They act as if all ""ugly"" men are good people and all ""attractive"" men are terrible people.
I've seen posts from these incels that say they don't want to be with a fat or unattractive women because it makes them feel bad about themselves because they have to settle for ""the bottom of the barrel"". How can they not see the hypocrisy in that? You expect attractive women to be with you even though you call yourself ugly/fat but don't expect them to feel the same way you do (not that normal people think that way- but in their minds, apparently everybody does)",226,108,2018-05-11T03:29:50.000Z

I can put my head on his shoulder when both of us are standing and we can almost share clothes because we are also both skinny with an insane metabolism. This relationship already lasts for over 8 years now. 
I'm very much demisexual(leaning very much to the asexual side) queer and all people look equally good to me.

I don't even really look at people's faces I think people who are nice are beautiful not people who have a nice face.

Especially if the men have not had any meaningful or intimate relationship with a woman, they have no foundation or idea of what a real relationship actually entails. Just their fantasy/imagination. Think about how you thought of your crushes as pre-teen prior to actually dating/having sex and how completely absurd your idea of relationships often are before you have any. I think for many incels it's the same deal, they are stuck in pre-puberty mentality of dating/relationships/sex and have no idea of the real dynamics that go into it.

"About the whole fake number thing, Id say be really careful about when you use it. I think its totally fine if you have made it clear you are not interested and the guy wont take the hint, then yeah, give him a fake number, hes a prick. 
But if hes just a bit awkward, its probably more a case of him not being very experienced, and giving him a fake number is probably only going to make him develop trust issues with women (which is likely to end up making him a bit of a mysogonist). Really he needs to be rejected so he can learn its not actually that big of a deal. As long as you are nice about it, it should be fine. Of course if he reacts to the rejection by insulting you then you can totally tell the twat to fuck off. 
A word on the whole feeling like you are in danger thing, the only guys (and women) who you are really in danger from are sociopaths/psychopaths, and the idea that men who are socially awkward, weird loners are secret serial killers is a complete Hollywood fabrication (making them weird is an easy way to establish that we arent meant to identify with them). Real sociopaths are incredibly manipulative (which you literally cant be without good social skills), don't give one shit about what anyone thinks of them (therefor no social anxiety) and are often the most gregarious person in the room. You are actually way more likely to look at someone who is unbeknownst to you, a sociopath and think ""wow they look really fun, Id love to hang out with them"" than you are to think ""wow what an awkward weirdo""",0,0,2018-05-09T19:19:53.000Z

"Since this comment is more likely to reach you here than at incels.me, i'mm gonna copy and paste it here:

""She takes something as benign (to normies) as a user saying he feels miserable and depressed when he sees teenagers being romantic, and she somehow turns that into being an attack on all human beings and an example of incels being selfish?
Wow, women must be perfect creatures if they've never felt envy in their lives. We missed out on having love in our lives, how are we selfish for feeling depressed from that? If a kid is an orphan and sees other kids with loving families do you think they're not gonna feel some type of way seeing that? Of course they are, and that doesn't make them selfish, they've missed out on something that's supposed to be a key element in human growth just due to circumstances, a lot like us. That comes with feelings of loneliness and isolation, you would feel that way too if suddenly you were disfigured and no one showed you any type of love, just cold indifference at best.

In another part she notes that post where someone noted how thousands of incels kill themselves everyday and society doesn't give a shit. Her genius response is ""SHE DID IT TO THEMSELVES, WHO CARES!!!"", which is funny considering how high the rate of suicide is/was in the LGBT community which she is apart of. Increased risk of suicide is something to take note of if it's happening in a particular populace, that's not a non-issue just because ""people are doing it to themselves"". Loneliness causes thousands of suicides per year in the USA, loneliness is linked as being more deadly than obesity. I know they don't give a shit because they don't care about us on an inherent level, they'd rather we kill ourselves than continue living, but I can't help but call her out on this bullshit regardless.

Normies are incapable of having empathy for incels. As evidenced in this video they'll read any sentence by us and immediately set out to find issue with it regardless of how benign it is, they wont attempt to empathize even a little with the raw feeling expressed in some posts. This is especially true for ones like Rachel Oates or whoever this chick is, they're good looking white women who as a result cant even slightly sympathize with the experiences of undesired men on incel forums who are as genetically opposed to them as can be. The experiences of a short, ugly, ethnic man is two worlds apart from a good looking white woman, and they don't recognize that fact so they crusade against us without a care in the world, or alternatively they do recognize that fact and want to make us extremely miserable which is even worse.""
