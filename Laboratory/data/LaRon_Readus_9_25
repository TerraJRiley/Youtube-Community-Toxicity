I played Telltale's Batman and Jurassic Park games, and have the Back to the Future one as well. I always appreciated and enjoyed their work, and I wish nothing but the best for the former employees in their future endeavors.

"I'm a white queer female, but I was a daddy's girl when I was little. I was into dinosaurs, playing outside, Barbie PC games, and being cute and small when I was young, but I got increasingly more opposed to feminine stuff because it was feminine and therefore would make me look weak, lame, bad, etc.. I'm pretty sure this was at least partially due to my dad. I don't remember much myself, but my mom tells me he was very sexist and would harass her and other women for basically existing (example: ""a woman should only be two things, barefoot and pregnant"" is something she heard him tell his buddies _while pregnant with me_ ). He's the type of person that hates minorities (including Mexicans even though one of his sisters had a Mexican father) and seems to insist that he's the best, most flawless person alive despite being a dick to pretty much everyone. I see that discrimination sometimes when I visit him, though it's not as severe as it was.

I'm not really sure if that's considered hyper-masculinity or not, but growing up with those thoughts as a kid and through puberty might have lead to me feeling uncomfortable with my biological sex and might explain why I don't really identify as a woman today. I feel pretty weird about it, like it makes me sexist to not feel comfortable identifying as a woman because of all of that, but if I try to force myself to feel totally comfortable with myself I dissociate more than usual so idk.",0,0,2018-09-13T06:49:19.000Z,Almandine Sapphire,UCsl4OcmoI2J-IgELoVSFRuQ,FRITu5ntiQ4,True,UgzUHX5v4V_WDU2GSrF4AaABAg

"I wish I could figure out exactly why my attraction to monstrous (or at least not 100% human) characters began. I think it started with Beast Boy (and Raven, as I realized in later years after embracing my queerness), but ever since it's become a kind of disturbing ""shadow"" of my ""normal"" sexuality and sense of attraction. I think my attraction to zombies in middle school _may_ have been a subconscious expression of me feeling attracted to my friend who had enforced what was then my general liking of zombies, because around that time I had a rough time wrestling the idea that I liked girls and guys, a concept that I actually hadn't really been exposed to until I met her. I'm 99% sure my fling for Slenderman stemmed from my emerging daddy issues, as I always thought of him as a father figure (for some strange reason or another). More recently, demons and fallen angels that actually look like demons and not just hot guys with horns and tails have been intriguing. 

At some point in my past, I think this all originated from the realization that I was (and still am hahaa) fat and conventionally unattractive, in addition to the sense of edginess I embraced at being a tomboy and how I thought I was better than other girls for disliking traditionally feminine things. As I got older and hung out with my aforementioned friend (who turned out to be really toxic lmao, like she'd encourage me to only hang out with people in our ""clique"" [which barely existed in a school with like 15 kids per class] because ""preps"" didn't like us), I think the feeling of isolation and rejection from others started to become a huge reason why monsters were and still are attractive to me. Monsters are shunned and tend to be alone, whether due to hiding or being shunned; I understand what that feels like. I think now, with my isolation being a lot worse than it was in high school _and_ with my dad villainizing me for not being his perfect little girl (or boy, I still wonder if he tried to bring me up as the son he always wanted, which would explain my gender identity issues too lol), the symbolic attraction is relevant once again.

I mean, that doesn't really help me understand why I find quite a few monstrous characters _physically_ attractive despite (because of?) typically ""strange"" looks. Some examples: skeletons, literal facelessness, masked entities (outside of the ""it's a stranger"" concept, because I can rule that out for several characters I've found attractive; examples are the Yautja/Predators and Pyramid Head), living corpses, ghosts (the whispy kind like Johann Krauss, not like Patrick Swayze), etc. etc. Humorously, the fact that I feel this way makes me feel more of an outcast, which makes it all come full circle. Seriously, does anyone know why that might be other than be just being really messed up? I'm pretty sure I didn't have a traumatic introduction to sexuality so I don't think it's like a warped interpretation of that.

"This is made more difficuld, because the original ""Star Trek"" is explicitely utopian Science Fiction. The race of Uhura or Sulu is never the subject of any plotline, because, instead of reflecting on current events, they chose to present a future society, in which the characters had, maybe, heard about racism in school, but never thought to connect it wit themselves, because it was as distant for them as the Spanish inquisition is for us.
So, the most faithful and most effective way of representation of queer people would probably be none.

"I saw sorry to bother you and blackkklansman back to back in one day, and I think that was a disservice to klansman, because I ended up fucking loving sorry to bother you so much. I thought it was overall well done, I agree that Driver and Washington were the best parts of the film, and I thought the soundtrack was amazing (I went home and immediately downloaded it). I liked the way the story was told overall, the pacing was good, and I liked some of the visual style in some scenes (like when Ron and Duke are on the phone and the screen is split diagonally between them). That being said, after seeing sorry to bother you earlier that day, I found the thematic message of the film (while important, and I’m glad it’s there) to be less impactful than the other movie. I liked the ending though, where he relates the theme of the movie to the larger sociopolitical conversation going on right now. I think everyone needs to see this movie for the ending alone. 

I want to watch it again on a different day, with fresher eyes, to see if I would connect to it more, and to see if some of my criticisms would still hold up after a second watch. It was also my first spike lee movie, so perhaps some of the things that took me out of the movie were his “isms” I’m not aware of.

"Bit of a correction: Neflix is splitting up a lot of their recent shows. The new seasons of Kimmy Schmidt and Arrested Development were broken into two parts, to qualify for Emmy consideration, I believe. So that's less about mimicking traditional serialization so much as vying for prestige and legitimacy.

I'm bummed by Michelle Wolf's cancellation but I admit I wasn't super diligent about checking in every week, despite still watching The Daily Show/The Late Show/Seth Meyers regularly.

"""The monsters in monster movies were a perfect allegory for what it meant to be queer, a person of colour, or both."" I wanna chime in that, as a person who is neurodivergent/on the autism spectrum, I also relate a lot to inhuman monsters in media because of that. I draw myself as a big red beast-y thing, and a thought that I have a lot is ""I want to be a monster, because I've never been good at being a /person/ in the first place."" Monsters aren't ever expected to catch onto/understand all these really subtle social cues that my dumb brain just has so much trouble wrapping around to interact with others properly. They don't get punished for when they don't ""act right"" by human standards, because they're not human and thus not expected to act like one. Any time I feel I've messed up with interacting with someone, my brain just swamps with thoughts along the lines of ""am I a bad person? I don't want to be bad, I want to be good, please tell me what I did bad so I don't do it again, please, please.""
But of course asking that of every person I talk to is also not really socially acceptable. 

As for monsters that I've crushed on, I had the BIGGEST shmoopy crush on the wraith Raziel from Legacy of Kain.... still kinda do;;; His story is a very sad one, with the parts of his life you actually see as you play the game being the ones where he just... is never happy. Nothing really good ever happens to him. He hates the wraith he's become, often comparing his gnarled, ""demonic"" appearance to the much more ""angelic"" ancient vampires he's trying to learn more about in his second game of the series. I just want to grab him up and hug him and tell him he is still super pretty and just try to do whatever I could to make him happy, make him feel loved, and valued. He's one of my big comfort characters, that I like to think about being happy and feeling nice whenever I'm... not feeling such myself.

Another big comfort character I have that I really just want to hug to bits and make feel better is Dr. Loboto from Psychonauts. He's  not a monster, but was called such by his parents when he was little, for things that he had absolutely no control over. They even had him receive a lobotomy (and other as of yet unknown brain surgeries) to try and ""fix"" what was ""wrong"" with him. In his case, it was psychic powers, but really, the treatment his parents give him is saddeningly similar to how a lot of parents treat their autistic kids. My own parents are loving, understanding, and accepting of my autism, but fuckin' /nobody else/ ever was (especially other kids in school, from 1st grade to highschool graduation). The whole thing makes Loboto's backstory really strike a chord with me, and whenever I look at him I'm just ""y'know what? I'M your mom now. You're like 30 years older than me but that doesn't matter /I'm your mom now./""

The monster I draw myself as is part of a whole original species I came up with, with some of their defining traits being that they're big and strong, have an air of gentleness and safety about them for beings that need that, and intimidating as all fuck vibes to people with ill intentions. I'm small and meek in person, so being a monster like that would help me protect and comfort all these other monsters so much better.

"Late to the game on this, but for me, it was always robots, cyborgs, golems, and other artificially created/adapted life.  Part of it is that I am actually a real-life cyborg (titanium prosthetic stapes bone!), but another part is that I find it most relatable as a queer, trans, disabled person.

The prosthetic stapes bone doesn't function.  The first surgery I underwent willingly, but... well... malpractice happened.  I got very sick.  I lost all my hearing in that ear.  And when it became clear that I wasn't getting better, my family put me through another surgery, which I didn't want.  I was almost eighteen, but I did not get a choice.  And my hearing didn't come back.  It never will.

As an adult, I realized that I underwent an unnecessary medical trauma, one that had some pretty awful complications afterward, one that was painful and degrading and debilitating... all because my parents couldn't bear the thought of having a hard of hearing child.  Even though I don't mind my hearing loss at all now, and my impairment in the modern world is pretty minimal.  Had I just been left alone, things would've turned out the same way, only much slower, with far less vomiting, bleeding, crying, and pain.

Compare this to the procedures I have willingly undergone as a trans person, which also sometimes were painful and degrading, but which I don't regret having.  People see my transition as butchery, rather than my failed ear surgeries, but it was transitioning that made me feel better.  Because it was something I chose willingly to be me, rather than something forced on me to make me ""normal."" The cyborg narrative is one of adaptation, of trauma--hardly anyone becomes a cyborg through pleasant, desired means.  It can also be one of self-determination.  That is something I relate to.

Robots, borgs, and golems often also have a castration or genderless aspect to them, this sense that they aren't REALLY their gender because they aren't ""real."" Obviously this is very relatable on a trans level (especially since I do not pass), but there's also a much deeper psychological aspect I experience as a disabled person.  One of the themes of the abuse I experienced from my family was that I wasn't their ""real"" child.  I had stolen, possibly murdered that child, and I was to be punished for it.  I was a cheap sham, a fake person, one that shouldn't exist.  So robots fighting to be seen as people in their own right, trying to find their way in the world?  That's my jam!

My entire adult life has been fighting for the right to be me, to be a person, in all my broken cyborg glory.  Plus it's way, WAY easier to find stories about cyborgs and robots than trans queer disabled people.",0,0,2018-08-24T23:39:32.000Z,Horple McTweenbot,UC-P7hNJkIEU9hbMI4jzYuXA,ERrVNKEQJA8,True,UgwS9-Yo-vVNmflwxBF4AaABAg

"I do think at least, there is plenty of room for daily or weekly content on Netflix as a platform but late night TV isn't quite the same as TV show / documentary shows because late night content like Joel McHale (which I liked) and Wolf's The Break (which I didn't like) are TIMELY which is what I assume is the stumbling block.

You can actually watch most / almost all of The Daily Show's past episodes on Comedy Central's site but I can't remember the last time I did that. If I miss two weeks of Daily Show I'm unlikely to go back to them because I've already read and digested those news stories, at best I'll just watch the interviews if someone interesting was on. Unless Netflix is a daily event for people (which it might not be if they only use it to binge) any show with a high timeliness is probably going to fail I think.

Something more like Wyatt Cynac's Problem Areas (HBO) might be a better fit for the Netflix model with content that's less timely but still has a (loose) late night style format? I think the area of late night TV shows could use a shake up (there was just an article I saw about how Carpool Kareoke is wearing out its welcome so other people feel that way too), it'd be interesting if Netflix could do a nightly show that brings back variety style bits (a la: In Loving Color or SNL) where some of the pieces could be more timely and others more general.

I personally loved the Joel McHale show with Joel McHale and I'd watch it every Sunday night but I also check Netflix every day but don't tend to watch more than 1 or at most 2 episodes of anything in a row so I recognize I'm not the average Netflix user :p",0,0,2018-08-21T11:05:07.000Z,Mab Miller,UCx15LuCvCvfpaff3jZQcHxg,xvBcmH36d6k,True,UgxbXRQb9J9H9xNjCC94AaABAg

"The reason late night talk shows don't work as good on something like Netflix isn't JUST because of the binge-watching format.

"Ghorbash the Ironhand from Skyrim.
The first time I played the game I was immediately drawn to the Orcs.  I loved that their culture and their religion and family structure portrayed them as individuals who held themselves and everyone else accountable to their actions.  That no one is exempt from what they do or say and must take full responsibility for those they hurt or help.
Coming from a very abusive family who protected the biggest abuser, you can see why this mindset appealed to me.
Secondly, their culture and many of the individual orcs you meet in the game, have a resilience to them.  Even if they've been dealt a shit hand, they push on and see it as a test of their strength and integrity.
So the first time I played and talked to Ghorbash, you discover that he is unhappy living life in a stronghold and misses the freedom of traveling and seeing the world.  And even when he had freedom, he was serving in the legion (basically army) and thus was never actually able to fully experience making decisions for himself about what he wanted or where to go.

You as the player give him an out.  Wherein he can honorably choose to become your follower while at the same time not disgracing his family by leaving again.
This is pretty much a metaphor for my whole life.  I was able to escape my abusive home and live by my own choices because someone was kind enough to team up with me.
And while Ghorbash wasn't necessarily an abuse victim, he was still a prisoner of his familial obligations.
From there I experienced the rest of the game world feeling as if he was my mentor, teaching me about combat and other people and what he knew.
I marry him no matter what race or gender I play as.
One a purely physical level, I have always been drawn to features such as heavy brows, hard set jaw lines, and scars.
I also don't know what it is about green or grey skin that gets me going but it does.  I  love his piercing blue eye (as the other is blind) and just respect how much he looks like he's gone through in life and can still have a young sense of adventure and passion.  I fantasize about kissing him every day (among other things) and how his tusks would feel brushing against my cheek.

His dialogue when you marry him melts my heart (i'm getting weepy just writing this).  I have a heart shaped necklace where I carry his picture behind glass.  Looking at it fills me with this bittersweet comfort.",0,0,2018-08-17T08:11:11.000Z,Bear- Chan,UCptcAe4uBhVDhpKhvVnwWTw,JSWhMjhu3bM,True,Ugyljcq3x_dPvSvZIyx4AaABAg

"I like to be optimistic, so I'm going to hope that the Kraven and Felicia Hardy movies are at least decent if they do end up being made, as those are the only two characters I care about out of the...rather peculiar selection Sony's cherry-picked from the Spider-Mythos..except for Silk, which leads me to my next point.

When Into The Spider-Verse comes out and does well, I hope Sony decides to make Silk the focus of their next animated movie; and if not just her then she can team up with Ghost Spider for an actually good Female Duo-led movie from the Spider-Mythos.

Beyond that I'd like to see a more serious-toned Agent Venom animated movie way down the line and a movie focused on Doctor Octopus' tragic childhood, with the film ending with him opening a chamber and closing it...right as a huge, blinding flash of green enters the screen to reveal a silhouette of Doc Ock's rising tentacles before they slam down and the credits begin to role.

Honestly, I wouldn't mind a Supervillain Line of Marvel/DC Movies. Show us how these guys came to be so bad.

They engage in and encourage self-care and self-actualization, they parent their children as a team, they give people second chances, they value art and beauty. They are largely detached from the outside world of conventional society, not out of fear or resentment or a sense of superiority, they just enjoy living the way they do. One of the main jokes of the show is that they don't even seem to realize that ""they are the weird ones"" because their worldviews are based on their own values and they have an unshakable sense of self-worth. I want to be like that. And honestly my favorite thing about the old tv show and the reason that's my favorite version of the Addams Family is that they're good people. Everything they do comes with good intentions and they always abide by the golden rule, the issue is that they're adorably unaware of typical conventions and how oddly they come across to other people, so their genuine acts of generosity are not always interpreted as intended. They have odd interests and appearances and habits and people immediately think the worst of them, but as audience members we can see that they're kind, hospitable, generous, fun-loving, friendly, creative, open-minded, progressive, confident, and loving people who seek to grow as individuals. Gomez and Morticia are everything I like about myself and everything I want to be. There is nothing monstrous about their personalities at all, they're people any one of us would be lucky to have in our lives, but everyman characters on the show can't see that because of their own prejudices and assumptions. If that isn't the most clear analogy for various oppressed groups, I don't know what is. As for me, I'm queer, trans, neurodivergent, full of obscure and taboo interests, deeply into bdsm (figured that out way before I realized I was queer), and was secretly agnostic raised in an extremely religious community that claimed non-believers were horrible people, so I adored the Addams Family from the first time I saw a rerun on tv as a kid. I had never seen anything like it before and, really, I haven't since. The idea that you could be completely unacceptable to society and still be a good person worthy of and able to obtain love from others and from yourself and find joy in what makes you different was revolutionary to me. It's rare to find a show with so much emphasis, intentional or not, on self-acceptance and self-love.",0,0,2018-08-14T12:09:56.000Z,carikittygeek,UCwdZHSf6CZeuJURJAxCBDMA,ERrVNKEQJA8,True,UgyHuFLa5wv-8kGNuVx4AaABAg
"My thing has always been more on the androids and aliens side of the ""monster"" spectrum. He doesn't really count as a monster, but Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation is probably my most significant ""monster"" crush. (Also numerous aliens here and there throughout the show.) I've always felt different from other people, like I was on the outside looking in, for a lot of reasons. I'm queer and non-binary. I've got hella childhood and adolescent trauma from abuse at the hands of my parents and being raised in an insular religious extremist cult. I don't know if most people realize this, but when you spend your formative years in a cult community, you end up with a worldview and set of experiences that very few people can relate to, you lack a lot of typical experiences, and you have a lot of ignorance about the world and what's considered ""normal"" even after you've been out of the cult for a while. I've also been realizing lately that I might be autistic. Even if that's not the case, I've got so much else going on that I don't think it's hard to see why I would become attached to an android who's the only one of his kind, struggles to recreate others' experiences for himself, is open-hearted and naive and sort of an observer and wants to be more like others and to love and be loved. He's also pretty neutral/unclear when it comes to questions of his gender and sexuality, which both made him easier to relate to and non-threatening for me. Not only could I connect with his character, but he represented so much of what I wanted. Even though there is no one else like him, he is not only accepted by others and treated with dignity, he is loved and cherished and the things that make him different are valued by those who love him, not just tolerated. By some metrics, he doesn't have emotions or empathy, but as audience members, we can clearly see that he does. He loves his friends, he misses them when they are gone, he is saddened by seeing injustice and pain and confused by cruelty, and there are times when he seems heartbroken. He is still treated as subhuman sometimes by others, and even had his autonomy legally disputed, but his friends fiercely defend him and he wins the case. His greatest wish throughout the show is to feel the way ""humans"" do. His greatest pain is in his loneliness, his feelings of inadequacy because of his ""deficiencies,"" and his sense of missing out on experiences that his peers take for granted. He's actually a very emotionally driven character, maybe even moreso than some other members of the main cast. There's a tragedy to his character but he finds peace and joy in his friendships, which make him feel like he belongs. Even to people who don't necessarily see themselves in him, there is so much to love. He is gentle and sincere and curious and loyal and forgiving, he cares about everyone's well-being and readily sacrifices himself for others. He's sort of a wide-eyed innocent while also being intelligent and at times even wise. His position as something of an outsider and his logic-orientedness give him perspective his peers may lack. And on the purely physical side of things, he has the capacity to be incredibly fast and strong, he looks great in a Starfleet jumpsuit, and he's got Brent Spiner's brilliant mannerisms, sexy voice, and adorable nose. He's made up of mechanical parts, which is an automatic advantage with me cuz I'm deeply uncomfortable with the anatomy of living creatures. (Practically every mammal including us is full of squishy pink meat and hoo boy does that make me feel uneasy.) Not to mention, he's ""fully functional and programmed in multiple techniques, a broad variety of pleasuring."" ;)))) So anyways, that's my comment.",0,0,2018-08-14T11:22:48.000Z,carikittygeek,UCwdZHSf6CZeuJURJAxCBDMA,ERrVNKEQJA8,True,UgxKsTpzffMjEl_JDxl4AaABAg

"Huh. First I've seen of this review.

I adore this movie!!! I like the sequel a little bit better for its more ""Indy action film"" feel (not to be confused with an indie action film feel), but the first one's pretty brill.

My favorite characters are Ardeth Bay, Imhotep (both of whom are absolutely nomtastic, though Imhotep only gets that way after his...de-decomposition? I dunno), and Evelyn. Rachel Weisz is a perfect balance of smart, sassy, courageous, and flawed in these films, and she and Brendan Fraser have the *best* chemistry (and lines).

It always amazed me how much they made both Jonathan and Beni the same 'kind' of character, but with such unique tweaks on them that I ended up adoring Jonathan and loathing Beni. I wish I could put my finger on it, besides the comparisons with Janosz, another character I absolutely despise.

"I'm weird in that I genuinely feel uncomfortable not doing anything that I consider to be productive, so I'm basically always doing something. 

However, notice that I specified that it was something ""I"" consider to be productive. I like to research stuff and document it - it's practically my obsession, and so long as I have a computer, access to my documents and a decent WiFi connection I can happily call myself ""productive""...even if I'm neglecting actual sh*t I need to do, any form of exercise beyond going to the bathroom to brush my teeth and get water, and social interaction beyond maybe Discord or Snapchat, and both of those are recent additions to my lifestyle.

This always ends up being at its worst in the Summer. I've been productive at documenting stuff this summer, but awful at everything else. I think I went out thrice in the past two months, and that was for my birthday, some mandatory work relating to my parents and an annual event in my village that I was basically obligated to attend, and even then I went once rather than both times like I've done in previous years.

I know that I could do better, but I've never been able to thoroughly kick my own ass enough to force myself to do it. Every year I f*ck this up and hope to do better next time, and every time I fail.

The point is this; I endure cyclical periods of possibly Depressive episodes (I'm not going to say that I have Depression, as I'm not diagnosed and self-diagnostics don't help anyone, but there's at least something there, even if I'm not sure what it is beyond a general lack of motivation beyond the stuff my head justifies as productive), have done so for years now, and by this point they seem to be worsening with time.

The best way I usually get myself out of a funk is that I listen to my favorite band on loop, take an actual break from everything and recognize what's bothering me. From that point on, I have to ask myself just how bad it really is because when it comes to me I overthink/over-analyze every little thing...and 9 times out of 10 it's usually petty nonsense. I challenge myself to simply do it and handle the bigger issues at my own pace.

This typically affects my desire to make content so when I'm in a funk on that front, I rewatch YT vids that inspired me in the first place along with looking into new stuff (like webtoons as of late....they're everything) and just get some new perspective/inspiration from new material.",2,1,2018-08-13T16:29:17.000Z,Emerald Star Productions,UCB0mvA8AswpMdVE0s9lsmUg,8E6DUCtOlgA,True,UgxY6sEdQ4Yrft00CRV4AaABAg

"alright. hoo boy. doozy time.

judge me all you want, but...
*cringe warning*

i am in love with the one and only donatello from the 2012 tmnt reboot.
yes.
a turtle.

i don’t even know what it is that made me fall in love with him. it was just a gradual thing that happened over 5 years of watching the episodes over and over again. maybe it was because i matured mentally and physically; i mean, i *was* 11 when the show came out. overtime, i connected to him in a lot of ways, like being made fun of or ridiculed for what (or well, more often or not who) he liked. i also related to him because i had nobody else to talk to about my interests, and in a couple of ways neither does he. i dunno... i don’t think it was really a “oh i relate to him so now i love him” kind of attraction. i just.... i love him.

i have this headcanon that like, when the turtles were mutated (in the 2012 series) when they were near splinter they also were mutated with some of his dna? i mean, it’d explain the whole ‘being able to have the basic human intellect to speak and feel emotions’, or whatever. but that doesn’t put him in the clear. he was never originally human. he was and still is a *turtle* .

“what is it you find attractive? his intelligence?” not really, no. i’m not saying i hate his mind, because seriously, that boy is smart. i love him for that. i just seriously think he’s hot. maybe it’s his dorky, gap-toothed grin he shoots whenever he’s happy. maybe it’s the way he expresses himself. hell, maybe it’s his APPEARANCE (don’t get the wrong idea or anything; i still love every bit of him). i have no idea where my mind decided that a nearly 6 foot tall anthropomorphic turtle is deemed boyfriend material, but it did around a year ago. god, has it been that long already?

when i think about it, though, i actually *do* relate with him, but it’s probably through my dumb mind thinking he’s often or not upset about things he’s failed to fix/do to the point where he beats himself up for it. i feel the same way and i do the same thing. i’d comfort him because i know what he’s going through.

i dunno man. all i know is that if someone payed me $10 to kiss him, i’d do it and i wouldn’t even take the money. :’)

"I might be in a very small group (I would say “minority,” but in this context I find the word gauche, ill fitting, redundant, and incorrect on a whole WHACK of levels), but I’d be more comfortable with them just rebooting Buffy instead of having this new series be a continuation of the current canon. 

Before you grab your pitchforks and torches, hear me out. If this new series were to be a sequel, it could (potentially) alienate viewers new AND old. It would alienate new viewers because this would be the first time they hear of Buffy and, should they show interest, they have to buy the DVDs and the comics (unless the comics aren’t considered canon anymore, in which case they’re totally fucked), AND THEN they have to deal with gatekeepers who want to keep the franchise “pure” (ie the way THEY like it, damn anyone else). 

And it’d alienate older viewers because it could fuck with canon so bad the only way it’d make any sort of sense is if you’re downing several bottles of strong alcohol/spirits while smoking the craziest bong imaginable.

"I'm a huge apologist for ""Teen Titans GO!"" It's goofy cartoon slapstick for eight-year-olds, but by thunder it succeeds in its modest aspirations of being a tip of the hat to the silly, irreverent glory-days of superheroics and a finger in the eye of ""Grim & Gritty"" fanboys who think the best things about the classic ""Teen Titans"" animated series were anything involving its version of the ""The Judas Contract"" storyline and all that business with Trigon. ""See? SEE? It's okay that I'm still watching cartoons! THAT DUDE'S A FREAKING DEMON! THAT'S HARDCORE, BRAH!"" So freaking what? The new series is ""Looney Tunes,"" but with capes. Get over it.

Yeah, Starfire fawns over kittens and wears a goofy mask in a blatant misunderstanding of the art of disguise (""You do not mess with THE JEFF!""), but I'll take this version over the ""New 52"" version... a walking RealDoll with the attention-span of a toddler designed to mainline spank-bait to angsty 13-year-olds and the grown-ass men who never grew out of that mindset. What's that? You don't like that Raven is a closet-Pegasister? HER VOICE-ACTRESS IS TARA STRONG, AKA PRINCESS TWILIGHT SPARKLE. That's a fantastic meta-gag. Cyborg and Beast Boy as a dumbass-slacker bromance works like gangbusters, and Robin acting like a paranoid nutcase in the hope that his sociopathic tendencies make him ""Almost As Good As My Mentor Batman!"" is an expertly-aimed pie in the face of the ""DARKNESS! NO PARENTS!"" of quite a bit of DC's other output, where it's always 1992 and the suits are convinced the only three books DC ever published that are worth a damn are ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" and ""The Death Of Superman.""

I have not yet seen ""Teen Titans GO! To The Movies,"" but I have seen its first cousin ""The LEGO Batman Movie."" And ""LEGO Batman"" was also a gut-bustingly hilarious finger in the eye of the ""Grim And Gritty"" dross that 86'd ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn Of Justice,"" ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Justice League.""

"I happened to really enjoy the book, but I get why you didn't, and I really enjoyed your video. I actually just posted something on FB regarding gatekeepers after reading a modern take on Pride & Prejudice called Darcy Swipes Left. I thought it was super clever and just really fun. I'm a writer and lit major so people found this shocking, but what can I say? A good story transcends its creative materials. Which is why my teen daughter enjoyed P & P & Zombies, and why I enjoyed Bridget Jones's Diary. Who the hell do people think they are to define which art forms / styles / iterations are allowable? YOU ARE NOT THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS! 

Now having said that, I'll admit I'm guilty to some extent of the same behavior at which I just turned up my nose. The Ghostbusters reboot really ticked me off -- not because it was an all-women cast, but because they were messing with perfection. So I can see how it's easy to get elitist and lay claim to something as a possession: This is MINE and you can't have it because you simply don't understand its worth. Fandoms are possessive... which makes sense when one considers that the word FAN literally comes from FANATIC. 

I think the key is to realize that what you enjoy can still be enjoyable even if others try to change or add to it. Someone else's joy doesn't have to negate yours.

"Regarding Gatekeeping, I'll freely admit that in the past I've bordered that line on one specific franchise: Ben 10. I grew up alongside this franchise, and at the end of the day I'm incredibly passionate about what I perceive as the good and the bad. I dislike the UAF era, don't care/hate the reboot (I alternate between the two every time I see something new about it) and like the OS and Omniverse eras. While interacting with one of my closest friends a short while ago, she mentioned that she was watching UAF for the first time and was enjoying it, and I reacted with a mixture of ""oh that's good"" and ""...seriously?"" which I realised sounded really entitled the moment I got home, so I messaged her and apologised, as I felt bad and didn't want to accidentally put her off from watching the show.

"Ok bro I hear you and to an extent I agree with you about the nostalgia stuff. Im honestly stuck to death of the constant need to return to better times bs and im locked in a im not fucking going there give with the way many things are going in the world outside of fandoms. 
I feel there's a way to bridge the old with the new as the history of anything is important to keep congruent and unaltered while adding new things and new changes that help bring old ideas into a more modernized world that help us as a people not lose sight of our core values and simultaneously allows us explore new things. 
Socially speaking bro modern social justice reforms have been great im not in favor of them all but i'm hyper about everyone getting the chance to do what makes them happy but this thing about pedophiles coming over the lgbtq flag is an absurd removal of what we as people hold in high esteem. 
Hell taking this and applying it across the board you can find a number of things where both types of nostalgia help the fit of the modern social and economical structure that's where my nostalgia is. On a time when Americans stood for real values no matter how askew we could as a nation band together. I miss the days where in our subculture of blacks the was a deeper sense of community and comradery I miss the days that transformed before us that we'll never know as anything more than a page in history.

Your use and the education of said nostalgia I can agree with and it expression the fundamental drive for this move/book.

I see where your coming from and appreciate the different meaning as you place before me in this video.

"my personal favorite monster character is actually not from a movie(since i don't watch many movies, a problem i am attempting to remedy); instead it's from a video game. Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Prince Sidon, to be exact. for a few different reasons:
for pretty much the entirety of my time during middle/high school, i kind of had a personal identity crisis. i kind of had no idea where i was on the map in terms of sexuality, or general identity. i tried on lots and lots of labels to see what fit (occasionally with wanton disregard for how that affected myself and others;;), and nothing ever felt quite right.
 i was also dealing with extreme bouts of depression, in large part because i was kind of feeling pressure from all sides to be this, that, or the other. without going into too much detail, my family and certain friend groups i had had very differing priorities and ideas about what the best way to lead my life was, and i didn't know who to listen to. as such, i often felt lost, confused, and even angry at others for seemingly trying to mold me to fit an agenda, and at myself for just kind of going with it.

now, Zelda. my first time playing Breath of the Wild was when i was about late 16 i believe (yes, i'm a youngin, i know;;), and meeting Sidon for the first time, i instantly was intrigued by not just him, but his entire background. Sidon is part of the kingdom of Zora, who for various story reasons that aren't too important to list now, aren't very fond of regular human(or Hylian) folk. but then here comes Sidon, just as positive as can be, instantly welcoming you as not just someone to help with his kingdom's problems, but as a friend and ally. like, even from your first time meeting him he's happy to see you! and then you and him ride in the water and take down a giant robot elephant together(makes sense in context), and despite how daunting and terrifying it all is, he takes it in stride, and is unwavering in his bravery and can-do attitude. for him it didn't matter how bad the threat looked - only that he was there to fight it, and then lose, and  be willing to look to others for help, and then try again. that was the kind of positivity and STABILITY that i wanted to have, wanted to live out. Sidon represented all the qualities that i aspired to be and wanted to develop - someone who could be scared and vulnerable and reach out for help, and at the same time be a pillar of stability and a rock for people who needed it. and today, i'm finally starting to develop those qualities, albeit slowly. and i feel like that encounter planted a seed that made me believe it was possible.

also, he made me very very gay (>_>)

"My personal favourites were Young Justice, Shazam! or Godzilla: King of the Monsters. 

While I don't obsess over Young Justice like many others do, I am psyched about the inclusion of the Outsiders, especially Geo-Force and Metamorpho, and personally I think that this season's going to be the best one yet.

Shazam! was a ton of fun. I had the same concerns as you regarding Billy, and while it isn't exactly like how I prefer Billy (Young Justice easily captured that essence the best), it still looks good, so I'll take it. My only reservation now is about the guy who grabbed Billy's punch; was that meant to be Doctor Sivana?...Sivana really shouldn't be catching punches.

Godzilla looks incredible. Everything has a sense of scale and majesty to it that makes you realise just how genuinely terrifying yet beautiful these creatures are, and if the rest of this cinematic universe continues to go on like this, I think it could easily rival the MCU in terms of quality after a few more films like this one.

"I got too busy to keep up with Ducktales since I already had a bunch of shows to watch and no downtime really for anything new. But uh, I might catch up just to watch that finale.

Voltron is another one of those shows that seems right up my alley (like the new She-ra) but I never found the time to binge. I'm glad they're following through and actually showing gay relationships! I gotta sit down and binge it.

I want them to rehire James Gunn because this is a symptom of a bigger problem. By Disney firing him, it proves that the alt - right can manipulate the media and give themselves power over others by playing moral outrage tactics, even if the people making the claims are entirely hypocritical and using bad faith arguments. By rehiring James Gunn, it would help to show that people both see through those kinds of tactics and can understand the difference between a false apology with no action and a sincere change of character (Gunn is the latter if that's not clear).

"Looking at all of this, I agree with your perspective on everything but Lobo. My fondness for the character has diminished a lot since I first learned of him (because far too many people ignore the fact that he was meant to be a parody of everything awful in the 1990s, and instead play him up as someone who's actually cool, hip and badass...which is totally missing the point of the f*cking character), but I like that he's still showing up in other media.

As for Dream Girl, I'm glad that this representation is happening, and hope that the comics themselves follow up on this wave by bringing back the few Transgender superheroes they have in some notable form (I'm pretty sure one of them was referenced in the Doomsday Clock map, but that's it). Also, while we're bringing Transgender DC characters into the Arrowverse, how about an appearance from Alysia Yeoh in Batwoman? I know that she's traditionally a Batgirl/Oracle character, but that hasn't exactly stopped the Arrowverse before, and honestly I expect Oracle to be a part of this cast in some capacity anyway due to her not being in Titans and the old rules regarding DCEU characters not being in the Arrowverse being rendered null by Flash, Superman, Black Canary, Deathstroke and most recently Cyborg (apparently he's going to be in Doom Patrol or something like that?) now.",0,2,2018-07-22T20:28:27.000Z,Danny Buckle,UCBArrRb2DCyLUIZMPbgNV-Q,E8rqG3ExMs0,True,UgwJciIP3__7t4X6CLh4AaABAg
"Dude, watch Voltron: Legendary Defender. While it has some pacing issues, it's still an amazing and fun show. The new season is dropping August 10th. And I know you will stan Shiro hard, since he's brave, charming and hot af. ;) 

As for the situation itself, Adam is Shiro's ex fiancee, not his current boyfriend. From what I heard about the first episode, Adam is shown in a flashback Shiro is having while is in a cyro healing pod and his soul is trying to stabilize in his clone body (very long story). In the flashback, they used to have a very strong relationship and were planning to get married. However, Shiro was chronically ill and was only able be in peak condition for a couple more years. After hearing that Shiro was planning to go on the Kerberos Mission, Adam said that if Shiro went on the mission, he would never see him again. Shiro decided to go on the mission and they broke up before Adam slammed down his engagement ring on the table and walked out.  

While I do think Adam was kinda of a dick here, I can see where he was coming from. Adam’s reaction is human. A lot of spouses just can’t handle their loved ones being away for six months to a year at a time with little contact. A lot of spouses can’t handle the risk of their loved one dying and never coming home. Divorces in the military are high for this very reason. On top of this, Shiro was chronically ill. To see Shiro willingly put himself in harm’s way terrified and angered him. Adam didn’t want to see Shiro slip away even faster. All of this was too much on them both and they decided to break up. I doubt they would get back together again after everything Shiro went through. To see VLD tackle mature subject matter like this is awesome to see. 

Also, by the way the interview sounded, Shiro and Keith (the Red Paladin and future leader of Voltron) could become end game. This isn't garenteed or anything, because who knows what pairings will become end game at this point. But the way the crew always makes fan art of this pairing (no really, you would be surprised about the amount of fan art of Shiro and Keith flirting with each other the showrunners and crew made); the way that one article said ""their relationship will get closer in the upcoming season"" and described Shiro's relationship with Adam the same way before they broke up; the fact the showrunners said all the pairings in the series are slow burn (which doesn't really fit Shiro and Adam at all) and the way they interact in the show makes it seem like a possibility. (In one episode, Shiro stutters when Keith comes back 2 years older and hotter. Being bisexual myself, I only really do that when I'm checking out someone of the same gender.

to do gargoyles justice it would have to be a trilogy. first movie based in the 1400's-1500's telling the story of how they got cursed. second movie based in today's time with how the curse is lifted and facing a new kind of threat the hunters. third movie is going against demona and david xanatos. first movie would cost around $80m using practical effects as much as possible and semi famous actor's. second movie would cost around $130m with allot of cgi involved. the third will cost about the same as the second movie. with bad movie's today hitting $300m+ and still clearing a profit this nostalgic franchise is a bankable bet. fist movie i bet would hit $400m world wide the second would hit around $500m and the same for the third installment. disney would be stupid not to let him do this there is profit to be made on a franchise like this one.,0,0,2018-07-21T21:01:09.000Z,nathan french,UCR_vxLTuhnmNfKOo5SHvrKQ,nlCpfqp1Be0,True,Ugwg_a4iTzT2J3wrWT54AaABAg

"Good day La'Ron. First, I would like to say that I love your channel and how you present topics. It is refreshing and engaging. I don't always agree with your perspective but I have to say that listening to you is way more enlightening than listening to other people. Keep up the great work. In regards to your current lesson, I believe that actors are paid to act. Whether you are a straight person playing a homosexual or a man playing a woman etc, etc. 

I feel that those who wanted to make Rub and Tug WANTED Scar Jo as their lead. If La'Ron productions wanted to make a movie and had a particular actor/actress in mind and got said actor/actress, then who cares what the public thinks? The people will speak with their wallets in the end.

Now, could a trans person play the role? Of course. Were there any that the producers wanted? Were they any good? What's the point of casting a real trans man if they suck at acting? I want to be entertained. That's the point of the movie right? To entertain through storytelling. That's how I see it.

Secondly, I get the idea of ""White Washing"" and there is some truth to that. But I also see a lopsided look at changing of characters. I.e. it's okay to take a white character and make them ethnic for ""representation"" purposes but change an ethnic character to white and all hell breaks loose. 

Yes, it is for the greater good to have more ethnic representation in the arts. It's a good thing. But, I feel the representations have to be organic. As much as I love Michael B. Jordan as an actor. (He is amazing in Creed and Black Panther). He should NOT have  taken the role of Johnny Storm in the abomination that was the Fantastic 4 reboot. That was not organic. it was ""we are going to change it..because....."". That IP has existed for a very long time and to change it just to check the block of ""being inclusive"" is wrong in my humble opinion. It's not genuine and organic to the IP. 

Bottom line, yes, we need to ensure we have greater representation in the arts, but not at the cost of piss poor performance or stroking the egos of butt hurt actors/actresses.

Mr. La'Ron, thank you for today's lesson and I look forward to your next. God Bless and may you continue to enlighten through your creative efforts.",0,0,2018-07-17T20:06:47.000Z,verdeuno,UCR_NWiCj4AVXDQUcOEeHSFQ,oUURMZiMVcA,True,UgwRCJomO6M_dZIVckp4AaABAg

"As for the Black Widow movie, we have some soul-searching to do. Let's be realistic: Marvel/Disney, while more progressive than DC/WB, will still follow the money. If Black Widow doesn't do well, then female-led superhero movies as a whole will suffer for it. We've seen it before.

However, I understand where the anger is coming from re: ScarJo.

As someone else said, It's difficult to come back from a one-two like this. Ghost in the Shell was a mistake, but coupled with this it's turning into a trend of problematic choices, either on her part or on the parts of her agents.

HOWEVER, no one will get anywhere by just lambasting Scarlett with hate. Everyone's so quick to jump on a ""fallen hero"" these days and write them off as being Horrible People Forever that the idea of coming back from something like this, of forgiveness and redemption, hell, just of being the bigger person, doesn't seem to occur to a lot of people.

I want to be clear: People have a right to be angry. People have a right to be disgusted, and yes, even a right to write ScarJo off if they feel the need to. But be aware that doing that a door, once closed, is very difficult to open again. Just ask George Takei.

The fact that she bowed out of this role is what feels important to me. Whether because she knew it was a bad career decision, or because it was the right thing to do, this movie will not be made with her in it. I'm not saying we have to all go back to adoring her, we really don't, but we got what we wanted.

"I was incredibly disappointed in Johansson's initial response. And the fact that this came after all the backlash over Ghost in the Shell makes it clear that she doesn't really care. On the bigger issue of cis actors playing trans characters, my biggest problem with it, speaking as a trans woman, is not so much with a cis actor playing a trans part, but the constant misgendering when Hollywood does this. I would have much less of a problem if they had cast a cis male actor to play this part. The message Hollywood continues to send with their casting of trans characters is that trans people are really the gender they were assigned at birth, and that we're just ""acting"" like we're a different gender. In other words, Hollywood is telling the straight community that we're fake. This attitude is actually dangerous to trans people. Taking jobs away from trans actors is certainly a problem, but there's a more fundamental problem with this whole thing.",0,0,2018-07-17T04:02:26.000Z,Monkeyflower,UCKWA5sFnHWVpNGplVCff8bg,oUURMZiMVcA,True,UgwydwomYgPi34BeJNJ4AaABAg

I think artistic integrity is more important than forced representation. Neither you or I want trans actors to get pigeonholed), and just Hollywood banking on a big star to make it a big movie, but using other examples of people in her situation as if they didn't get any backlash is so inane.

"What I got from your explanation is that you liked Man of Steel because you're biased towards liking Superman.
As someone who didn't grow up with Superman and is pretty indifferent towards the character I don't care if Superman acted like ""Superman"" or followed some moral code. 
What I hated about the movie was the structure. It basically had none. It was just a bunch of random scenes sewn together however they wanted it to. Like the makers of the movie sat around and came up with ""cool scenes"", like ""wouldn't it be funny if Superman f-ed up an a-hole's truck and the dude was just like 'what the fuck?'"" or ""It would be so epic if a bunch of oil workers saw Superman lift up the whole rig to save them!"" and then they had to awkwardly mash the pieces together to make some kind of movie. 
Any kind of theme or philosophy was just implied heavy-handedly and never dealt with in any real way, like the whole Jesus metaphor, while the emergence of a moral code for Superman, which you spoke about in your video, went completely under the radar. Watching this movie I did not realise Superman had any injunction against killing and it wasn't really clear why he was so upset after killing Zod (Sorry if I remember the name wrong) since he clearly had loads of other options (which might just be because of bad filmmaking) and had inevitably caused the deaths of hundreds of people through the destruction of the city, which he didn't seem to spare a thought to. One didn't get the sense that he was particularly worried about the alien race or being the only one of his kind, he seemed pretty much set against the other aliens from the beginning, so without it being hinted at or implied it is nothing but a guess in the wind that he's upset about potentially killing the last of his race (especially when he really didn't have to).
You talk about how this might be how he developed his guidelines against fighting in populated areas or killing people, but since I don't have any idea that this is part of his character I have no reason to think this experience taught him anything of the sort, since he seems basically unchanged from the beginning of the movie in the end. He did not seem either flippant or worried about human life before the experience, and I saw nothing to indicate that he felt any other way once the film had concluded, so this is something a person must simply speculate based on their knowledge of the character from other sources. 
Maybe if one knows a lot about the historical canon into which one can put the movie in context, this could be enjoyable (One thing I've noticed is that those that are defending the movie on the internet seem to be fans of Superman in general) but the movie does not stand on it's own, especially not as the first in a major movie franchise.

That said, because of how invested I am in the characters, the lore, the dinosaurs, etc. (especially Blue and Rexy), I didn't at all mind the cliffhanger setup the film provided.

That all said, movie 4 had cooler action scenes, a more memorable ending, better use of both Rexy and Blue, the I-Rex was way scarier and cooler than the I-Raptor, and ultimately it is because of movie 4 that I loved movie 5 as much as I did.

"""You don't do the right thing because it's in your best interests to do so; you do it...because it's the right thing to do"" - Words for everyone to live by.

As for the topic of conversation itself, I pretty much just stayed out of it for the same reason I do for most casting outrage controversies; that being that I personally don't care who plays what for the most part, so long as the acting is solid and the portrayal is accurate and respectful towards whatever/whoever the actor is trying to portray.

Don't get me wrong; I fully understand why people get mad at these decisions - representation does matter, and if you're going to represent something, you may as well actually bring a person from the community you're representing aboard to play that role to the best of their ability (representation through media coverage due to the obtained celebrity status of someone who is actually from that community is undoubtedly helpful as well), but I'm personally fine with them choosing someone outside of that specific community...so long as the project has various consultants from that community (who'll ensure that the end product doesn't accidentally reinforce stereotypes despite it's well-intentioned goals) and the actor/actress does their own independent research to develop a personal connection to that community, despite technically not being a part of it. 

Of course, even this has its limits. The Hellboy/GITS outrages were fully justified in that race isn't a man-made societal construct like gender is (the differences between gender and sex are a whole other discussion that can be saved for another time), and the historical context of white people playing non-white roles makes even trying to justify the idea of white-washing very difficult and honestly quite stupid (the only exception being The Ancient One in the MCU due to the threat of Chinese censorship and the gender-swap lessening the white-wash blow slightly, and even that's very sketchy depending on your POV), so it's just more logical and respectful to just get people to play roles that match their own ethnicity and leave it at at.

At the end of the day, I just want people treated equally, and a big part of that happening is through representation in media (I live in such an obscure, white-dominant area of Britain that my only exposure to non-white people for like a decade was through the DC and Marvel comics, cartoons and movies I grew up with, alongside other shows, so yeah, giving everyone their time in the light is still very much important) that's positive, and if that happens to come from someone who doesn't represent that community in their real-world persona, I'm okay with it...again, to an extent, and under certain conditions.

"I once spoke on similar issues when it was announced that a black man was cast to play Kristoff in the Broadway adaptation of Frozen, and when ScarJo was cast to star in the remake of Ghost in the Shell. To keep it brief, while I understand why people wouldn't want her to take the role, and why her backing out seems too convenient for it to be for morality reasons, I can also understand the other side to those coins as well. ScarJo could've had a change of heart despite the convenience, and she very well could've been passionate to try to represent a trans man to the best of her abilities. If people can be cast as characters of other ethnicities and sexual orientations, whether offensive or otherwise, I don't see the problem in casting a woman to portray a trans man, especially seeing as the film adaptation will most likely take creative liberties in telling the story it's based on either way.

But at the same time this niche audience this film is aiming at will of course be insulted by casting a woman in a trans-man role.
Do I think that ScarJo would have ruined the film? Probably not. I would have loved to see her try this role and push her limits. But I think taking this role away from trans-men who so rarely get the spotlight anyway, was just insensitive.

Seeing that ScarJo was involved in the Ghost in the Shell live action film which had similar backlash because she took a role for an Asian character while being white as heck it seems that she didn't learn from this or the backlash wasn't big enough.",2,3,2018-07-16T16:38:32.000Z,MelvaCross,UCGOF6l8kBRgyeFe4RYSblCQ,oUURMZiMVcA,True,Ugy538JliXF9AnPcRy14AaABAg

"I know this may seem like quite a cynical perspective, but you'll probably find that, like most actors, Johansson didn't really get a say in what her defense would be...if that makes sense.
Like, her actions were probably planned out by an agent or manager of hers. Actions that they decided would mitigate any negative backlash, while also allowing her to get the part (and her agents, their money), but after realising that committing to Rub & Tug would not benefit them in the long term (publicly or financially), they pulled her out.
Like I said, it's a cynical view to have, but it's possible.

"I always thought that the monster crush phenomenon worked for a couple of reasons:
1) The focus on ""inner beauty"" rather than ""physical attractiveness"" means that a lot of emphasis is put on building the character rather than their appearance. I'd take a well-rounded monster over a flat piece of eye candy any day.
2) Monster don't need to adher to human beauty standards, and thus they override them. Countless times movies and other medias expect us (or out right tells us) to find a certain character attractive, yet I can't help but roll my eyes. Monsters aren't expected to be beautiful, and don't line up with the standard ""grading"" of attractiveness. We can either accept or reject a human's physical attractiveness immediately, but monsters are just so odd that there's no clear rules or obvious markers for what can be considered attractive to a human mind.

It's for these reasons that when I choose a character to romance in the Mass Effect trilogy, I always pick Garrus over Kaiden. Kaiden's appearance, while traditional attractive, I found so bland and unimpressive that I felt like was staring at a brick wall. Garrus' appearance is extremely alien, with interesting physical details and armour designs that always feels new every time I talk to him. And while Kaiden has some history and depth to his character, there is no way he can compare to Garrus. Garrus, the badass alien cop that doesn't play by the rules. It also helps that Garrus one of the few characters that stays loyal to the PC throughout the series no matter what happens. 

As for why which monster ""types"" are considered more attractive than other monsters... That's another conversation for another time.

"favorites (in no particular order bc they have different strengths and weaknesses to them):
 1. Shirokuma's Cafe (aka Polar Bear's Cafe)
2. Full Metal Alchemist (i liked both the first adaptation and brotherhood)
3. Mob Psycho 100
4. Baccano!
5.Cowboy Bebop
6. Mushishi


Thoughts - Shirokuma and Mushishi are very theraputic shows for me, shirokuma bc is so lighthearted and funny, mushi bc its like... just relaxing vibes?? like if u dont have room for a polar bear who runs a cafe and a panda that works part time at a zoo idk what to tell you.  idk if i can do justice to mushi bc its like one of those shows u just have to experience it. like i dont think i could do justice to describe a ghibli movie thats kind of the same way idk how to describe mushi. 

mob 100 is definately the one of this list that has made me FEEL the most like... holy shit. this is one of the first animes that made me cry for a long time.i was a fan of OPM bc the the animation and humor but mob rly takes things i loved from that show and take it to a new level.  

cowboy bebob like yeah p much not much else has to be said about that.  i also enjoyed sammurai champloo but not as much.

baccano was great for me bc ive always been fond of mobster movies and comics like goodfellas and lackadaisy, like if ur into that you will not be disappointed with this. 

fma i think its good to watch both versions and not get too ate up with which one is ""better"". i personally think certain emotional beats/story arcs hit me more in the first one that brotherhood didnt have the same impact on me.  the animation in brotherhood seems to be higher quality and its more accurate to the manga. 

honorable mentions:

watch cardcaptor sakura and then madoka to give urself whiplash lmao

durara! and ginga desu weed(and its predecessor ginga nagareboshi gin) are both shows i remember liking when i watched them but dont particularily remember now... i would like to rewatch them again at some point. if youre a fan of stories with animal protagonists like(warrior cats or white fang)  then GDW might be up your alley. durara i remember was about gang wars or something? 

keroro gunso (aka sgt frog) was another show i used to be super into in high school, its a super fun and goofy show but has a lot weird humor that went over my head when i first watched it. its way too long to watch the whole thing (like 200 or so episodes in i gave up) but i think its worth watching up until the point where they have the battle with their rival platoon (and skipping any filler episodes that aren't that good). i haven't watched the reboot with shin keroro but ive been meaning too.

"It's interesting how alike yet different we are. Also I am 36. YOU'LL GET THERE.

My top 5 anime series in no particular order:

*Yuri!!! On Ice: This is the only non-Magical Girl show on my top list right now, though that may change over time. If you've seen it, you can probaly guess why I like it. I am a fan of figure skating, and the interpersonal dynamics, sense of humor, and genuine pathos the characters generated hooked me even harder than the gay stuff. Though it was nice to see a world without homophobia. That's way rarer than I'd like it to be. Also, the OP and EP are terrific.

*Cardcaptor Sakura: There is just something so charming about this show. Not much actually happens for most of the episodes, it's just a lot of slice-of-life stuff, but it's really GOOD slice-of-life stuff. Great voice cast, beautiful effects, and just an upbeat, chill vibe for most of the series. However, it knew when to get seriousm and I absolutely got sucked in when that happened. The same holds true for this year's continuation, Clear Card-hen, but it ended way too soon, and I don't know if they're making a second season.

*Revolutionary Girl Utena: I watched the movie first. NEVER WATCH THE MOVIE FIRST. It took me over 12 years to get up the courage to watch this show in its entirety, but I'm so, SO glad I did, because it is amazing and thought-provoking, and challenging in all the good ways, especially for a show from 1999/2000. (yes, I count it as a Magical Girl show)

*Puella Magi Madoka Magica: For someone who likes Magical Girl anime as much as I do, you'd think a deconstruction would offend or traumatize me. And yeah, there were parts of it that did do just that. HOWEVER, this show did such a good job with everything: the symbolism, the magic, the awesome music, that it's compelling despite being so dark. A good way to get me to at least sit up and take notice of your anime is to make good use of Yuki Kajiura and/or her band, Kalafina, for your music. ""Credens Justitiam"" is still one of my all time favorite songs, not just in anime, but period.

*Sailor Moon: Yeah, I'm THAT gay. It took me a long time to get into this show, largely because of the Godawful DiC and Cloverway dubs. But when I saw the complete Japanese version, and its incredible ViZ Media dubbing (a good English dub is hard to find, but this one's almost as good as the original Japanese cast),  I was hooked, and I never looked back. For the record, I also like Sailor Moon Crystal, but Season 3 is DEFINITELY better than the first two.

Honorable mentions go to Little Witch Academia, Fullmetal Alchemist (2003, as I've not seen Brotherhood), Slayers, Ouran High School Host Club, and X/1999, all of which are amazing and touched me in some way or other (notlikethat) over the course of my life.",0,0,2018-06-28T18:38:28.000Z,Curt Clark,UCKbSfs4iIfKw3i6EgrS5Ivg,59dYHupLs-Q,True,Ugw8qm7TkQKFiRX4U-d4AaABAg

Sailor Moon (the 90's run for nostalgia reasons, the 20th anniversary version for the anime that we should have gotten in the 90's)
Revolutionary Girl Utena (Beautifully layered metaphor over allegory over more metaphor over some of the most wonderfully written friendship and romance between two women)
Magnetic Rose (a short found in the anthology Memories, it's Phantom of the Opera to the most gloriously twisted degree. Actually, just check out the whole anthology)
Aggretsuko (Because who doesn't want a super cute personification of every late 20 or early 30 something's feelings about the working world right now)

"I thought it was a fun film with lovable characters, that is until the ending. And that ending ruined the whole film for me. To be honest I'm not sure if they were trying to send out an animal rights message or if the decision they had one of the characters made at the end (I'm hoping you know what I meant without being spoiler-y) is just a sequel hook for the next film. I mean when that character did that thing at the end I was like ""NO! NO! NONONONONONO!!!!!!"" I understand the person's feelings for doing that but not only was it selfish, but extremely dangerous. Especially since they gone through the same experience. I figured they would have understood the consequences of what their actions would cause.
However at the same time they played the Jeff Goldblum speech at the end so maybe they are acknowledging that the decision was wrong, it's just that now people are going to have to ""deal with it"". Thus the story for the next film.

I don't know. Do you thing they were sending out an animal rights message? While I agree on certain things like wild animals shouldn't be used for entertainment at all, I'm more for animal welfare.

"1) I miss Fable too.

2) I am of BOTH minds when it comes to the Fox/Disney deal. The rights to the Fantastic Four and the X-Men back with Marvel means an end to the embargo on all things X in and out of the comics (which, YES, thank you Goddess!), and hopefully that could portend some new shows, new movies that actually let themselves be superhero movies, new merch, and that's a HUGE pro to someone like me...

3)...but Disney ARE becoming a bit of an evil empire. To put it mildly. If they were made to let go of some things in order to keep the X-Men and Fantastic Four, like, say, the Simpsons, or the Aliens and Predator franchises, or things that just don't fit their label, I'd feel a little more comfortable.

"""Doing the lord's work."" <3 <3 
I think I'm definitely open to live action Gargoyles. And I'm certainly open to Jordan Peele directing... and maybe having a smaller role (cough cough Broadway) a la Taika Waititi as Korg. 
What I don't think I want (though I can probably be convinced otherwise) is it to be a film. One of the things I loved about the series was how semi-serialized it was. It was really good at maintaining its continuity, borrowing from world folklore and mythologies, Xanatos slow-burning plans, and Demona's long and tragic backstory that dovetails into MacBeth and the Hunters. They did all those great elements of modern serialized television while still mostly maintaining a 23-minute episodic structure that on the one hand I worry that all that careful long-term planting and payoff that the series had would be lost or dumbed down in a 90-130 minute film. Whereas, in the age of prestige television, I think with a decent enough budget, a live action Gargoyles television show would be kind of incredible. Of course, knowing my luck it would end up on Hulu and not Netflix and I'd be forced to finally switch.

"I would like to point out that Tron's ""questionable"" resurgence was further boosted in Kingdom Hearts 3D (Dream Drop Distance) and even prompted Disney to release an animated series in the form of Tron: Uprising which in my honest opinion should have been a whole lotta NOPE. But the reason it worked for them was  not only because of a legendary cast of voice actors like Elijah Wood and Mandy Moore as Beck and Mara respectively, but because of  Executive Producer Charlie Bean's precise placement of where to mix the old elements of Tron with more modern aspects of life, since the show isn't based on Tron Legacy but in between the original Tron and Legacy in a more modern era. That being said, Disney is no stranger to playing the waiting game in regards to people from the outside trying to get in as it were. 
     
     I personally would love to see a live action gargoyles Movie or even a CG resurgence of the original animated series like Tron Legacy got. because honestly La'ron you're not the only one that came across it late sadly and growing up in NJ as a child of the 90s, i didn't have many opportunities afford to me when i could sit down and just throw on Toon Disney or the Disney channel, except when i was at my grandmothers place. If Jordan Peele is granted an opportunity i'm interested to see where he goes with it. My main hope is that it affords me an opportunity to write HudsonXGoliath fan fiction again lol JK 
        
     But i legit hope that if this DOES get a chance and it DOES work(and it should in the right hands) that it GETS the same treatment of a animated series like Tron did because a lot of the kids i know(family) don't even know who the Gargoyles are now that i think about it, and it'd be a great chance to educated them in the story of 5 winged stoned guardians who watch over New York's Night Life and assist the new york police department with doing their job better than they can before the sun comes up.",0,0,2018-06-18T19:29:07.000Z,The Gaming Malamutt,UC5chbStiTuzNMUNXc3NgFoQ,nlCpfqp1Be0,True,Ugw2NqE1E--th5b5UGh4AaABAg

I see Jordan as such a Fanboy that he just might do as you say, because like all of us Gargoyles fans, he wants to see a good live action version of it mad.

He could also go the route that Del Toro did with ""Shape of Water"", where he had pitched it as an 'official' Creature from the Black Lagoon remake, but when they turned it down, he sanded off the 'trademarks' and made it something original (that won Frakkin' BEST PICTURE, so I'm guessing some Universal Execs. are continually kicking themselves now ^_^).

He would have to work hard, though, to make the creatures original enough to avoid copyright (I recall ""I, Frankenstein"" having a clan of ""Good Gargoyles"", but they had feathered wings for one thing, and could assume human form when they wanted [saving on CGI, I'm certain]).",0,0,2018-06-18T17:27:33.000Z,Chup Smith,UC3UxAFZPz0-nKg8EvfrYKxA,nlCpfqp1Be0,True,Ugyh1GcJde-kIt-eEDN4AaABAg

"Why it gotta be live action, tho? *headtilt*

I am UNNATURALLY protective of Weisman properties, and Gargoyles is the reason why.

As someone who LOVES the original two seasons of the show, and owns it all on DVD, I LOATHED the Goliath Chronicles. A downgrade in animation, writing quality, some incredibly weak story twists, characters that fell flat after two seasons of dynamic development (oh, poor Fox, what did they DO to you?!) (Fox the character, not Fox the network)...the voice acting was the only real strength that remained from the old show.

And Weisman, past the first episode of The Goliath Chronicles, was not involved at all.

Conversely, W.I.T.C.H. was a show in the late 00s that started off reasonably okay, but when Weisman was brought on board, the show SKYROCKETED in quality, becoming deeper, funnier, more thoughtful, and just fascinating in general. 

Spectacular Spider-Man, Young Justice, season 1 of Star Wars Rebels...Weisman has done a lot of wonderful things for animation.

Now, I haven't seen Get Out, so I don't know much about Jordan Peele as a director, but I've HEARD incredible things. So this doesn't feel like any more of a gamble, from a money-making perspective, than the live-action Jungle Book...or upcoming Dumbo...actually, you know what? this sounds like LESS of a gamble than that.

From a storytelling perspective...Weisman needs to be brought on, at least as a creative consultant. The Gargoyles franchise is his baby, and I've seen how it can suffer in his absence.

Also also, GET KEITH DAVID ON THE HORN ASAP. There can only be one voice for Goliath. ONLY ONE.",4,1,2018-06-18T17:09:51.000Z,Curt Clark,UCKbSfs4iIfKw3i6EgrS5Ivg,nlCpfqp1Be0,True,Ugz9I1WmQN80pHdh5aF4AaABAg

Unfortunately, the reboot movies Focus on the three main characters, rather than the entire cast.this is of course a problem in and of itself, but one which is hard to escape when all the existence of your universe  is three action movies. Character development has never really been nearly as focused on in these films as it could perhaps have been.

"I want to preface this statement(albeit roughly two years after this was posted) that I am a millennial. Listening to this video NOW probably benefits me way more then it likely would have if i had come across it in 2016. Simply because it wasn't until January of this year i learned that i am a millennial.  
I think everyone that wasn't named HUCK made some valid points in their arguments. Joshua's points about the ability to take out student loans and starting businesses back in the days of the baby boomer generation being a bit more difficult than it is now is FAIR. I wont say its wrong or right but its FAIR. Back in the early 70s, 60s or earlier, banks couldn't just type a few keys and instantly pull up your credit history so that you could get the loans you needed to attend school. More often than not, you had to go through MONTHS of screening just to be considered for a loan(at least according to my grandmama) and i know of some baby boomers that are still paying off those loans to this day. 
Winston also makes an excellent point by saying that the reason that baby boomers dislike millennial's so much is because they are aware that change is coming and they dont want to hand over the reigns without a fight. I'm personally of the opinion that Change is a double edged blade. it can be good or bad depending on the direction it leads and who's leading the charge. I type this as Donald Trump is closing a peace summit with North Korea. Something that hasn't been able to be accomplished in DECADES because no one has made it a point to even try(doesn't change that i still don't like the fucker). 
Baby Boomers like to complain that Millennial's are ruining the economy by not taking the world as THEY left it when in truth they didn't leave us much to begin with. 
Millennial's make it a point to complain about how shit the job market is because of the baby boomer generation basically REMOVING Full time from simple jobs like Pathmark and Wal-mart, when in truth a lot of us are just to lazy(or entitled) to go out looking for work at all. 

I think its FAIR to say that both sides have some work to do in terms of just accepting that all in all, we're all in this fucked up world together. I think that instead of one side complaining about the other, we should find a way to come together and make the world an easier place for us all to co-exist.

"I feel like doing this in mid-2018 is cheating, but here we go:

5) Thor: Ragnarok. I can hear La'Ron shouting ""BETA RAY BILL"" in the back of my head as I'm typing this, but I feel it's wrong to judge these movies for what WASN'T there, so much as for what WAS. And what was there was...aight. Better than aight, it was fun, and sad, and full of camaraderie, and enjoyable on many levels. While she wasn't given much to do, Hela was an interesting character with a lot of implications in her backstory. While I'm still not over the deaths of the Warirors Three, I GREATLY enjoyed the dynamics between Thor and Hulk and Thor and Banner, and how distinct but truly equal the two friendships were. Thor and Strange will always be my favorite Odd Couple, even more so than Strange and Tony Stark in IW. Meanwhile, the Thor/Loki dynamic, which was the chief strength of The Dark World (yeah, I said it) was in full force here and, if Infinity War is any indication, was a terrific send-off to this amazing duo. Plus, naked Hulk. Because...come on.

4) Captain America: The First Avenger. I am not a patriot by any stretch of the imagination, but seeing the kid from Brooklyn turn into Marvel's most unambiguously heroic character continues to evoke a special feeling for me. Red Skull was a terrific villain who got seriously shafted (until Infinity War), and the whole 'adventure/war movie' vibe still makes me as nostalgic for Indy as it does La'Ron. Winter Soldier was a better STORY, but First Avenger was a better MOVIE, almost Spielbergian in its classic, nostalgic feel.

3) The Avengers (2012). While Age of Ultron gave us the better lineup, with Vision, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, and Quicksilver added to the ranks, and Infinity War brought Strange, Bucky, Spidey, and Black Panther into the mix, thus making it the *perfect* roster (sans Hawkeye, but I think I'm the only person who thinks that), the first Avengers movie had a good balance of characters, with excellent group dynamics and fantastic banter & action. I dare you to watch the movie up until that first classic spinning shot of the lineup preparing for battle and NOT feel elated when they all come together - Assemble, if you will. To this day, 6 years later, it feels like the culmination of years of effort and planning, and remains one of the highlights of the MCU for me.

2) Doctor Strange. I voted this one above Avengers because it corrects a serious problem with the MCU up till then: Magic. It was in Doctor Strange that magic was finally called magic, that sorcery was acknowledged for what it is and mysticism and the occult were finally recognized as a legitimate form of superpower in the MCU. In addition, it's just a damn good movie, with a terrific, almost Stephen King-feeling first half about a man losing everything, and the beautifully trippy visuals really make me happy that special effects have come so far since the LAST attempt at a Doctor Strange movie back in the 70s. Also, Benedict Cumberbatch is an INCREDIBLE Stephen Strange, really losing himself in the role. I actually forget I'm watching the guy who played Sherlock when I watch this movie. Wong is a joy to watch, and Mordo is fascinating, far more tragic and deeper than he has ever been while still remaining a threat. And even with the casting controversy, Tilda Swinton is still INCREDIBLE in the role she's in.

1) Black Panther. I am far too white to say it, but I'm gonna anyway: ""WAKANDA FOREVER!"" The MCU's most effortlessly beautiful movie, with an AMAZING cast, full of life and energy, with stellar costume designs and great dynamics with everyone. Okoye and Nakia are fascinating, awesome characters (I will never, EVER not love Okoye), and I was practically dying of laughter whenever Shuri was on screen; her character's energy and utter joy is infectious. Angela Bassett as the Queen Mother is amazingly regal, and Winston Duke's M'Baku is FAR deeper, more interesting, and more entertaining than his comic book counterpart. And of course, Chadwick Boseman pulls off the title role brilliantly, with more humor and pathos than I've ever seen T'Challa display in my life. I could actually ship this version of the Black Panther with Storm if she ever shows up in the MCU. Black Panther wasn't just the most important superhero movie in the last decade, it was also one of the best, and easily my favorite film thus far in the MCU.",0,0,2018-06-13T18:00:10.000Z,Curt Clark,UCKbSfs4iIfKw3i6EgrS5Ivg,9gkq2PKIqaA,True,UgwNNzO7ikqNivwWQsB4AaABAg

"Two and a half years and no comments? Seriously? Like, for srs?

OK, I'll go first.

My favorite interpretation of this story is the 1999 TNT made-for-TV movie starring Patrick Stewart. It adheres to the source material, even adding authenticity by including period-appropriate song and dance numbers, it has a cast of B-list (in terms of fame, not talent) character actors who are incredibly well-suited for their roles, and Patrick Stewart, like with Jean-Luc Picard, like with Charles Xavier, is IMO the BEST choice for Ebenezer Scrooge, largley I feel due to his experience on stage in a one-man performance of it.

In addition, the story is handled very, VERY well in this version. All the important plot beats are there, butt it manages to take the story from being a not-that-scary attempt at a scary story to a deeply personal journey of reprobation, remorse, regret, and redemption (YAY alliteration!). The point of Scrooge's journey in the Stewart version isn't just that he gets better by being ""scared straight"", he learns the value of kindness and goodwill through remembering it for himself and seeing it in others. The 'Past' scene at Fezziwig's is so long because it's reminding him of one of the important lessons - that his life DID use to be fulled with laughter, joy, and celebration, and that the season USED to be a time of merriment for him just like it is now for everyone else. The 'Present' scene shows him that no matter their circumstances, the holiday can bring hope to people, from prisoners to storm-tossed sailors to improverished clerks with huge families to support. The only 'scary' part is the bleak, relatively joyless 'Future' scenes, and that's supposed to be such in order to show Scrooge how important it is that he change while he can.

On to the Ghosts question: To me, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come is the most powerful, not by virtue of raw ability (that's Present), but because he/she/they can change the course of events by showing what an unaltered future will look like. Showing the right visions to the right people can go a long way, and I know a LOT of people in power right now who could use a good Christmas Future-ing. Then again I've been an X-Men nerd for over 25 years, and know the power of time travel, AND how a seemingly-innocuous power can be turned to amazing effect. (see also: Kitty Pryde, Destiny, Cypher, Danielle Moonstar)

Lastly, black and white movies: I STRONGLY recommend The Ghost & Mrs. Muir if you've not already seen it. It is a sorely underappreciated, deeply emotional classic, and one of my favorite films of all time.",0,0,2018-06-13T17:16:48.000Z,Curt Clark,UCKbSfs4iIfKw3i6EgrS5Ivg,pqJ74PiaaBs,True,UgwC7t2nkM8Bpg7Yj854AaABAg

"La'Ron...you asked for this.

I have two tiers of fictional crushes: the guys whom I admire and aspire to emulate, and the guys who OH MY GOD GET OUT OF THE PAGE/OFF THE SCREEN AND INTO MY BED, NOW.

Tier 1 (the role models):

MCU Captain America
MCU Black Panther
Colossus
Nightcrawler
Rawhide Kid (2003 version)
David Xanatos
Jean-Luc Picard
Silverbolt (Beast Wars)
Wiccan (Young Avengers)
DCAU Superman
DCAU Captain Marvel/Shazam
YJ Aqualad
Han Solo/Indiana Jones (they're basically the same person, right?)

Tier 2 (the 'there-is-no-SFW-way-to-describe-my-feelings-for-these-characters' dudes):

Beast (Disney)
Goliath
MCU Thor
Wolverine (classic version)
John Constantine
Nightwing (pretty sure he's mandatory if you're into dudes)
Beast (X-Men, circa 1975-2000)
Hulkling
Kimahri (FFX)
Gladiolus (FFXV)
the core trio of Supernatural (I'm not proud)
Any character played by David Boreanaz
Tigatron/Tigerhawk (Beast Wars; I'm aware there's no logical way to make this work and I DO NOT CARE.)

"I think for me the first monster I was attracted to was not literally a monster per se, but more of a villain - Poison Ivy. She's kinda framed as a monster sometimes, like she's not entirely human but rather part human, part plant. And in the comics, she turned out to be canonically queer (to my inner closeted child's delight). And I think it's interesting that in earlier portrayals of Poison Ivy, she was depicted as an irredeemable villain, and now she's a sympathetic kinda chaotic neutral character who has her own story arc and shows personal growth.

Then there was my vampire phase, which came before Twilight (thank the gods), starting with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I related to Buffy herself having a secret identity (similar to most superheroes), and I related to the vampires who were supposedly ""damned"" and were harmed by holy symbols and unable to come into the light for fear of being burned - and thus being relegated to the shadows or any underground, hidden from the rest of humanity. This definitely feels like a metaphor for queerness to me.

That's a theme that pretty much exists in all vampire fiction - certainly Carmilla, of course, and Dracula stories to a lesser extent, and definitely in Anne Rice's ""Interview"" and subsequent stories. True Blood took it to a greater extreme, which I loved, not only with canonically queer characters but subtext so unsubtle it's pretty much text (using the phrase ""coming out of the coffin"" comes to mind).",0,0,2018-06-11T22:50:17.000Z,futilethewinds,UCKcjVSMCEX2IMmbW3WDUjpw,ERrVNKEQJA8,True,UgzmoxSaZ66sxRRtsNB4AaABAg

"Elder Scrolls VI. Yeah, I'm THAT guy. Sorry.

But seriously, CD Projekt Red did a wonderful job with Witcher 3, even if I can't actually play it with any sort of skill. Go off the beaten path and you're in 'Dark Souls hard' territory without serious over-leveling, and I am TERRIBAD at staying on the beaten path. So Cyberpunk 2077 Looks and SOUNDS incrediballs...whenever we get to play it.

As for KH3...I am more concerned about whether or not I'll be able to follow the PLOT of the bitch as opposed to how long it's taking. I have not played Birth By Sleep, 358/2 Days, Dreap Drop Distance, Kingdom Candy Crush, or any of the $#!+-billion OTHER spinoffs, sequels, or pseudo-sequels that have come out since KH2. I know I could just watch the cutscene videos on YouTube, but I don't want to HAVE to.  If KH3 includes nods to these games that DON'T require an inordinate amount of research to understand (or, better yet, if Jiminy's Journal actually throws us a bone with some references and shit), I'll be happy. Otherwise...HARD pass. I am not a big enough fan of this franchise to gorge myself on continuity porn like it's freaking Estus.

"Ok, how about you not use the fact that you personally didn't like it as an excuse to shit on the actual fans with that ""Thundercats was never good"" nonsense? Also ""nobody watched the 2011 reboot"" is a blatant lie created by Cartooon Network themselves to justify dumping it in favor of Legends of Chima. Funny how everybody who attempts to defend this nonsense hides behind the same 4 excuses: Thundercats was never good. Thundercats was always stupid. You hate change so you automatically hate this. You just hate the new redesigns because they aren't sexualized anymore. I'll debunk all those bogus arguments. If Thundercats was only good as background noise and nothing else, what, pray tell, were you so fascinated with back then? Because I can guarantee you somebody made the exact same ""never good"" argument about that too. Are you a child of the 80s? Your statement makes it sound like you are. You do realize someone's made that ""XYZ was never good"" argument about everything from He-Man to Thundercats to G. I. Joe to Transformers to Jem to My Little Pony to Inspector Gadget to the Centurions to
the Littles to Alvin and the Chipmunks to Garfield & Friends to Muppet Babies by now, right? Thundercats was only stupid if it didn't appeal to you. I can guarantee you people are totally saying hatever you were into is stupid as well. The issue with change has nothing to do with change itself. Change is good, but all change isn't good. As a fan of Thundercats and Teen Titans and even Ben 10, PPG and Scooby Doo, you might not want to accept this, but these aren't reboots, they're parodies. And that is the real problem with change. When you don't really change something, but turn into a parodical shell of it's former self. Also for the art style and character design, fans don't hate it cuz it's not sexualized or cuz it's cutesy, we hate it because they look like trash, barely look anything like people and every reboot doesn't need to be turned into fucking Americanized Crayon Shin-Chan smh how is that so hard to understand? Seriously, bad reboots are bad reboots. Every franchise has at least one shitty reboot under it's belt, if it's lucky enough to even get rebooted. Remember Ninja Turtles The Next Mutation?

"Honestly, I kinda want them to make a Lego DC Cinematic Universe franchise. Superman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman are really easy to make work in a format akin to Lego Batman, and team movies featuring the Justice League, Justice Society of America and the Titans could work to. Green Lantern, Flash and Martian Manhunter are all...complicated. 

As much as I love J'onn, I know all too well that his history is a mess. Yes, GL, WW and Aquaman had these issues as well, but you at least had a firm leg to stand on with all three in terms of a basic personality profile (or profiles for the GLs), abilities and a supporting cast. J'onn has none of that beyond the personality, and that strongly relies on him bouncing off the rest of the League to be really effective. His power-set was notoriously inconsistent across everything he showed up in, and whatever cast he built up would be lost within five years. Hell, DC can't even decide if they prefer his backstory to be ""last of his kind"" or ""one of many of his kind but trapped on Earth...for some reason"". As such, there's not much material for a solo Lego film about him. A solo DCEU film? Yes, but not a Lego film.

With Flash, there'd be two priorities; 1) Use the Flash-Family. All of them. This includes the CW Flash-Family members Vibe, Firestorm, Frost and Harry Wells as people who he views as a part of the family despite them not being speedsters. This needs to be done because a Lego Flash movie should be the biggest celebration of Legacy ever. When I think of Legacy in comic books, the Flash mantle is what I think of, and it should be what the general public thinks of first as well. Secondly, embrace the Rogues. Not just that team, but also Grodd (Silver Age Telekinesis and all), Zoom, Prof. Zoom, Rival, Godspeed, Savitar, Lady Savitar, Inertia (and all the ""How many evil speedsters are there?!"" jokes that come with them), Thinker (both Cliffords DeVoe and Carmichael), Fiddler, Rag Doll, Shade, Peek-A-Boo, Plunder, Griffin, Fallout, Girder, Magenta, Blacksmith and Cicada. Of course, this would end in a huge, utterly ridiculous and cheesy fight scene at the end that embraces it's own lunacy. This seems like the recipe for some sort of wonderfully insane, wierd Silver Age film that would be truly great if done by the right people. The problem is that I'm not sure modern audiences are ready for something this insane yet, at least not with Flash. Batman and Superman work in this context because everyone has known them for decades, while Flash is mostly an icon of the 21st century for the general public thanks to the DCEU, DCAU and Arrowverse. I, and many comic fans like me, would love it, but it feels like the type of thing a studio like WB would laugh off and dismiss without thinking about it.

Green Lantern should be easy, and in many ways it is, but there's a big problem with making another Green Lantern movie; the 2011 movie's bitter ass taste has yet to leave us. Personally, I want to say that we should wait until the DCEU version comes out, but considering that franchise's record so far, I refuse to put all my Lantern Eggs in that hastily made, half-broken basket. Other than that I think it would be a solid choice, especially if we get to see a bit of Earth GL Action (just one montage of him fighting Hector Hammond, Goldface, Shark and Doctor Polaris is all I need) and Mogo, the best Living Planet there is.

Anyway, I've rambled way too much on this one. The point is that I'd like to see the Lego DC Universe grow and expand out further in the future.",0,0,2018-06-07T02:19:38.000Z,Danny Buckle,UCBArrRb2DCyLUIZMPbgNV-Q,MIrv8TBbLQs,True,UgzVALVOrkLD2iUvILF4AaABAg

"That is all me when it comes to the Robinson Wonder woman comics right now. Part I me knows I don't enjoy it, the writing is shit, wonder woman hasn't talked in ages and the art isnt compelling enough to brush it off. How ever another part of me wants to be fair because Geoff Johns created WW brother and Robinson was told the story line he writes has to resolve around him. Robinson wasn't given preparation time so part of me wants to give the guy some slack. Though more importantly I want to believe that the run can't be so bad and that there is some reason that will fix it and make it all worth it. Plus I'm sure someone out there must like it.........Though that sense of fair play is slowly suffocating.

Though I guess a more fair comparison would be my reaction to the Batman Wonder woman issue that was created amoung the 'batman is engaged to catwoman' storyline with WW and Batman separated in another dimension for years without aging with no time passing on earth. I was already a little biased against it because of its parrallels to the SupermanWW storyline with a similar premise though with slightly higher stakes with it being I think 1000 years before either them even began to crack. compared to the BTWW story which had them crack ALOT sooner. It had that annoying obvious trope where WW was used as a challenge for Batman to prove his loyality which didnt make either of them look good. and it had wasted potential in my opinion that kept nagging at me because the BT WW chemisty hadnt been built up in new 52 so this switch was not very believable. Though more importantly if BT was going to crack that soon even though people allways hype is unbreakable will they could have used it as a jumping point where wonder woman could talk to batman abpout real emotions. Or since it was cannon that Steve and Catwoman were friends for a while maybe have tention there. or dynamics like they had with the Superloiscatbat issues.
         But then came the thing were all my nitpicks and gripes took a complete halt. the ART IS SO FUCKING AMAZING I WAS TEMPTED TO BUY THE STORY MORE THAN ONCE.

"Im a fan of the old thundercats, and im dissapointed of the new thing, because it seem that it will be a mockery, making all the characters dumber, the level of humor we got from the preview like ""magic slicing stick"" and sound effects done by mouth, is... kind of low brow, specially because for sure they will do fart noices with it.
There is a few shorts that I think were directed or produced by Victor, and are not that interesing, granted the shorts are 4 years old, so maybe his sense of humor have evolved since.

I would even accept if this show was kind of like adventure time (specially because it is over, it could have fit the gap), that is trying to be funny but have an arc and a story going, and it takes some moments to be serious and deep. But with this Drawing style you know not a single thing will have an attempt to be serious, the closes thing to serious ness is how OK KO handle sad moments and development.

Alot of people claim that Thundercats animation is bad in the base show, but that isnt that true, there is alot of unique moments and use of angles and techniques, characters do little gestures to reflect their characters, and actions scenes could have some set pieces. It is good for when it was made. But, If old thundercats animation is bad, how do you call a show that use 2 frames of animation and then the characters are so deform that they are different from panel to panel.

Granted, Even if I dont like this thundercats, I would never go to tweeter or facebook to be an asshole with the creatores... well maybe a little bit, saw a tweet of a woman that work in the show, saying how exited she was because she work with so talented people, and I asked her ""Tell me that the show have not cat puns, tell me that the great and talented people know better than using cat puns"" and that probably broke her heart and dreams.",0,0,2018-05-31T17:41:39.000Z,SamuraiMotoko,UCOdCtcU52psBiEzG9U8bFBg,QpEwpzIpEr8,True,UgxplBRYXcmMidxVYIF4AaABAg

"Monsters have always been among my favorite characters in books and movies. The dynamic i am particularly obsessed with is the ""big, bad, wolf"" having moral investment to keep a seemingly innocent person safe from harm, who has a heavy reason they cannot turn elsewhere. Examples are some such as : X-men's Wolverine and Rogue, Soulsville Motorcycle Club's Lex and Abigail, and the new Alice in Wonderland's SnowCreature and Alice. One monster in particular I have not seen many people in the comments discuss is the raven from Disney's animated Sleeping Beauty and Aurora (NOT the sniveling raven man abomination in Maleficent). Like some of the examples, this pairing never gets explored in cinema, but has taken a new life in the world of self-published fanfiction. The raven is himself a servant of Maleficent, marginalized, possibly racial coded, who we see show empathy for the Prince after he is captured. Although annoying and problematic to protagonists in the plot, his resistance to the evil commands he is given demonstrate he is not like his master. Being able to fly, shift shapes, and spy undetected, he has a great amount of power but is unassuming about how he could use it to free himself (perhaps there is a curse). Fanfiction writers have fleshed out his character online, given him a name, an obsession, but mostly empathy for the young princess trapped in her small world. His character is very interesting to me because he is not a black and white character. When written well, he struggles with gray area moral decisions and even makes the wrong ones. It is through his desire to protect aurora from Maleficent that he develops into a being who is worthy of auroras love, not her love that changes him. He is a character who begins timid, integrity-less, and outcast and begins making decisions that build his character, and they're not motivated by getting Aurora to like him. She, on the other hand, has no idea of his feelings and seeks nothing more from him than physical protection from Maleficent, something he betrays while going through character development. The complexity of the raven and that he is still a monster, both Bird and Beastly in appearance as well as morally gray and somewhat untrustworthy, but wants to learn to be better and disciplines himself to change. I think he is a character that appeals to me because his character is in fact not set in stone. He is a lot like me in that once he realizes he wants to protect something, he changes all the time, trying again and again to be worthy and makes many attempts to change himself to become what he wants to be. And that goalpost for him always moves, because he learns what does and doesn't work along the way.

If you've made it this far, I hope your future is utter bliss!!!

1) it presented a lore problem with the appearance of a last minute character, creating a problem in understanding if this was set after Phantom Menace, and how long after the formation of the empire is this movie set?
2) There was a lot of effort put into building up Han and Qira's relationship, but not a lot into Han's skills. When the movie demands it, he seems to know how to operate spacecraft or being an expect card player... but we were never shown him doing so before, so it felt like the directors sprung it on us? As an audience, this is a problem as we were left wondering if he actually knows what he's doing or if he's an overconfident dingus.

"I wish this went into a little more depth, but that's because i'm an animation guy (I do written reviews) 

The objective matter of the fact is that pure action adventure shows DO NOT DO WELL ANYMORE on TV. This is why TTG and TCR is happening, because kids do not care about story-driven cartoons that they have to commit time to. Sure, they will watch and enjoy them, but with shows like TTG and TCR, the one and done episode styles are perfect for reruns and those reruns bring in views. 

Now, shows like Adventure Time and Steven Universe do amazing and are super good, but when they get story-driven, it's tough to do reruns on them, because you need to know about previous story elements. This means you can't do more reruns. 

Plus, the success of shows like TTG and hopefully TCR means that with all the revenue they make on those shows, they can then put into more story-driven shows and action shows like OK KO and the upcoming Infinity Train series. 

It's a bummer that pure action and story-driven shows don't do well anymore, but that's only on TV.

Sure, a lot of stuff I grew up on wasn't always the most intellectually stimulating, like Rocko's Modern Life or Freakazoid, but even then there were jokes and double entendres that were clever and witty and not dumbed down humor, & then there was stuff like Invader Zim and Doug that had unique themes, and ideas that made you think.

Saddened by the ""dumbing down"" appearance of TCG. Not the demo they want which is fine but, reducing a beloved classic to a cheap laughs sketch to cater to the short attention spans of current youth, is a tad disrespectful to the original material.

Like, I assume they make this a comedy series to make jokes about the original series. None of the kids will get it, they will just see it as another comedy show, bot a Thunder Cats show.

At least with Titans Go, there is a smaller gap between the original and the comedy/parody.

I feel like this show was just made to the “Nostalgia Is Kewl” bandwagon, versus reimagining/expanding thenoriginal material. After all, comedies are cheap to make, quick to write, and easy to throw out there to make kiddies giggle because “kids are stupid”.

"Honestly, my main gripe with the reboot is less with it being more lighthearted and more with the art direction that it has taken. If the show is expected to have just as much action as there is comedy like stated in an interview with the show's creator, then I don't exactly know how to feel about the art style. To me, it seems like it would be counter intuitive for demonstrating good animated action, and my fear is that it's just gonna end up being 90% comedy like other reboots such as TTG or PPG. However, with the show OK KO, which has a similar art style to it, I'm willing to hold off on completely bashing it for the art, as OK KO has shown that it's animation is great regardless of the style.
However, I do feel that the art is still very samey to a lot of the network's work, but in all honesty, I don't see it as a new issue. It's just sort of an art trend that the field of animation is taking at the moment, and when this one passes eventually, another one will oversaturate the market.
In terms of oversaturation that has become a definite issue though, I feel that's more to the genre of cartoons (being comedies) that's overtaking Cartoon Network among other companies.

"I respectfully disagree. Batman v Superman was a convoluted, overly complicated mess. It had some good moments, and there were some fantastic ideas that were poorly executed. It also had the feel of desperation to play catch up to Marvel in terms of world building. Lex Luthor and Batman had pretty much the exact same role. I feel like if you take Batman out completely and give Lex the supersuit battle with Superman, you could actually make Lex a sympathetic, if misguided villain. And you know what? Have Lex succeed. Have Lex be the one who kills Superman. Or have Batman kill Superman. Then you can set up a scene in which Lex reveals he's been manipulating events. Then you set up a character arc for Batman in which he realizes he fucked up and puts together the Justice League to ensure that supers work together rather than be divided. My point is there were so many better ways to make a dark, compelling, complicated story if only WB had the balls to do so.

Then there's the five minute scene in which they stop the movie to show trailers for the next few solo movies. Not only did it take me out of the movie, but it made no sense. Why would Batman send that to Wonder Woman? He doesn't know who the fuck she is or what her intentions or motives are. The line ""I thought she was with you"" means that Batman assumed she and Superman were working together. If you believe you need to kill someone to save the world, are you going to send random information about other random supers to someone who could be working with the person you think you need to kill on the first place?

Then there's the infamous ""Save Martha"" scene. I get what they were trying to do. They wanted to make the connection in Batman's mind of his parents' murder and make him realize that he'd fallen so far from his ideals and why he put on the cowl in the first place. But again, it was poorly executed. That scene became the catalyst for Batman to go from wanting to murder someone because he believed that person to be a threat, to being best friends? That makes Batman look like a weak minded, easily influenced character, and doesn't really make any sense. 

And then Justice League came out and pretty much retconned the entire story to fit the narrative that Superman was a beacon of hope, and when he died, so did hope. That doesn't jive with the congressional hearing scene in BvS at all. It just seems to me that WB needs to stop worrying about how far along Marvel is, and just focus on adapting the many awesome stories they have into awesome movies. They're trying too hard to world build too fast.

But that's just my opinion. I love the channel. Keep it up, man.",0,0,2018-05-20T23:58:43.000Z,George Bynum,UCbXtSnDGN0-NpCei14lJFSg,4eV5d0UhUAg,True,UgxbwPAA2aRhbEh-fRt4AaABAg

"I loved the movie. Jack black was definitely my favorite and I didn't see any commercials so a surprise jonah brother was a fun addition. I completely missed that the final boss had the same name as the boss from the last movie...so the more ya know.
    I do have to say this movie I think did leave a bit to desire when it came to the danger factor and real stakes. In the board game movie it felt like they were in real danger and if they messed up it was over but in this movie they all literally died a few times. and I know that they are teens and they figured out they had more than one life after she/Jack black was eaten by a ""rhino""....but if I was in a strange place not looking like myself I wouldn't bank of that. I wouldn't trust that something wouldn't go wrong if I died even if it seems like I'd come back. the pilot at least felt like he was genuinely scared but they at least shouldn't have treated it so simply to the point on of them pushed the other off a cliff.

         It was however fun to see a different dynamic. the Board game was good for building up dread because you didn't know what you were going to roll and it was interesting to see them try to complete the board game while avoiding all the surprises. The videogame felt a little more linear because it had a main goal(the rock going into the statue) but it had fun tropes.

       I think it would have been fun if instead of us seeing the cut scenes of van pelt if whenever there was a cut scene the group would have seen it and be unable to interact with it so we could see them be creeped out or dread Van pelt because they didn't get to see him all that much. It made sense for us to cut away to follow van pelt in the board game movie because we could see him interact with our world but also follow our heros and it was a little more unpredictable because it was in our world. But in the videogame since they are the ones experiencing the video-game and don't have the history with van pelt like rob williams, having them see the cut scenes I think might have helped the urgency.

        This does make me wonder.....while videogames are all well and good hat happens if it doesn't have a console or a tv to be plugged into? will it go back to being a Boardgame? and I don't know how I feel about it being destroyed. On one hand its satisfying but on another the whole reason people had to bury it or throw it in rivers or Oceans was because it isn't able to destroyed. So them destroying it even with cool equipment felt a big off and kind of a bummer as its always ominous that no matter what you do the game can't be destroyed and ends up being found again. it makes it a little more powerful and creepy and having it just seem to end instead of thee possibility of it continuing is kind of a bummer.

I agree with you thoughts on Kevin Heart. Everyone was super having fun though which was enjoyable to watch. I also agree that the twist of the romance with Jack Black, especially at the end with them having real impact saving that kid from the past.
      I was also interesting with the time powers with the twist that in the board-game Jamamji we follow young Rob William when he returns to their regular time and save the future so technically the two kids never play the game but Rob grew as a person.
      While in this movie we see the ending from the kids/teen's point of view. But it does bring up questions.

Also maybe try not to call the cops IN GENERAL unless there is  definite, imminent harm and danger about to happen.

"A year and change late to the arty, BUT.

My biggest concern for the sequel - assuming there actually will be one - is the casting of Tommy.

Jason David Frank is synonymous with Power Rangers. Tommy has been in the most series, with the most different Ranger powers, JDF has been the most vocally supporting and appreciative of his past as a Power Ranger, and he and Amy Jo Johnson made it into the rebooted movie. Those are some big Dragonzord prints to fill.

If they're following the series even loosely, the casting directors need to find an actor who can steal the show the same way he did. Not necessarily a STELLAR actor, because Power Rangers, but someone who can pull off the same arc, the same panache, and attract a similar fan base, selling that yes, he is the Green Ranger, and he could be a good White/Red/Red again/Black Ranger in the future.",1,0,2018-05-14T19:25:42.000Z,Curt Clark,UCKbSfs4iIfKw3i6EgrS5Ivg,tyNLvPxJyPY,True,Ugw0_s0fCDe7QFPL_st4AaABAg

"My first reaction, ""Ew, Venom? Really?""

My second reaction: ""Wait...so where is Spider-Man?""

My third reaction: ""...ugh. Pass.""

I honestly only like the Venoms insofar as they relate to Spider-Man, how they use their history with Spider-Man to either torture him or grudgingly ally themselves with him, and how that interaction affects their characterization. Trying to make Venom a solo character with NO connection to the very reason for his existence misses the entire point of Venom in the first place.

I DO find Eddie Brock the most interesting Venom, because he's the most dynamic. His journey from villain to chaotic neutral to grimdark anti-hero is interesting to me, and I say that as someone who HATES grimdark. But this movie isn't going to explore any of that, it looks like, jumping right into the ""Venom's a good guy!"" side of things while completely ignoring the leaps and bounds it took for Venom to even get there in the first place.

"ANOTHER DRAGON AGE FAN!!! :D

I've gone through five playthroughs of Dragon Age Inquisition, as a mage each time (except my dwarf playthrough because...well, obvious reasons). While I end up making a lot of the same choices (with the exception that my Qunari romanced Dorian while my human romanced Iron Bull, and I'm working on a female playthrough for Cullen because I am weak), the subtle variations are the most interesting - how the elf Inquisitor has a massive chip on their shoulder and with good reason, how the Qunari is brusque and to-the-point about their mercenary past, how the human mage is actually a snobby rich Hellfire Club motherfucker from a 1% family (and my favorite)...even these little variations make playthroughs that look identical on the surface SO INTERESTING.

I usually have at least one or two companions in every party-based RPG that, for some reason or other, I just don't like. Even in my all-time favorite RPGs, even as far back as Chrono Trigger (and I am about to engage in some blasphemy, y'all, so BUCKLE UP), when I was only lukewarm on Magus despite his backstory, because of what an utter edgelord douche he was.

Here's the list no one asked for of characters I didn't like in RPGs I enjoyed that is SURE to piss off someone!

*Chrono Trigger had Magus,

*Final Fantasy VI had Relm and Gau, VII had Cait Sith (ugh) and Yuffie (double ugh), 

*Chrono Cross had Kid and...well, half the cast really (I didn't actually like Chrono Cross all that much aside from the music), 

*Final Fantasy VII had Selphie and Squall (seriously, fuck Squall), 

*Final Fantasy X had Rikku and Tidus, 

*Final Fantasy X-2 had Rikku again, only worse, 

*Jade Empire had Silk Fox and the Black Whirlwind, 

*Dragon Age Origins had Sten and Oghren (seriously, why are the fighty types SO DULL in that game?!), 

*DA2 had Carver (I play a mage, so I didn't get to keep Bethany, which is sad because I actually LIKED her) and Sebastian...

Dragon Age Inquisition didn't have that. The only character who even got slightly irritating was Sera, and even that made sense given her character and her backstory, and balanced out by her having some legitimately funny (if lowbrow) observations and a good perspective on the whole main story. Plus, she had some terrific interactions with the entire main cast. It was also easy to come up with team configurations I liked based purely on the travel banter - my favorite party is Varric, Dorian, and the Iron Bull (<3), and they're the team I used to kill ALL the dragons. Literally. All of them died at the hands of my Inquisitor and those three party members. HASTE AND HAIL OF ARROWS, YO. At least once you get to multi-level Focus mode.

The world was huge and LOADED with stuff to do. Even the ""empty"" zones like the Hissing Wastes were pretty, in their own desolate way, and offered interesting random encounters. I know there's this kind of ""anti-open world"" mentality in gaming fans nowadays, but I don't see the problem. I really don't want to go back to purely linear, level-based gameplay in my games if we have a choice, because I TRIED to play Final Fantasy XIII and suffered immensely throughout.

I love the story, I love the side stories, I love the character arcs and interactions...I just love this game!

Other games that suck me in are Diablo 3 (people scoff, but I actually like the slightly lighter tone, brighter color palette, and the accessibility of gameplay), Oblivion and Skyrim (obviously; after I discovered mods, I wasted SO MANY HOURS of my life on that game before I had to uninstall it for the sake of my laptop and my sanity), The Sims 3 (which is a REALLY USEFUL TOOL for me as a writer trying to figure out how their characters interact with each other), KIngdoms of Amailur, Batman: Arkham City, Zelda: A Link To The Past (especially with the Randomizer ROM Hack)...

"A aspect that is rarely talked about about his character is his colonialism! Killmonger does not see himself as wakandan because he isnt ! His last line in the movie is him identifieng himself as african american and his actions in this movie are extremly black american centric but not the views of Wakandans themselfs! Wakanda is a country that has a none racial identity! What i mean by that is that Wakanda didnt do anything against colonialism and hides itself from the rest of the world including africa which to me suggests that wakandan culture does not have any kinship with the rest of africa or black people in general! 
What contradicts this slightly is theire racism against whites and i mean not that they are racist because that is perfectly in line with the values of most isolasionist cultures in history but the way they are racist towards whites! It seems weird to me that they call white people colonisers when wakanda has never been colonised . It would have been much more fiting for them to see whites as uncivilised barbarians which to me suggest that the movie itself was not written by a african but a american !

But anyway Killmonger feels entitled to wakanda even though he is culturally not wakandan and has no respect for the natives using them and theire recources as tools for his emd similar to how colonial powers used african lands for theire causes ! 
The traged of his character is that he is so blinded by racial hatred that he has become what he hates and that he just as little of a claim to the african mask than the woman he poisened .",0,0,2018-05-09T21:43:36.000Z,Mister Sister Fister,UC8WMmJN5W1OZDgQln46QbAQ,lGFFuWUkKaE,True,UgwTIxOv98n69JhASap4AaABAg
"Just saw it. One of the worst marvel's put out honestly. I don't understand the positive response to this movie. It had bad pacing, horrible characterizations, and I called the ending before even seeing the trailer for it. I knew pretty much every beat it was going to hit before it did, and nothing in it was particularly good. As far as the characters, I felt like I was watching a few of them in their first incarnations, especially Thor. It's like the Russos did away with whatever character growth he's had in the past several movies. And killing the Asgardians the way they did was not only lazy writing, it felt like an excuse to get Thor involved in a way that took the onus off the writers. It was a heavy handed move that I didn't appreciate. Thanos was...okay. I wasn't terribly impressed with him as a villain. His design is terrible. Just awful. And the whole Infinity Stones issue is...yeah, they're overpowered. But my question is, if he has this ultimate power, why should his goal be destruction when he could just...create more resources for the universe to flourish off of. So his motives don't work for me. The characters I cared the most about were underused, namely T'Challa, Cap, and Thor. I didn't buy the Wanda/Vision romance plotline, and it felt like something shoved in their to give Wanda growth or whatever. It's not like they could have just made her not want to kill her friend or anything, no they had to have them be in a romantic relationship. That trope is so tired. The plotlines were a mess and we're put together and edited together well. It jumped around way too much, which seemed inevitable due to the scale of the story. Tony was...insufferable as usual, and I hate Doctor Strange. Any time they were on screen together, it was like pulling teeth. Peter Parker had no reason to be there other than...he's a marvel character so we have to put him in there. The Guardians seemed forced into the plot, and I hated Peter Quill the entire time he was on screen. The whole machismo battle off between him and Thor in their first scene was horrible, forced, and unfunny. Speaking of the comedy, it all came at the expense of potentially emotionally resonant moments. All in all, not worth the price of the ticket, not a worthy addition to anyone's movie collection, and certainly not a worthwhile piece of media to waste your time one.",0,0,2018-05-09T15:22:18.000Z,mic hackleman,UCJ7anltFsdX-2EBdqjUx8sw,eLwXZ09e-SI,True,UgwgO4gywl4D0pcLEgp4AaABAg

"My recollection of my first time seeing this is vague, as it was about 16 years ago, but I don't recall it being particularly confusing. At the time I watched it, the first Matrix movie was out (which I had seen and enjoyed) but not the sequels, and I believe I had been told that GitS was one of the influences on the Wachowskis. That probably helped set my expectations and minimize confusion.

I... want to like GitS more than I do. It's kinda going for the Blade Runner / film noir moody pacing, but it doesn't have enough depth in the characters or story to keep me engaged, and the philosophy in GitS (while deeper than the philosophy in The Matrix) is not nearly deep enough to be truly meaningful, as opposed to stoner rambling with anime tits. The first half of the movie (leading up to the garbage truck shootout) does a pretty good job of introducing the world, and I *love* the interlude that juxtaposes not-Hong Kong against the Shinto wedding chant (https://youtu.be/WB-ik-Bpl0c), but the action of the second half doesn't really do it for me, the diving scene + subsequent Major/Batou dialogue is boring and borders on nonsense, and the Major/Puppetmaster merger scene is *almost* interesting but not quite. I'm a big fan of ""life goes on"" non-endings, so I *do* like when the Major/Puppetmaster daughter-hybrid goes out into the world at the end of the film, but all-in-all I mostly feel like there's a better movie struggling to get out from under this one.",0,0,2018-05-07T18:55:02.000Z,ChronosTachyon,UCF-uR4LF_XGNTftOBqCZGng,XWr8X4ikQUc,True,Ugx5nJmDzf3Z75NdlKx4AaABAg

"Just finished watching the whole series. Wow. You don't even need to be a fan of the original movie to understand this show is way better than what it needed to be. And it proves that you can succeed making what at first glance could easily be considered ""just another money-grab /unnecessary sequel"". How is that possible? Well, not relying exclusively on nostalgia, offering a true DRAMATIC PROGRESSION (instead of just a series of masturbatory re-enactments from the past) and playing with the unexpected for the sake of true storytelling instead of blatant fan service. Yes, Disney. I'm looking at you. Cobra Kai handles way better its ""tropes"" than Episodes VII & VIII. Not that I want to spoil the show to anybody... but it's impossible not to see the new young characters in Cobra Kai without wondering how amazing the ""new"" STAR WARS trilogy would be if they had the same care and attention to a) the elements we are already familiar with... and b) how they grow, challenge our expectations and re-write what we thought we knew when confronted with the NEW elements. Seriously: Kylo Ren & Rey, ending up in the same ironic, brilliant, vigorous and unexpected situation the young characters end up in Cobra Kai's final episode... that's the way to go.

"HONESTLY, this show does NOT need to be on the same platform as the Hot Tub Time Machine series. Those solid turds would weigh down the beauty of Cobra Kai.

If YouTube were to give support and education to their Red creators apart from shoving them into some overly produced series (in the vein of how Shane Dawson was crash coursed through film production in that Chair Project) then I believe more of the shows on there would be palatable. As a user of Red I don't come to see longer YouTube videos with smoother edits and a better camera. The 5-10 minute formula doesn't scale for me. Other than Mind Field and Youth & Consequences (the later of which I would speculate did educate their YT cast in production values and acting) my only reason for being a Red member was that it came with my Google Play subscription years back.

This is absolutely not a problem and unfortunately nothing about this platform is a charity and those with production-enslaved-minds have combed over the creators with a toothpick to try to find gems that not only bring an audience of their own, but also have the ability to break the mold of what is thought of as YouTube. Many amateurs won't hack it.

The flowers won't always wilt. And in this case they're an assortment of the most beautiful plastic flowers the YouTube executives put on display in the entrance so they can bring in other viewers that will not normally see your content. While I don't agree with your message I enjoy how you presented your opinion and can understand why this may be a concern to content creators on the site.

The problem with YouTube red isn't there fault entirely two of their creators for their exclusive shows had to be fired from YouTube red. I am talking about PewDiePie and Logan Paul.

I hate to defend YouTube but I don't blame them here. They do have problems with the adpocolypse and the current state of the algorithm but in the case of YouTube red they have been burned badly twice by creators therefore this move makes sense.

"I was taking my time to think about the entire situation and came to realize that this could be something amazing. When you look at how Hasbro is towards it's shows like Mlp the current Transformers series and etc you can see that they give as much creative freedom as necessary to make a show enjoyable for millions. I also see that Hasbro trying to take on trying to make Kamen Rider into something for the western viewers as I felt that Saban did a shitty job when they tried that back in the 90s with Vr Troopers, Big Bad Beetle Borgs, Masked Rider and etc like I feel they can bring in proper writers into these shows and make something as a fandom we all want, Something else is that they can use Dragon Knight as an Example to bring Kamen Rider over to the states as that series is and how Kamen Rider is done right for western viewers.

"With the announcement back in February about the cancellation of the current cinematic universe after the Bumblebee movie, Power Rangers will be lucky enough to not be incorporated into the bayformers madness at the very least. But with all comic series being concluded this summer as well, and with the very vague information we have about any upcoming TV series outside of the kindergarten spin-off, it's not exactly a great time for the transformers franchise. Toys-R-Us only made things worse.

".....wait Hela is Loki's daughter? the Agrarian's regenerate? what!!! O.O Your blowing my mind here! do they lose all memory when they come back? has ragnarok happened before? O.O
I totally agree about them maybe being more serious and just letting the big bad destined to destroy their world to talk. its funny but on re-watching I just wanted them to get to the point in that regard and for thor to stop interrupting.
            I do like the parallel and surprise thee was a secret first born as one of the driving issues before was if Thor or Loki would be ruler. finding out there was another option was rather jarring. It was rather confusing that no one else talked about Hela or kept that myth alive. she seemed to scare a lot of people who knew her. and if Odin has been alive this whole time there has to be other Asgardians who were younger or were alive while she was around. even if they were ordered not to talk it still would have gotten out. not everyone could have agreed with Odin. We don't even know how Odin's wife felt about it and it takes two tango to make a baby and I like their mom better than Odin anyway.
        I also don't see why when Odin died he floated away instead of leaving a body.
I don't think Loki would go along with Hela as we know Loki does care about his people.
though did Scurge really have no connection?
     I like Hulk but part of me is still sulking about black widow and hawkeye not being a couple when they had the strongest chemistry.(even if I liked the twist involving hawkeyes love life as well). But it was a nice call back Hulk and her's connection and it calming him down. But its also confusing because we know that Hulk/Banner deliberately left last time. and this could have been a chance to introduce a different love interest(though he did have some chemistry with the valkery though I am happy there were still platonic).
      Over all though I feel like the movie was fun for me. they definitely should have left his friends alive for later.
I was surprised they didn't try to shave thor.

"As a queer person who's had a weird thing for monsters before they even realized it was a projective power fantasy attraction, I relate and appreciate this video immensely. I think you really hit it on the head with the observation that there was an appeal not only to seeing ourselves in the monster, but also in seeing ourselves in the person with whom the monster is smitten. I feel like part of the reason it has that dual appeal comes back to that innate power fantasy aspect of it - monsters are generally depicted as intimidating, resilient, strong characters that seem nigh invulnerable when protecting the person/people they love. It's the kind of strength and fortitude that people would want to wield themselves, or would want of a lover to protect them, and depending on a person's personal experience, either - or even both - could be a subconscious selling point.",6,0,2018-05-01T21:04:24.000Z,DeeDee Doozle,UChHU0syp8OjKQMW1Yssb7FA,ERrVNKEQJA8,True,UgywPoV54ljw4prsWxZ4AaABAg

"Sorry, but I don’t have arguments with myself that are reminiscent of Banner’s in IW. 

I think I get why you don’t like the Infinity Stones. I’m not partial to items of ultimate power that render the user invincible and allow them to bend all of reality to their will. The fact that all power in the universe is neatly divided into six color-coded rocks is also not the most creative of plot devices. I will point out though that they aren’t technically MacGuffins. MacGuffins are items that motivate character behavior, but whose nature is actually immaterial to the plot.

"I know this was released eighteen months ago, but I have a story to tell that was honestly the biggest waste of f*cking time I can remember having on the internet.

A short while ago, I was researching for both Marvel and DC projects I'm working on, and I got curious about the musical tastes of the superhero community in the comics (because trivial sh*t like that can be useful, plus in my opinion it makes them more human), so I decided to dig through and spent three f*cking hours digging around, going from YouTube to Reddit to CBR Forums to the various Wikis to a bunch of ""Superhero Playlist"" articles that was basically just guessing based largely on things like ""Aquaman is Water-Themed, so obviously his music tastes must be all songs about the ocean!"".  ThIs is all I've got:

1) Batman hates Rock & Roll (knew already thanks to Linkara)
2) Dick likes Rock and Roll (same as the above) 
3) Tim Drake likes Green Day (I knew this but had yet to write it down)
4) Red Hood likes Drake (I didn't know this one)
5) Batwoman likes Blondie, 69 Eyes and Sisters of Mercy (knew it already)
6) Hal Jordan and John Stewart like Soul Music (knew already)
7) Hal Jordan likes Pink Floyd (knew already)
8) Peter Parker dislikes Guns N' Roses (trash opinion that I admittedly didn't know)
9) Peter Parker likes David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Elton John, Nick Lowe and Dave Edmunds (did not know)
10) MJ likes Guns N' Roses (Did not know)
11) Superman likes Metallica (I find this hilarious and I didn't know prior to researching)
12) Oliver Queen dislikes the Bee Gees (I knew this already) 

As an aside, my headcanon is that Nightwing's favourite song is Dancing Queen by ABBA. It's not canon...until I actually write for DC, in which case I'll throw hands at anyone who tries to stop me from doing this.

So yeah, all that time spent on trivial nonsense that ended up being stuff I already knew half the time. At least I got Metal-Head Superman out of it, so it wasn't a total waste.",0,0,2018-04-30T20:26:54.000Z,Danny Buckle,UCBArrRb2DCyLUIZMPbgNV-Q,_qBsSPzghjI,True,UgwxjYwBr3sRBJetpXR4AaABAg

"No.  No bloody way.  This is totally a geek/blerd debate.  Thanos sucks as a character?   You hate a McGuffin?   What the hell are you reading?   Or, how old are you?  Because context is everything, and comic readers who just barely reached or passed their 30’s are like the worse..  I mean, I became aware of comics in 1968, the era of the first Marvel revolution when they began to force comic to become more grounded.   I read the older stuff and even as a kid they caused a lot of eye rolling.  For instance Flash’s idiotic rogues gallery - all people with weapons.   Flash can move in the blink of an eye and a guy with a freeze gun gives him trouble?   But I at least appreciate where these come from, why they exist and why they hold the importance they do.   I can’t wait to see this video essay on Thanos.  Because I am always curious about that one hater.   By the way, the final review of any movie - like it or not - is the money it makes.   I think the DCEU pretty much proved that point.   So let’s see what cogent points you make on this.

"I really hated it.
I felt it was just too long. Scenes went on for way too long, and, partly because there were so many characters, it just got frustrating to watch every single one of them make some horrible mistake or another for really silly reasons.
I think Thanos really killed it for me. He's just so stupid? They keep trying to frame him as this noble villain, but he's really not. He's just a very powerful dumbass. I don't think it was morally wrong to bring it up or anything, but I feel like his motive was framed as an ""unacceptable solution"" when it's just not even a solution? I just wanted to shout, that's literally not how anything works you big purple dweeb! he says it worked out in the end on gamora's planet, and i guess he could be lying to save face, but it doesn't sit well with me.

None of it really matters in the end because I know how comics roll, so it just felt like a waste of time.

I very much enjoyed it. From the standpoint of a writer the end made perfect sense considering this is a movie in two parts, so I got that Thanos was going to accomplish his goal at the end of this one. Which doesn't mean I *liked* it, but I feel it shows that the Russos understand making the story feel like this is where it's supposed to be *and* use our connections to the characters to make us feel the pain of said ending.

It'll be interesting to see what the do in the second movie in regards to bringing people back. Is whatever they come up with going to be a blanket resurrection? Or does it only work for some people and not others? What can McGuffin the McGuffin?

Also Thanos' whole thing should have meant the beginning went much different, bc the Asgardians had already lost so many of them in Ragnarok that him killing even more was just pointless slaughter. Sure if some of them attacked him he could've dealt with them, but from what it seems Thor is now the last Asgardian and kind of proves that Thanos' whole mentality is so much BS.",1,1,2018-04-28T19:45:20.000Z,Kael,UCretIO1-wl4AonUjof16-gQ,eLwXZ09e-SI,True,Ugwn5wDHgVbUtp2rRfx4AaABAg

"I still keep coming back to my disappointment with the Soul Stone. This rock has been missing for several movies, causing us all to wonder where it is and wonder what it actually does. In the meantime, we've seen every other Infinity Stone, its power, and--in Infinity Wars--how it empowers Thanos once put in the Gauntlet (e.g., we see Thanos slap around the Hulk with thr Power Stone, we see Thanos teleport with the Space Stone, hell the Time Stone plays a bigger role in this movie than the Soul Stone does). But then in a scope of 30 minutes, suddenly its, ""Oh the Soul Stone isn't missing. It's here. Do this thing. You have it. What does it do? No one knows. Who cares? We won't show Thanos using just that power. Shame on you for thinking otherwise."" For all the mystery surrounding it, the Soul Stone was used for 30 minutes of super condensed, flesh-out-this-character character development. I'm guessing the Soul Stone will play a much bigger part in Avengers 4, but there's almost zero setup for it. But yeah, the movie was fine.

"I really enjoyed the film, I shared your concerns about the stones but I found that Brolin brought something interesting to Thanos. While he does get plenty of screen time, I would have wanted more depth to the character. My perfect Thanos would be constantly straddling that line of this Lovecraftian horror from the stars and deeply disturbed human, but that's not a small order. Perhaps an extended edition will put this over the top, the interviews point to a lot more of Brolin's performance that didn't make the film

The use of music was outstanding, my audience (and I) cheered for those first beats before we entered Wakanda. Every ""assemble"" moment, of which there were several, were perfectly punctuated by the score. 

I really enjoyed Thor in this movie. After such a fun ride in Ragnarok it was great to see Thor reminding everyone that he's a powerhouse. 

There are complaints, Gamora needed more screen time - either in this film or a deeper arc in Guardians 1 & 2, some of the humor felt a little off considering the scale of the conflict, Thor's sidequest would have felt more at home in a solo adventure - but this film doesn't exist in isolation. As a culmination of 10 years of movies and 19 films from 17 directors, hundreds of cast and crew, and decades of source material, this just isn't the kind of film that gets made, and the Russo's didn't just pull it off, they swung for the stratosphere - and nitpicks aside I think they nailed it.",0,0,2018-04-27T16:41:37.000Z,Dom,UC4oLm1c8mhts9A_e7_J6U0g,eLwXZ09e-SI,True,Ugwtf4VITea0mgtiXWN4AaABAg

"As for Starbucks, the people lost their minds. The problem all started with the manager being on a power trip. 
When the guy asked to use the bathroom, why not just let them? 
I also drive daily and need to use the bathroom at times. There are no public bathrooms whatsoever. 
So I use gas stations and McDonald's. 
Despite company, It's a common courtesy to help ur fellow human. 

Regardless, if he needed to use the bathroom so badly, why didn't he leave in search for another place? Why did he insist on staying being uncomfortable and made a scene when he was about to meet someone important for an alleged real estate investment meeting? 

That lead me to believe that the guy saw an opportunity to get there 15 minutes of fame in so they stayed and cried racism. 
In reality, they had no business being there taking up space from actual customers.

"Man oh man, Uprising was a mess. Spoilers ahead y'all.
Mako should have lived. She was Jake's only family left and that could have explained a lot of exposition between them and their father. She should have been on the ground with the team, meanwhile, they could have also had Charlie Hunnam reprise his role as Raleigh Beckett, cause where was he? Having him die in the decade between the original and uprising is a joke, honestly and would have emphasized the theme of the younger generation having to fight the war of the previous generation. Amara's narrative would have also benefitted better from other pilots commenting on her past instead of her training with a human brain? (I don't remember using human brains for training in ANY lore.) It would have been better to have more sequences on her training and her having trouble with working with pilots, and then have her pilot Scrapper in the end since she's obviously a better J-Tech Engineer and can build the way for smaller Jaegers that can assist maintenance of larger ones on the field which would set her up for leading a division in a third movie. And then there's the Mt. Fuji McGuffin. I don't think California of Hong Kong is anywhere close to Fuji, but that's where first landfall was for Tresspasser was, wasn't it? Now if the Precursor infected Newt learned about Mt. Fuji's volatile state from Hermann, that would have been better. But wouldn't the PPDC have confiscated any volatile kaiju parts?

"I pretty much tuned out once the trailer confirmed that this would have nothing to do with spider-man. The main thing I found compelling about the Symbiote was that it so perfectly manifested the horror of a stalker. When I looked at the relationship between the Venom Symbiote and Spider-man I saw the Jilted-Ex-From-Hell, where this alien being would not take no for an answer and was so entitled to the connection with Spidey that they will stalk and terrorize them and then kill them in a 'If I can't have you no one can"" way.
I know Venom had a comic run as an anti-hero but I just don't see the appeal. Poor Eddie was the Rebound Host and the idea that they become an anti-hero makes the horror of the symbiote kinda toothless (with all intention).

"What I like about the Sam Raimi Trilogy is the emotional backgrounds that are focused on so heavily. It’s not only comic come to life, but it’s like we are seeing the awakening of each characters’s moral, destiny, fate, purpose, etc. Throughout the film your super hero isn’t a handsome pretty boy that you wish you could become.. instead he’s an insecure lonely unpopular geek that makes you feel like you’re looking in a mirror, both mentally and emotionally. He has conflict, and struggles between being Peter Parker and Spider-Man, Living an everyday life and living the great power/responsibility. Sure, he is praised by New York as Spider-Man.. but in the end he’s just a kid, and he can’t get what he wanted the most. And whenever Peter cried, so did I. But these sad moments are no ordinary sad moments like a love story(Note: I find those typical twilight love stories boring but it’s just an example since people cry to it), another death in another movie, or a sad moment in some other story... No.. This is Spider-Man.. the man who always saves the day when there’s distress, with his Spider sense, webs, wall crawling, and strength.. And he has tears too. And in other words; When you see Peter Parker cry here, you think- “Oh shoot.. Spider-Man is crying..” at least, that’s the vibe I get, and whenever he cries, I do too because I know that he’s struggling with life and I know it is hard.. and in the action scenes like the final fight against Green Goblin, the train scene when he stops the train, when he uses the black suit against Sandman and in his fight against Harry, you can see how Peter- I mean Tobey, expresses the anger, struggle, etc all so well, thanks to Sam Raimi defining his strength, anger, desire, and revenge.

As a kid who felt so out of their skin for not feeling like either sex, and not even feeling sexually interested at all as a teen, it becomes easy to see yourself as monstrous or wrong, and want to see humanity in others who could or have shown to feel the same way.
