"Movie BobHow is she the worst female character ever ? I can give a few reasons why she not  1.She is THE ONLY  FEMALE  NINJA SHINOBI !!!!!

 2.She is  the only  female mutant turtle!!!!!
 
 3. females are naturally  more mature that boys so she not a killjoy 
She is one of the coolest female Mutants! How dare you say she the worst just because she a female  ninja shinobi ?!?! That's sexist!!!!!

 4.Don't get me wrong but sure  it may have been a weird  series but   SHE IS NOT ONE OF THE WORST  CHARACTERS IN FACT  SHE ONE OF THE BEST FEMALE MUTANT  CHARACTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

5. she is not a sex object she a female turtle (with a Mask braid which is pretty cool) who speaks her mind and kicks butt with her psychic ablities  she did have shell  boobs you can clearly see them .

 6.  she had a weapon which was her magic chi and psychic abilities. 

7. I'm only mad  because they could have made her even more of a kick but bad ass  character by doing more research on what a shinobi actually is giving her a weapon and having her mask a different color such as white or black to tell her apart from leo better",1,0,2018-09-23T03:25:06.000Z,Ayanna Watson,UCJf8MBRBkgt_cW-tW8OiOvw,VG9xfK0VhBo,True,UgyUamyLQV2afIN3_IZ4AaABAg

"So I like your idea of these heroes being out of their own time, like Captain America and that their new powers are a symbol of the changes they can make to their own character but I would take them into space. We are going to have Avengers and X-Men storylines on Earth, as well as solo movies. We only have Guardian's of the Galaxy in space, which depicts the universe as colourful, fun and magical. I would use the Fantastic Four as the Star Trek movies of the MCU, which depicts the universe as realistic, challenging and scientific. First I would have answer a distress call, which only they receive, then introduce the Kree-Skrull war, with the ending having the Fantastic Four team up with Nova and save a primitive race from the Super Skrull. Next film I would have them receive information that planets are being destroyed, they do some research and find the Silver Surfer at the next expected planet to be wiped out. They think they've saved another planet with primitive life on from the Silver Surfer when Galactus arrives and devours it. The ending has the Fantastic Four convincing the Silver Surfer to betray Galactus and stopping him from going to Earth, for now. The final film is Doctor Doom, the guy who sent the Fantastic Four the distress signal and information in hopes that a space war zone or a celestial would kill his arch-nemesis. His final plan is to use Doom Bots to travel to every universe and kill Reed Richards, this introduces us to the Council of Reed Richards and ends with the Fantastic Four returning to Earth to defeat Doctor Doom at his castle, in his Country of Latveria.

"Spiderman 2002: This film show us how it feels to be Peter Parker. To be abandoned. I genuinely feel sad. This film tries to send a message about *""With great power, comes great, responsibility""*

Spiderman 2: This movie is trying to send a message about sacrifice. Like in this one scene where Peter has to deliver pizza in time, but he had to save the kid from the truck. And he loses  his job. MJ relationship with Peter is broken. his grade is bad. He has to save a train without a break and people finally knew who he is. His friend hates him.

"Bob I’m a little confused why changing Batman’s race seems like it wouldn’t impact the story at all to you.

POCs have to carry ourselves differently in this society and a black (or another non-white race) billionaire is going to operate with a double consciousness that a white one won’t. No matter how rich you are you’re likely still going to have “the talk” with your kid about violence both personal and institutional that people of color often have with their children which means that the whole illusion of safety that Bruce operated under before his parents are killed isn’t going to be there.

Part of what makes Batman work is that he’s a simultaneous embodiment and refutation of white privilege. He is a rich white guy who decided crime was important because it happened to him and then realized that if crime can happen to him it’s happening to people with a lot less power and resources than him so he needs to stand up for them.

That notion of old money getting its world rocked wouldn’t necessarily work the same way because unless you want remove the legacy of systemic oppression from the DCU then you’re going to hand over the Waynes’ life to a family who is likely not that far removed from not being part of the elite.

"Bob, 

In relation to the ""corporate behavior indicates which side is winning"" argument with respect to Kap: if one's side wants to see social justice fostered within a space that depowers and moves beyond the corporate-capitalist model of reality, then watching the Nike commercials would not come across as ""your side winning"" but rather as yet another example of how political actions and movements are coopted by the larger, social dynamical forces which foster the same oppression Kap took a knee against in the first place.

I agree with you that dunking on centrist liberals is a stupid use of one's time within this given context, but that doesn't necessarily make this a good sign. In fact, in these bases, it could be seen as a dangerous sign that sees nasty fucking corporations pivoting towards social justice issues to provide their malignant business practices a nice face to work under.

While it may be a good sign that people are thinking about these issues more and siding with them more, if your goal is to build a society where hierarchy and static society are outmoded, then it can equally AND simultaneously be seen as something that's dangerous. Just because a concept is within the zeitgeist doesn't guarantee the forms it will take, or even if it will be overall effective at addressing the structural problems it comments against. 

Anyways it's been fun seeing you continue to push out content and keep thinking. Cheers, dude, and glad you are willing to foster these sorts of discussions.",0,0,2018-09-17T18:56:42.000Z,InfiniteHelmsman559,UCsEXnh5aFFEcOB0yc3jipHQ,2QYIoKtTEkY,True,UgwMBbwY1N36Jc9qFJl4AaABAg

"‪My biggest takeaway from the Colin Kaepernick/Nike story is that everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but nobody is entitled to their own facts.‬

‪According to The Washington Post’s police shooting database, there have been 90 unarmed Black people killed between 2015-2018 (see links below). While that’s still a huge number and my heart goes out to those families, we’ve allowed social media and Hollywood to become our moral compass.‬

‪Yes, there are some cops who abuse their authority—I know this from personal experience—just like there are some people who mouth off at cops who are just doing their job.‬

‪Wanna know how to fix this problem? Treat others the way you want to be treated. Remember that simple rule we all learned in elementary school? It still works like a charm. #JustDoIt‬

"The ""black people like superman more"" is, anecdotally, true.  In my experience.  For a variety of reasons, that some people certainly might not be consciously aware of.  There are the obvious differences, like that Superman fights giant robots and monsters far more often than anything else.  While Batman tends to fight crazy people and poor people.  It's easy to get behind the guy that is smiling and fighting things that threaten all of humanity.  It's not so easy to really be into what is essentially a supercop.  The fascist undertones can make some people uncomfortable.  They may not notice it, but their brain does.

There's also the point that Superman just has a more diverse cast of characters.  Historically, he just seems to have more ""black friends"".  I know: Batman is Batman.  But I'm just talking about likeability and relatability.  Superman has Steel, other reporters, Parallel universe black superman, black scientist buddies, more team-ups with black heroes.  Batman has Lucius Fox.

Also, Superman is a symbol of strength paired with moral clarity.  He is able to function as a fairly decent father figure.  That's an important factor in his popularity.",0,0,2018-09-17T05:16:01.000Z,JK Clark,UCf7XxJFw3IB6e8XkJHhf_1w,2QYIoKtTEkY,True,UgwwC_f2qBipcLNicT54AaABAg

"Bob, while you're right that Nike backing Kap means that his point is winning culturally, part of the criticism by leftists of mainstream liberals is that they have become too content with cultural victories as a substitute for politics. Kap's protest is about a long-term and major problem with how our society is constructed, and any addressing of it is going to necessarily have to contend with the power police hold in our society. And while I'm happy Kap is getting a paycheck to continue his activities, I worry about the possibility that his protest will become a symbol to launder the image of companies like Nike in the way that companies sponsor floats in pride parades and paint everything pink for a month, and that the uplifting of the symbol will detach it from the radical politics it originally represented in the way that much of the culture reveres MLK without a full sense of what he did and stood for, to the point that assholes will say that MLK would hate Black Lives Matter protesters because they're too ""violent"" and ""disruptive.""",0,0,2018-09-17T01:38:00.000Z,Malos Aires,UCGLRRvgueg_DzqWrYaYNybw,2QYIoKtTEkY,True,Ugy7P0lGbKmBY3QQT-B4AaABAg

"Your view on WB greenlighting more projects starring female DC characters is needlessly cynical. Call it an ""over correction"" if you like, but the success of Wonder Woman, DC Superhero Girls, the CW shows (which have a huge female presence in the casts and fanbase), Young Justice and Teen Titans (again, tons of female fans) and the popularity of characters like Harley Quinn would seem to me to be more than enough to move forward on those projects. We also know that young women are among the biggest growing audiences for actual comics and have always been one of the biggest audiences for movies and TV. The audience is clearly there, so I'm not entirely what data you believe they need to get before moving in this direction. From my view, it looks like they're just taking what they're already cultivated in other media and trying to bring that to the films.

I mean, since everyone is always clamoring for them to do things ""the Marvel way,"" would you rather they make 15 some odd movies that mostly star dudes before finally giving a woman top billing? (Also note that by the time most of these DC projects get off the ground, ""Captain Marvel"" will probably have come and crushed the box office, and thus giving even more reason for WB to head in this women-led direction).

Plus, it's not like they've exorcised male led movies from the lineup. Aquaman, Shazam, and Joker are all still happening. Ava Duvernay and Geoff Johns are currently producing New Gods and Green Lantern Corps respectively, which are definitely going to have a big male presence. Flash is supposedly still on (apparently they just waiting to see how Aquaman does before saying anything).

"Is it strange that I'd rather have black Superman than black Batman? Both COULD work just fine, but I feel it'd be a lot easier to farm meaningful material from Superman if you switched up his race because there's an inherent question about how growing up a racial minority (let alone a literal alien) could compound or change the type of affect we normally see in Clark Kent. Also, maybe if they make the bold choice with casting, they can let Superman BE Superman instead of trying to turn him into something he isn't (scowly, moody). Not to mention that so much of Batman's character is tied up in ""old money"", which, to me, is always going to shout ""white guy"". The only problem is that, even if these rumors were true, I doubt that Warner Bros is looking at this casting choice as an artistic direction. They see Black Panther was insanely successful and, taking the most superficial lessons from a situation, are probably just checking the box of what they think will be popular. Superman with a black actor could be a profound new direction, but not if the only thought behind it is ""how can we ape what's trendy?"".",0,0,2018-09-16T08:21:53.000Z,QuestWorthy,UCT0r4n9uWk8ezVDnBTRAU3A,2QYIoKtTEkY,True,Ugw7ffWb0gHa0Ge8-5Z4AaABAg

"I'm sorry but you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about in terms of the comic sales stuff.

Trades absolutely get counted in how well a book sells, it's just that most books that sell poorly in singles also sell poorly in trades, it's a VERY rare exception when stuff sells well in trades after selling poorly in singles. Do you really think DC and Marvel don't take trade and digital numbers into account? You do know we get trade numbers as well as monthly singles ones right? Both from Diamond and Bookscan, so we know almost exactly how much books sell in trades. The only sales we don't have hard numbers on is digital, however from what people in the know say it seems to be typically anywhere from 10-13% of physical sales, so not these mythical insane numbers you seem to think. Companies care about single issue sales the most because that's where they make the vast majority of their money from and it helps gauge the general popularity of a book.

If you'd like to hear about a comic book store that not only supports itself selling comic books, but has grown virtually every year then I suggest you give the Comics Conspiracy Podcast a listen.

"Bob, when you say that Nike is an indicator, it’s worth keeping in mind that Nike is not trying to have mass appeal but is very specifically targeting themselves to particular consumer markets. Specifically, they are interested in what are called HENRY (highly educated, not rich yet) consumers in urban markets—they are the people buys $150 sneakers. HENRYs have particular political inclinations. Nike doing this makes them appear “brave” to those people that they are really trying to appeal. One could argue that HENRYs have an ability to steer the political direction of the country as a whole so in that sense the ad is an “indicator,” but that’s a much weaker argument than “Nike is a sign of the times.” Rather, the truth is that Nike’s advertising is a sign of where a very specific set of consumers is at this time and really not much else. 

(Side note: I’m a liberal and I’m all for saying that the Colin Kaepernick ad is cool even if Nike is also “evil” in the sense that contemporary capitalism incentivizes corporations to be evil. Both statements are true. This is just to say that my comment above is about intellectual honesty, not trying to “own the liberals.” Likewise, I’m not trying to argue that the country isn’t with Nike on this one; it’s just that the Nike ad shouldn’t be used as an indicator of where we’re at. It really doesn’t say one way or the other where we are at as a country.)",4,0,2018-09-15T19:09:44.000Z,Connor Syrewicz,UC52GSPnmpsXbB2fgGlAqdOQ,2QYIoKtTEkY,True,Ugxy8jYcH5hCrOi-qaF4AaABAg

Edited to add: I took a sociology of sport in America class in college in 2012, right before activism in sport started to come back. Ali was always the first example we went back to.

"No one reads comic books. That fact is just going to become clearer to everyone as the dwindling numbers of old fans die off and all the small local comic book stores close their doors. And throwing tantrums at any and everyone trying to do anything even remotely inclusive or progressive to bring in new fans is just going to speed that process up. 

Really curious what Hasbro is gonna do when Marvel(Disney) and DC(Warner Bros.) stop physical publishing all together. Hobby/Game/Toy stores that sell comics are gonna have a massive upheaval. At the very least they will all gain about 40% more floor space as comics get phased out of their stock. Hasbro (i.e. Wizards of the Coast) has a lot of product that does not get sold at Walmart and Target. With the death of Toys R' Us at the hands of decades of Bain Capital mismanagement and reaganomics there is something of a vacuum.

"Slide form and semi-scripted feels better then unscripted v-blog for this series IMO. Less to do with 'on camera' then the 'unscripted' bit. 

The movie reviews for geek are on-camera and those are perfectly fine. They are also not 30+ minutes long and rambling. That kinda thing goes a lot better inter-cut with video other then someone staring into a camera, IMO. 

And, generally, slightly-scripted is always gonna trump un-scripted for certain people for whom having a list of bullet-points helps them keep focus. Not knowing bob personally I couldn't call if he is such or not, but 2nd hand I notice a positive difference between the non-scripted and semi/fully-scripted stuff. Though that might be my bias of ""oh this is labeled as one thing I think is better so I am inclined to judge it as such"" 

Noteably, this does not apply to group-discussions. Bullet points there can be useful but, say, that trial series where you played games with family/friends? That was fine being unscripted, since the back and forth banter is part of the charm. That's harder to do alone in a room talking to nothing but a camera.

"The ""superman curse"" is real, I'm afraid. Damn shame, because WB technically had LESS work to do than marvel. They didn't have to wait for the rights issues to clear up with other studios, cavill wasn't a bad find, sfx and greenscreen are standard now, and they have tons of money to throw at this. Yet they still keep reacting, instead of planning. I dont blame cavill all for leaving. Best for him to use that push from Ml, witcher, and a possible bond movie down the line...

As for black superman: WB is still trying to do stunt casting like it's 1989, or worse yet, 1998 when that God awful Nick Cage superman ALMOST became a reality.

She should be but I'm getting off track and yeah Superman and Batman her kind of representing how things are now the immigrants trying to make their way up versus old money hopefully somewhere down the line we can team up and make the world a better place and by the way Bob you're the only person I can probably listen to do commentary for about

"I don't think a black actor could convincingly play Superman because Superman isn't interesting enough to deal with a racial shift.
Johnny Storm is a fun, adventurous, headstrong character, with enough personality that it didn't make the slightest difference who played him as long as they could convey that (not that Michael B Jordan was allowed to do so in Fant4stic).  His appearance - beyond ""young, handsome dude; sometimes on fire"" - is so far down his list of character traits, his race is meaningless.
Superman, however, is the character equivalent of beige: bland, all-American white guy, who can disappear into a crowd with nothing more than a pair of glasses and a slight hunch. Even the simple act of making him black seems far too much for the character to handle; like serving a chicken madras to someone who's only ever had chicken soup.",6,4,2018-09-15T12:29:50.000Z,ByMonitorLight,UCjyynttQhiDzGW2OTuHm2vA,2QYIoKtTEkY,True,UgyYbAs1ND1KjMvKrwp4AaABAg

"Bob, TLJ is  Dear John letter to Star Wars fans - it is quite clear on it's tone and conduct that it just wants to trash their love of the previous films. And it has succeeded wildly on that regard. So much so that there are now people who aren't all misogynistic Nazis' who just have walked away from the franchise. Also Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy and J.J Abrams have come out and told people who dare criticize it to basically fuck off. Yeah, nice one! 

I really don't like this film at all. For a multitude of reasons I think it failed but mostly because it was just so awfully written/plotted, had so many bad choices made for character arcs and worst of all because it makes the most egregious example of a Mary Sue as the leading character in the new franchise.  And that is an indisputable fact. Rey has no challenges to her at all, she is amazing at everything, does fuck all to earn anything so why should anyone care about her journey? This is not making a strong female protagonist, it's a travesty of the whole idea.",0,0,2018-09-09T00:58:17.000Z,Talwyn22,UChIujt00OL_HaR9StZpIpvA,qf_rqde7B0A,True,Ugxu7-NOuFPcj_XirBV4AaABAg

"Today's been a tough day and this brought genuine, happy tears.  The Escapist was my gateway for internet content and it changed how I thought about what I watched through its insightful critiques of films, games, and media industries.  Yahtzee gave voice to something I'd started thinking about but didn't know how to say:  that I enjoyed games for their stories as much as for their gameplay.  Jim Sterling pushed me to be critical of businesses and their practices, and actually that's helped me out more recently as a business communications and public policy student.  Bob, your shows made me realize that pop culture does not exist in a vacuum, and that its broader, worldly influences are as important to scrutinize as much as a bad movie.  Graham, Paul, and the rest at Loading Ready Run reminded me to make time for creative projects; in tandem with everyone they reinforced how much I needed to keep writing in my life (I'm also an English Creative Writing student).  And god, could you all make me laugh when I needed to.

When GamerGate happened I learned how to let go of something, even if it was foundation, because it was the right thing to do.  I realized soon after it happened that I needed to be better, because I knew that I had contributed to that culture without knowing I had.  I began to piece together how the ways I used to think; the words I used without understanding had bolstered a horrifying contingent and alienated so many people.

"Here's the thing... the assholes making the biggest stink in online spaces? They hardly EVER get encountered at conventions. Conventions are where people go to be happy, and ""The Usual Gang Of Assholes"" wouldn't waste a dime on a con-badge for that reason among others- chief among them their apocalyptic resignation that their lot will never improve due to ""The Feminists"" and ""The Globalists"" taking all their toys away, and there's nothing for it but to remain cooped up in their smelly goblin-warrens, lashing out angrily at a world they're growing increasingly detached from, adrift in the sheltered harbor of their own delusions.

Ever hear of a Scottish Neo-Nazi named Colin Robertson, who makes YouTube content under the nom-de-guerre ""Millennial Woes?"" Now THERE'S a sterling example of what I'm talking about. A card-carrying White Nationalist, anti-Semitic, anti-progress, anti-change, anti-woman, anti-outsider douchebag... who doesn't actually DO anything but make YouTube videos in the attic of his father's house, no light save for the glow of his computer-screen, in which he smokes like a chimney and whines about how Western Civilization is doomed because white people own slightly less of it. His college-career was cut short by the realization that he'd have to talk to non-white people, and one of his ""man on the street"" videos features footage of folks counter-protesting the Alt-Right dancing on the street features him muttering sullenly about them being ""degenerates and reprobates and losers."" Because they're having FUN.

Fun is anathema to cynical, joyless assholes... and conventions are where we nerds go to have fun. I'm not surprised you DIDN'T have an encounter with people who tuck tail and run back home at the sight of a freaking BENNETON ad. ""Oh noes!

Hearing this made me realize just how far the internet has fallen. Remember Project Chanology? When 4chan was actually worth a damn? Because looking back, organizing a protest in New York City wearing plastic Guy Fawkes masks is actually pretty damn insane. Imagine trying to convince yourself to go to that. You don't know anyone there. That's the point of Anonymous, nobody knows anyone.

"57:10 i'm not a superhero or comic book fan, but this is basically how i feel about the current state of the movie musical/disney live-action reboot genre as a whole. the production designs are lavish and beautiful, there are some great new additions to the source material, but overall, it's just uninspired rehashings of stories we've heard before, told by people who can't sing and/or are sleepwalking their way through the film. i feel that this analysis (which, while i didn't wholly agree with, is some of the most in-depth and educational re: film studies on this site) has a lot in common with lindsay ellis' recent takedown of beauty and the beast (2017). i actually liked that movie, and i didn't think bvs was ~that~ bad. but, both franchises are more concerned with the ""connective tissue"" and ""plot holes"" than they are with actual storytelling, so they end up producing objectively mediocre-to-bad films that we all *want* to love more than we actually do. well done, bob. we all appreciate your hard work.",0,0,2018-09-04T02:39:33.000Z,the fatimagic,UCUIeX7a0q9DsSGuNx8pnqbw,uuwxDLdXALc,True,Ugzio2knw-SEB_JD-uJ4AaABAg

"I think the reason Harry Potter doesn't come up in conversations about serialization of films is simple: it had an end-point.

I don't want to put words into people's mouths, but generally speaking, the most fundamental criticism of over-serialization of movies is that you get this continual ""now"", a story that never ends, that keeps going without any hint of termination. And Harry Potter didn't really have that as a possibility. It was seven books, period (well, until they started inventing things because JK Rowling needed a deeper money bin).

The difference between adapting a series of books and adapting a comic storyline is that the latter can continue on in perpetuity. Marvel and DC made their money in comics on what are essentially ""soap operas for boys"": stories about sets of characters that can continue to be told *forever*.",0,0,2018-09-03T03:58:35.000Z,GeneralBolas,UCA4GaeaeoTxXrQwtY6hcQNg,A8BPzCvrxLY,True,UgztiwDxYgUFl4ZA6XV4AaABAg

"i decided to rewatch this one after the announcement of the newest movie featuring linda hamilton and mackenzie davis. and rewatching this reminded me of how much i disliked bob's pitch to begin with. i think, like others have said when bob revews something terminator-related, he kind of doesn't understand a big part of what made t1 and t2 work so well--the human element. i mean yeah, he's right in the sense that they were subversions of formulaic action movies, but that's largely because of the presence of the connor crew as characters. kyle reese was a relatively scrawny, normal dude next to arnold, whose type would normally be the hero of an action movie. sarah connor is your average everywoman, who (eventually with her teenage son) use their smarts and emotional understanding to kick ass and save the day. *that's* why the scene in t2 when sarah *doesn't* kill dyson is so fucking important. *that's* the heart of the franchise--where humanity and machines compare and contrast. so i'm actually really happy they're bringing sarah (and hopefully john) back for the new film. like bob, though, i really hope this one is the final bookend. give us a satisfying follow-up to t2 and end it. after i saw genyshit i was bob in his review (after this new one): STOP MAKING TERMINATOR MOVIES lol.",0,0,2018-09-03T02:27:27.000Z,the fatimagic,UCUIeX7a0q9DsSGuNx8pnqbw,EEJMDet82Hk,True,UgxfkTsHi5SYfQV3VZd4AaABAg

"conspiracy theory: the Disney executive (Alan Horne) is actually full-on rabid Trump fan.  He got mad about James Gunn criticizing his idiot God-Emperor, so he told the alt-right guys to find whatever flimsy excuse to stir up controversy so he would have an excuse to fire James Gunn.  That's why he was fired so fast with so little confirmation on such poor reasoning.

Thus, literally everyone with a brain thinks it's a bad decision, and why the Exec refuses to budge despite the entire cast and crew wanting to work with James Gunn, and the movie being a gigantic money pit if they don't move forward.  Now they can't rehire James Gunn because everyone knows the exec is alt-right, and everyone wants to work with James Gunn and refuses to work with the executive.

"I get the thing about the nazis.  Nobody wants them to ""win"" something.  Not that it really makes any difference one way or the other how they feel about anything, because they'll be shit people doing shit things regardless of success or failure.  It won't make the slightest bit of difference to them.  Do you see them suddenly hanging up their prejudices and going ""Oh, the public dislikes us?  I never thought about it like that!""  Not a chance!  So it's not going to be effective.  But I can understand the principle, and that's important alongside practicality... in isolation.

Accepting that it's a valid gesture in that way... that doesn't piss me off.  What does, is that I know for most people that's genuinely not what they are actually caring about here.  What most people are actually caring about here is ""gimme movie"".  Which... by itself, would be absolutely fine.  But here's the thing.  I had not heard about what Gunn said before this.  I only knew about it after this.  The reasons the info was revealed?  Dispicable.  But the info itself being revealed?  I am glad that happened.  I'm glad I learned that.  That wasn't actually a bad thing to have publicized, late or not.  The only reason it's bad is because of the way it happened.  The fact that the info is out there for people who didn't know it before (like me), that's a good thing.

And now, whenever someone waives the thing he did away with a throwaway ""yeah they're bad, yeah it's disgusting""... it reminds me of that Bojack Horseman episode where they say ""hearts and minds"" after talking about school shootings.  You don't CARE.  You're making an excuse!  You don't genuinely care about the thing he actually did, or it would affect you... it's not affecting you... you're saying it like a disclaimer to get along to the thing you actually want... the movie.  Hey, I'm a big fan of these movies too.  They are NOT more important than something like this, no movie is.

""Trumped-up bullshit""?  HE DID ACTUALLY SAY THOSE THINGS.  And yes, THAT IS DISGUSTING and DOES say something about his character.  It can't not.  No fucking body says that shit in normal everyday life.  Your alarm bells should be ringing, but you're blinded by the fucking details and I'm sorry, but they're largely irrelevant... again, this will have no effect on those nazis either way.  Hitler was vegetarian.  If Hitler had made some anti-meat propaganda involving the documentation of actual animal cruelty, would that make the animal cruelty suddenly be a FINE IDEA?  Would that suddenly mean that moralistically, everyone has to be fine with the worst that factory farming has to offer... just because it was Hitler who said it, for Hitlery reasons?  It's the same fucking kind of misassociation.  The reasons are just as irrelevant.

This is what pisses me off.  Someone's the victim of this shit.  Nobody gives a fuck.  Nobody cares.  Someone perpetrates this shit, however?  Oh, jump all over ourselves to defend him!  Start a campaign!  Can we not FOR ONCE pick a GOOD PERSON to launch a fucking moral campaign over?  What he did WAS NOT HARMLESS.  And similarly as you won't stop bringing it up, I will not shut the fuck up about it either.  I feel really strongly about this.  Anyone who can have that spill out of their mouth has something mentally wrong with them along those lines that needs fixing.  I'm all for fixing that.  Get him help, monitor him and keep him away from kids.  I don't wish him any harm as long as he never actually goes through with it (something, btw, that you can't be sure of - fucking honestly, everyone was reading the same stuff I was right?  Decent people DO NOT simply say that!).  What I'm not all for, is a public outpouring of grief for someone like that as if they're the most victimest victim who ever lived and were injusticed with no basis whatsoever - it's right there in the phrase you opt to use ""trumped-up bullshit"".  Trumped-up?  More like dug-up.  Bullshit?  FUCK NO.  That right there is your cause-mindedness actually demonstrating how it can turn a fact in your mind into a fiction in your mind, according to what does or doesn't support what you're saying.  HE DID. SAY. THOSE. THINGS.  And they WERE. NOT. HARMLESS.  And let's be plain and straightforward about it, it's mostly NOT for the misguided-but-understandable reason of ""because nazis did it"", that people want him rehired.  It's mostly for the selfish prick reason of ""gimme movie"".

People are glossing over and trampling upon the real and actual harm a tirade of edgy jokes like that can both itself do and also be a cover for.  Even on the (very low) chance that it's not covering up any character flaw or history of anything (something I don't believe for a second), this has still harmed people.  You think paedos gain the confidence to do what they do from nazis getting victories?  Hell no, it's THIS - THIS is the kind of thing that makes them feel accepted in society.  ""Jokes"" like that.  This guy, has at the very least indirectly ruined a kid's life.  If there's nothing more to it, that still remains the case.  So FUCK HIM and FUCK HIS EMPLOYMENT.  And yeah, I guess by extension fuck your hashtag movement.

Ask yourself which of your friends has ever blurted out something as bad as what Gunn did.  And then ask yourself how you'd honestly feel about them after they did.  Put yourself in those shoes.  Maybe they say ""well anyway, hilarity aside, I'm still up for babysitting your kids yeah?""  Ask yourself if you wouldn't find an excuse for it not to happen.  I would.  Anyone who knows about the pervasive permission that chauvanist jokes give rapists (and about the very related origins they emerge from), knows what I mean with these fears.  I refuse to have sympathy for this guy's employment.  I won't wish him well, and I don't want him to get his job back.  And I reckon his silence speaks volumes - he's not defending himself.  There's probably a reason for that.

Guardians of the Galaxy remain some of my favourite movies ever.  And so do Pirates of the Carribbean.  I still acknowledge that Chris Benoit's pro wrestling matches, removed from the context, were some of the best the world has seen and there was a reason he used to be my favourite.  I'll hear an R Kelly song on the radio, and my day is ruined because that stuff's so catchy it sticks in your head and comes back time and time again... same for Chris Brown, same for David Bowie.  Dubious as hell for whether or not he actually did it (probably the most dubious possible given the weird circumstances and all the money flying around), but nevertheless same for Micheal Jackson.  Every time Del Torro's attached to something, as brilliant as he is at what he does, my mind can't help but access the knowledge that he supported the pardoning of Polanski.  And I'm certainly not about to watch an actual Polanski film in a million years.

ALL of these things ruin art.  But they should, because they ruin lives.  And art shouldn't be more important than lives.  Now Disney, please hire someone who hasn't done any of this shit.  There are people out there needing jobs.  Some of them are actually good people!  Get one.  Make a movie.

I really hope people can see where I'm coming from with this.  All of this hashtag movement stuff is so very group-think, so very ""get on board or die"" style.  My viewpoint is still valid, and my priorities are still valid, and I will continue to defend it.  I won't be made to feel like I'm wrong, just because a thing is popular.  It's gonna require some reasoning.

Until then, I understand why people think different, and I understand how some people can seperate the art from the artist even when I can't, and sometimes I indeed do manage to (usually when the thing that was done isn't as bad).  It depends, it always depends.  And that's a useful skill if you can, and I don't begrudge you it.  What I don't like is where it dips into pretending stuff that happened isn't so bad after all (or after some time).  Nope, won't accept that, not ever.  There are things that time does not heal, and these are among them.  Time should not forgive them either.  And how good you are at what you do?  Well that shouldn't ever forgive anything.  It's vitally important this society rot gets sharply discouraged, and I don't give a fuck about the feelings of a bunch of nazis, nor the cynicism of a multinational corporation (both of which will remain unchanged no matter what anyone does).  Regardless how this all came about, the only thing Disney did wrong here was to hire him in the first place.",0,0,2018-08-27T10:37:32.000Z,Jane Ross,UCQAvN9SbsNcNZeT46xw2ztg,jtJuEr1ZfYo,True,UgwLOJRDCUUiIilsz2p4AaABAg

"Diz stepping away from this may be their attempt to put the whole scandal on hold for awhile. Time is on their side, not on the actors' sides. Putting them in a holding pattern puts their livelihood at risk, and pressures them to cave.

I'm sure this is more complicated,  but believe me,  the idea of the consequences of actually stopping such a big franchise in its  tracks is going to weigh heavily. Now the special thing here may be that Bautista is not a regular actor, and he is backed hard by fans, but Hollywood isn't known for its loyalty, and if Disney stalls this until the crap blows over and people stop listening, Bautista and the cast will have to cave or be left out in the cold.

I still hope it goes the other way. I hope everyone else cares as much as I do.

"This video had me so TRIGGERED multiple times, I could not finish it before I had to quit and go into my SAFE SPACE.

To alt-left SJWs like you, EVERYONE who isn't a member of Antifa or BLM is a member of the so-called ""alt-right"" and a ""Nazi"".  Your ideas are to empty and without logic that your only defense is to call someone with superior logic and reason a ""Nazi"".

Your praise of the dumpster fire that was Star Wars VIII made me vomit in my mouth a little.  As a movie buff, you CLEARLY didn't watch the same film that everyone else saw.  The plot made very little sense.  The characters' motivations and actions made no sense and did nothing to progress the story.  The whole ""subverting your expectations"" and ""hurr durr feminism"" in lieu of actual plot and characterization is infuriating.

To quote Luke Skywalker (who, BTW, didn't behave like  the character Luke Skywalker""),  and Captain  Kirk, as far as Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy go, we should ""let it die"".

Marvel did the right thing to fire a convicted sex offender and pedophile.  However, what they should have done was, instead of instantly shit-canning the sex offender, they should have said, ""We will thoroughly investigate the allegations"", count up how much money they will make from GOTG3, then make up some story about how James Gunn apologized and explained that he has changed since then and it will never happen again.  

OTOH, I totally believe you that Hollywood executives have such fragile egos and such strong god complexes that any show of weakness is a death sentence.  Marvel will never say, ""Upon further investigation, the allegations against James Gunn were without merit.  We regret hastily dismissing James Gunn and will welcome him back to the Marvel Family.""   That would show that Marvel executives are human and were so indoctrinated by alt-left SJW #MeCarthyism, they were unable to make sensible business decisions.  

If Marvel were to change their mind, which they won't, it will involve a very large payoff to James Gunn to soothe his hurt feelings.

"On the new Format: It seems fine, but there seems to be an audio-synchronization problem on the last few. I don't know if that's because you're trying to put them out rapidly or what, just letting you know.

"I think Disney are currently caught deciding between the best of two not great outcomes for them: they re-hire Gunn, and they're seen to bow to fan-pressure, and how ever much they want it to look like the MCU is 'for the fans', they do not want to be made to look like they're controlled by the fans.
On the other hand, if they don't re-hire Gunn, and they do manage to push out another GotG movie at some point, it will likely be the last. At least one of the core cast will move on, the inevitable back-lash - regardless of whatever backing they receive - will make the replacement director think twice about coming back, and they'll need to find a new screenwriting team.
They could possibly think, ""That's fine, we'll just do the galaxy-spanning stuff with the Fantastic Four"", but FF is going to be a tough enough sell without painting it as a GotG replacement.
Whatever they decide, the very first thing they should do in terms of damage control is hold their hands up and say, ""We got played. We're not perfect; we made a mistake, and for that we apologise. We're aware of what we did, and we hope to move on made wiser by the experience.""

two things: the first is that Wonder Woman was mediocre and you know it. Wonder Woman as the mediocre love child of Captain America the first avenger and Thor  crib noted by Patty Jenkins. The movie benefited by timing and demand. People wanted a Female led comic book movie that didn't suck like past entries. It was a mile stone because it didn't suck. That doesn't mean it was great but in comparison to its predecessors it's a milestone. That milestone is predicated on a double standard which Wonder Woman benefited greatly from. It wasn't judged the same way as its male counter part because you had people singing the praises of strong female representation at last Despite past strong female characters like Rippley or Sarah Conner, or Buffy and Xena who was basically Wonder Woman. People clamored for it because they were afraid that if it didn't do well it would be another 20 years before we saw another. Critics didn't properly do their job for fear  that if they negatively critiqued it they would be labeled as anti feminist and sexist . Now if you like it that is cool but honestly I can't understand how someone like you who does such a thorough dissemination of movies can miss or overlook the fact that wonder woman was crib notes captain america and thor that had a schizophrenic tone with contradictory messages.

"Yeah, gotta say you nailed it, although as you pointed out it wasn't much of a challenge.

Swear to god, the thing that gets me about those wastes of oxygen is that they are the biggest titanic, colossal BORES on the planet. _All_ they're doing is whining endlessly about how everything in the goddam world isn't tailored exclusively to their tastes.

But in terms of subversion, the only film I ever watched where I realised gender stereotypes had been subverted was Annihalation. nd that was simple. About halfway through the movie I was thoroughly engaged in, I realised...Oh! The whole cast for most of this is female. And once I realised that, It bothered me no less than when i'd been watching it previously.

"See another thing I don't think Disney realized is that not only have the ruined their reputation with fans but they've ruined their relationship with directors. The reason I don't think any director has picked this up and why there haven't been any announcements is because I don't think any directors trust Disney. Disney showed they'll fire people at the drop of a hat. Not to mention, a lot of people side with James and probably wouldn't want to step on his toes. Guardians was his baby. Plus, if someone has a vendetta against a certain director, they'll go through their twitter and try to pull what the trolls did to James. If Disney doesn't react in kind, they'll be called hypocrites.

I do love Disney. I love many of the animated films and I have enjoyed the MCU but let's be honest, this was going to happen sooner or later.

EDIT:  Can't also help but sense the irony of left-wing fans defending Gunn and saying this is going to blow up in Disney's face, while also saying that you should ignore right-wing fans of Star Wars because those hardcore fans who get upset over stuff like this is such a small percentage of those who watch them.

The idea that half of video is based on: that Disney is the company that will give artists a voice, and that we can trust with our favorite IPs goes out the fuckin' window if you aren't happy with Star Wars.

"You bring up an interesting point about the value of symbols. I've struggled with the symbols I value all my life. 

Let me ask you something. How would you feel if you were wearing an ""I'm With Her Hat"" and someone felt like they had the right to assault you out of the self delusion that the ""Her"" in reference was the biblical Whore of Babylon? How would you feel if you were dealing with someone who believed that you were literally trying to bring about the rise of the Anti Christ? They refuse to even acknowledge the possibility that you are anything else. And they believe they have both the right and the responsibility to punish you for it.They claim that they know the inner workings of your mind. And no matter what you say, no matter what proof you can show them that they are as wrong, some how, some way, you are evil. And you need to be punished.

Now imagine that these people have the support of colleges and the news at large. There are entire mobs of these people marching through your streets with mask on. They set cars on fire. They beat people in the street. They abuse their own children for disagreeing. They talk about how evil you are in on every award show. The police are punished for protecting you. And, again, all of this is based on the delusions of some fucking asshole who will not pull his head far enough out of his ass to see you as a human being. 

How would you feel if somebody imposed their own interpretation on your symbol? 

There are people who feel that the the Confederate flag is a racist symbol. Even (or especially) people who see value in secession see the Confederate flag and anyone who flies it as nothing but racist. This sentiment is identical to the belief that the Gay Pride flag and anyone who flies it represents child molestation. The fact that there are genuinely racist people who fly my flag doesn't make it a hate symbol any more than child molesters who fly the Pride flag make it a symbol of child molestation. My Confederate flag means Southern pride and the power of the people over their government. It's our flag. It means what it means to us. I refuse to care what others think.",0,0,2018-08-25T02:01:09.000Z,Aaron Chandler,UCX4IFg_Gw38yvNspW83DzIg,_9iab0z6Kyg,True,UgyVFq2MoFcyk3feFV14AaABAg

"Bob, let me begin by thanking you for showing your humanity. You should do it more often. It would be therapeutic for you and your audience. Probably grow it quite a bit too. Here's the thing though. First, stop saying Nazi, you're making the word meaningless. When I hear ""Nazi"" now I don't think ""fascist with genocidal intent"" I think ""person with ideas and proposals you have no defense against, combined with a paranoid notion of some greater conspiracy communicated via dogwhistles only the enlightened can understand."" It's not a good look.

You know what, I want to live in a world where James Gunn wasn't fired. Sadly, that isn't the world we live in. All in all his removal is equitable. I know you like to draw Rosanne parallels, but look beyond that to other firings and removals. I don't care if someone was a literal Nazi, that should have no bearing on their ability to work in media. So long as they are not actively calling for the violent elimination of one or more groups through their media work, someone's personal beliefs should never be a consideration in the distribution, publication, etc. of their media.

Sadly we don't live in that world. Instead things are becoming more and more politically charged. I've seen people like you wait with baited breath during a developing crisis. Almost literally praying this is something they can turn to their political advantage, and calculating how to sweep it under the rug if it isn't. In this world, Gunn's firing is fair. It doesn't matter who dug it up or what underhanded methods were used. (Sterling and Hogan's racist recordings were both illegally made, for example), it doesn't matter if they'd already apologized, or if there are other mitigating circumstances. You can't switch this monster you helped create on and off based on how you think someone voted in the last election. So his firing Gunn is what fair looks like in this crazy world of ours then I'm for it, but I don't like it. If you don't like it either we can work to dismantle it, but I also won't help you try to cordon off people you think shouldn't be touched by it while others are left out in the cold. 

I'd like to close with a sub rant about apologies. Let's talk about Sarah Silverman and James Gunn. They both do a little thing I like to call ladder kicking. Both Gunn and Silverman made their early bones doing some very very offensive stuff. Personally, I love very, very, offensive stuff. Both of them have since ""disavowed"" at lot of this earlier stuff. At least in Gunn's case he can't be all the repentant because he gave Kauffman a cameo in the first Guardians movie. But those apologies seem worse than hollow because they are, in effect trying to deny up and coming creatives the opportunities they used to develop themselves. I'd liken it to Joseph Kennedy making is fortune via insider trading, then promptly cracking down on the very methods he used to acquire his personal wealth when he became SEC Chairman. Massive hypocrisy to benefit ones self and the expense of others.",0,0,2018-08-24T23:00:45.000Z,Grumplebee Abee,UCoFHixmzUOGFdR24cv4FVpQ,xQ7cEJNAuIA,True,UgyLfm8cZe1T2X0snxt4AaABAg

I disagree with Bob's opinions on politics almost entirely and his opinions on movies and social justice equally so, but this was a compelling story even though it's true. 

I can't agree even on his opinion on Passion. It's a gore-fest that pointlessly indulges in the physical sufferings of Jesus even though theologically they aren't the crux (pardon the pun) of the story., But you can't say that the narrative isn't compelling when the entirety of western culture is a product of this narrative. Personal preference is not an objective standard to judge a story by. And the point about extra-biblical material is moot because every form of Christianity has to interpret and piece together the four gospels into a single narrative and before the age of reformation extra-biblical witness and tradition was always part of all interpretation.

"This is the problem with outrage based vigilantism online in general, it's somewhat uncontrollable and disturbingly indiscriminate.

For the sake of clarifying my position, I don't know James Gunn as a person and haven't heard any extra evidence to support the notion of these tweets being anything more than just edgy humour and so while I can understand why Disney would choose to fire him in response to such a public outrage I disagree with the decision and would not be opposed to him being rehired (provided that no evidence comes to light of any actual wrongdoing on his part).

Onto the point I want to make though, if you have called for anyone in the past to lose their job over words they've said, beliefs they've held or political positions they've taken (in other words, things that are also not crimes or harming anyone) then you are a hypocrite if you oppose the firing of James Gunn, since that is exactly the course of action you've been condoning for people just now being applied to someone you actually care about and you don't get to suddenly start crying 'this has all gone too far' when the bile and vitriol you've been spraying on everyone else suddenly splashes back and hits you.

The reason people on the right are likely leading the charge against Gunn and don't seem so sympathetic to his situation is likely because it has for the most part been the left that have been wielding this sort of behaviour like a bludgeon against others, I don't say this to defend or condone those spurring this on, I say this because this incident has hopefully opened people's eyes as to why this kind of social media witch-hunting is ridiculous and needs to stop, yes, even if it's targeted at people you don't like or disagree with.",0,0,2018-08-24T20:48:14.000Z,Marker 91,UCrJZKnE7RS1GQrhUATCdDPg,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,Ugwi6cCcQn7EoIgx6K14AaABAg

It enjoyed broad support from Church leaders across denominations precisely because it was felt to be a faithful adaptation, and most support includes the note that they did not feel it promoted anti-Semitism, nor did they think it should have.""

"I enjoyed this and was unaware of the prior James Gunn interview along with a general fandom of his work; it certainly helped contextualize your reaction to his termination from the Walt Disney/Marvel Studio. I agree it's a giant manipulation by a vocal minority that I don't agree with since I'm in the mindset of ""you're a big corporation that convinces people your movies are available for limited times to rake in stupid loads of money while dictating to them how to feel or think regarding your products; you've never cared about what people thought so long as you were making money"" regarding Disney so it makes no sense given they can see how quickly people forget anything with the right amount of time passing (1 week to 6 months at most) in the internet age. I found the story of your early days very interesting and your opinions on Passion and Scooby Doo 2 very similar to my own. 
Regarding the Passion - Myself and my step father were forced to go with the 2 free tickets provided so our souls could be saved. We walked out laughing and made fun of that horrible film. It made our relationship better as that was about the closest thing to a connection we shared up to that point. So that may be weird, but yes, it was simply a bad film. 
Scooby Doo 2 - I didn't see the first in theaters or home video. Heard it was awful and I didn't like the trailer. People I talked too (other than 1 person I knew) hated it. I went and saw this as I just wanted to go to some movie and I really enjoyed it for what it was.

"Full Disclosure - I haven't finished the video yet (I'm around the 16:00 mark), but I just wanted to jump in here.

I've been a private security guard. I know things are a little different in the northeast, at least from my limited experience working with security guards formerly from that region. I don't have any personal experience there, my realms have been the southeast and the mountain west. But, I don't think being part of the private security field is necessarily a red flag. I agree with some of the other statements made that there were some things going on with that dude that are a bit off. But, I know a lot of people who went into private security because there just aren't a lot of good entry-level opportunities for job placement fresh out of the military, unless you had a high demand MOS or something else that translates really well into the civilian world (like electrician or MP).

A lot of veterans do it to get some experience in a job that often falls right into their laps.

"10:34    It is factually incorrect that James Gunn ever apologized for the full extent of his pedophile jokes, photos and tweets back in 2012. Here's what went down: In 2012, He got called out by GLAAD and TheMarySue.com for a 2011 blog post on his website, titled ""The 50 Superheroes You Most Want to Have Sex With"", where he made homophobic and sexist jokes. He apologized to the LGBT community with the following statement:
""A couple of years ago I wrote a blog that was meant to be satirical and funny. In rereading it over the past day I don't think it's funny.  The attempted humor in the blog does not represent my actual feelings. However, I can see where statements were poorly worded and offensive to many.  I'm sorry and regret making them at all.  People who are familiar with me as evidenced by my Facebook page and other mediums know that I'm an outspoken proponent for the rights of the gay and lesbian community,  women and anyone who feels disenfranchised, and it kills me that some other outsider like myself, despite his or her gender or sexuality, might feel hurt or attacked by something I said. We're all in the same camp, and I want to do my best to make this world a better place for all of us. I'm learning all the time. I promise to be more careful with my words in the future. And I will do my best to be funnier as well. Much love to all. -- James Gunn.""
As you can see he only references the blog post he was caught posting, and never admits to or apologizes for the dozens of pedophile tweets or the photos.  Fans like you are trying to repurpose that specific statement into a catch all apology for every offensive thing he's ever done, and that's dishonest.   Never apologizing and owning up to things not known to the general movie going public  is not ""water under the bridge"". Shouldn't he at some point in his career have had to publicly apologize to anyone whose ever been a victim of childhood abuse or rape?  I think so.

"Youtube yet again showed this comment on the trending...but these comments are giving me such a headache. So if you believe Gunn should be fired your a nazi and if not your a pedo? Give me a break.

Here's what I think: they are _both_ wrong. Gunn should have been fired and Cern clearly wanted to watch a career crash and burn and it turns out the person in question was a piece of shit anyways, so he got lucky. I don't like alt-righters, or white-supremacists, or whatever the hell he is, all are pieces of shit anyways. If he wasn't an alt-righter with a shady motive, nobody would care, or rather it's convient that he is because you can use that as an excuse to have some kind of arguement to get Gunn back, so I guess now Gunn is the ""hero"" and Cern is a Nazi, because you need people to rally behind you to get that part 3, it's really important you have that trilogy of course!



Why should I care about Gunn btw? Boo freaking hoo he's getting fired for writing tweets about...pedophilla? If you read those tweets, saw the way it was written and you still want him to be rehired and are still attempting to twist this into a freedom of speech thing than something is definitely wrong with you, no matter the person who brought it to light was. There's no need to check the facts after reading those tweets, it's clear as day it was no joke even if he pretended it was, it's all there in front of you. His tweets had not an air of a joking tone, were not slightly funny, he even linked explicit content at one point and it was in first person, nor was it news relevant, and we can all unite in saying Pedos deserve no platform to speak or spread their inhumane ideologies. 



And if it wasn't Cern it would be someone else. Let's be real you only care because you care more about a part 3 than pedophilla smh, and I know for a fact I'm getting hate for that one because most of you are liking this video and watching a fucking hour video ( I did not ) in support of this for this very reason. When it's your favorite movie, and potential child abuse separates you from the movie, suddenly your morals are flexible and that becomes an obstacle, freaking hypocrites. Morals mean nothing if you want your part three of course! And you lot pretend to be on higher ground, spouting shit like hating alt-right and labelling the other side a nazi when any given topic other than movies you'd jump right on their bandwagon and support them wholeheartedly, especially for issues like immigration!!! The only ones who will be offended by this are the ones who will definitely be pissed off underneath this comment, and I don't really mind. It doesn't matter what movie, people's endless desires today is bending the morals of our society to fit their own whims and wants and its making room for things that a year ago we would have easily agreed was wrong.

"Sorry Bob, gotta disagree here. I'm pretty left leaning and from the UK, but your argument doesn't really hold up imo. You seem to be against this purely based on the people involved. However, the societal rules have been set - these things can come back to bite you. IMO, these things should never be sackable offenses except in cases where the person directly reference their employer in the tweets. But, if some people are getting sacked, everyone has to be held to the same 'rules'. Unfortunately, some of the left in america had right-leaning people sacked for offensive jokes (whether the jokes are actually funny is irrelevant) and this has set precedent. As such, when it gets applied to everyone, Gunn is at risk.

"This is bullshit!  The idea that Alan Horn can't admit to his mistakes because he might get passed over for his promotion is a stupid, ridiculous, out-dated view on ""strength"" that very few who are successful in big business truly believe, but for dumb-ass reasons, it still persists because nobody is brave enough to test it.  We all know that admitting to your mistakes, showing you've learned from them and moving on are desirable traits and that denying you ever make mistakes is a trait that needs to be stamped out - and Alan Horn is at the top of the pyramid, he also retired once already and has no reason to give a shit about his career at this point.  He literally has nothing a man in his position can fear.  There is no reason whatsoever that the man can be so retarded and cowardly at the same time as to refuse to just own up to having had a knee-jerk reaction, yet here we are - his behaviour would suggest that he is exactly that, so I question how he was ever deemed capable enough to make it to his position in the first place.

"Reminds me a bit of Kevin Smith getting into controversies with religious people over his films. 

The big difference, of course, being that Kevin doesn't have billions of dollars riding on his films being a success or even studio bigwigs gambling their professional reputation. 

But it would have been so fun to see James Gunn or Disney taking the piss out of the alt-right like how Kevin did with Dogma and Red State.

 I don't remember which film it was that was protested a lot until the distributor was changed. The protestors claimed a victory and Kevin was left confused ""but the film is still having a wide release?"" . Ok.  It might be nigh impossible for disney heads to stand in protesting lines with big sparkly signs ironically protesting their own product. Or even shuffling the release onto a subsidiary so the Disney logo wasn't on the start. Even letting Gunn work and releasing it under a ""Alan Smithee"" monicker is probably too unlikely. But at least something to show them that they weren't pushovers would have been fun to see.

But the longer they wait, the longer the cement of the decision gets to harden.

"Bob i get that your a big marvel and James Gunn fan, but him being removed is completely reasonable. Disney is largely a company for children, they don't want the word pedophilia any where in the ball park of anything associated with them. They are probably just jokes but if it came out that James Gunn was a pedo it would fuck the MCU into the dirt. The most profitable movie franchise and most valuable property owned by Disney would be toast. James Gunn is not the only man on the planet that can handle the Guardians of the Galaxy. If your a fan of comics you know properties by tons of different story tellers. It's a quirky space opera with a good sound track they can find a guy or gal. Disney isn't gonna make a fuck the alt right statement.

The fights we face today are not now, nor have they often truly been, won by grassroots movements made of grassroots individuals simply standing up to do what's right. The civil rights of non-male, non-whites were not won when a black woman spontaneously decided she was going to sit at the front of the bus that day, come hell or high water. They were won by organized, subversive groups of activists, willing to die for their cause, who strategically worked the social discourse by maneuvering the enemies of equality and progress into positions where - at the end of the day - even they had to ask, ""Are we the bad guys?""

You want to do something about the decaying state of this nation? About the slip backwards through history? Don't boycott and don't bother attending scheduled, city-council approved, mainstream protests. Join/build an underground, subversive group.

"Outrage culture is not saving people from dangerous the alt-right or the alt-left are talking about. Not everyone is a pedophile nor is everyone a racist, but the outrage makes people lose their job and their co-workers living in fear of suffering the same fate, even for being innocent. 

Secondly, most disturbingly, outrage culture demands immediate punishment for a perceived transgression WITHOUT the involvement of the justice system. Companies are now forced to serve as the investigator, judge and jury for every case the public deems outrageous.  Since their main goal is profit and image, they won't be concerned with justice but profit. Thus, like in the case of James Gunn, they fired him even though there was no trial, no proof of paedophilia allegatoons, despite his previous apologies and despite the cast support. Just to save face.

Or look at the Roseanne controversy. She said something that could have been interpreted as racist, although she claims she believed that the person in question was white. Instead of sending her to court and conducting an investigation or her get fined erc, no, the studio decided to circumvent the jurisdictional system, ignoring the possibility of conduct justice and rather save their own face. 
And instead of dealing with Roseanna's misconduct on an individual level, they canceled a finished show before it aired resulting in all the people (actors, producers, editors, screenwriters etc.) losing their job or creating a significant gap in their CV. Basically all the time and work and money that went into the show and all the people on the project have nothing to show for. They can't even mention being part of it because of the stigma  involved. Imagine you working as a part of a team for 2 years and lose everything over night because of 1 stupid ill-advised tweet.

"Let me get this straight. Gunn has the right politics, so he was ATTACKED by a RELENTLESS ALT-RIGHT GASLIGHTING CAMPAIGN to SILENCE HIS PROGRESSIVE VOICE?

It's not this disturbing weapon you far-left progressives created and put all this power behind. It's not the insane level of progressivism now enforced almost across the board in every institution of power. It's not this social order wherein we've totally stopped paying attention to context or intent because we're so concerned with the miniscule details of how we think things like jokes and microaggressions affect everyone on a massive scale and empower evil people to believe their evil BS more (frankly you're doing that right now, just for a different flavor of evil). No, rather than any of those things, it's the people who are now directing the light back at you in an attempt to get you to realize the monster you've created. We have to keep slaughtering innocents, just not the innocents we personally like and agree with most, huh?

And your characterization of the people who did this to Gunn... are you so sure about that? Do you really presume that not a single person was shown what Gunn said and legitimately found it disturbing and unfitting for someone in his position regardless of what he's said on it since? How do you know the context and intent of the people who dug up those old tweets? You've been passing that on like it's a fact but never gave out even the slightest grain of evidence. I wouldn't be surprised at all if you don't have evidence. Seems to me you love to assign this kind of intent when it helps you fit things into your 'left good, right bad' box.

Stop trying to slap the blame on the people who are using your own tactics against you. Evidence frankly doesn't even matter, because if you just think about it, ANYONE can use what these people did to take down anyone who's ever tried being funny online. If this happened to Gunn, it can happen to anyone. You have to dismantle the weapon. You can't just make it not effective for the people you don't like, because it simply does not work that way. And do you really believe it's worth it to stand behind these tactics? Look inward at yourself and really ask, if what Gunn said was not worth what he now faces, are you being consistent in your application of your own principles? Or do you simply move the goalpost whenever it's convenient to your personal narrative?

And frankly, your whole concept of 'don't ever let these people make progress in what they want, ever', at around 6:30... Jesus, dude. I'll admit, I had to stop before 7:00. I guess if we're playing Secret Communist except with white supremacists now, have fun destroying the fabric of civilization and turning the entire western world into paranoid lunatics. I'll just be over here in the ever-shrinking bin of people who are still capable of trusting someone to not be secretly hiding genocidal urges. You absolute maniac.

"I'll never understand the idea of saving face by pretending you didn't fuck up when you know that you did. If you make a huge error in judgement and, when called on it, admit your mistake and take measures to correct its consequences, then you've given people one reason to think you're an idiot. If you make a huge error in judgement and, when called on it, refuse to admit it was a mistake at all, you've given people TWO good reasons to think you're an idiot. How is that less professionally embarrassing? I know it's generally accepted that it is--politics, too, HATES people who learn from their mistakes--but why?

I hope you're right that they won't go beyond the usual trickery due to people being less prone to falling for it. If people are smart enough to recognize when a company is secretly going back on a dumb decision behind the scenes, they're also smart enough to recognize that the decision was a bad one in the first place and ought not to be upheld anyway, and that pretending to stand by it is at least a smarter and more morally appropriate choice than actually standing by it.

Everyone makes mistakes. Given enough opportunities to make decisions, even really stupid blunders will happen to everyone. The measure of whether someone should be trusted to make important decisions is not whether they can avoid making huge errors in judgement, but how readily they learn from and correct their mistakes once pointed out. Someone who will hold to a wrong decision simply because it was their own decision cannot be trusted to make important decisions.",0,0,2018-08-18T00:39:57.000Z,David Dewar,UCbg58CNhQk7jOoodWAXJ-lA,RdkYCpQ2TNY,True,UgxKlMBLqDWMrsTc_u14AaABAg

Batman V. Superman was just a mess through and through; building up a franchise it clearly doesn't deserve, having overly contrived plot-points that doesn't make much sense (even with the Extended Cut), and the fact DC was trying to play catch-up to Marvel in a rushed way.
Suicide Squad, while I did like it then and stand by liking it now, I admit that it's highly flawed and suffers from tonal whiplash.

This is where things get complicated because social media sites may not realize there are trolls trying to fire someone or they may let it happen so social media gets more attention. after all, with big stories on their site, people are reinforced to come back. Cant really know. Regardless, since social media platforms control what does and does not get to be on their site, they have a strong measure of control over what you are allowed to say and what you cannot say. in the future it is more likely you will have your posts taken down, be banned, or even fired as companies start associating more with social media than ever before. this may be ""just a career setback of a wealthy white man..."" but the implications can potentially be far reaching and devastating as far as free speech goes.",0,0,2018-08-17T21:28:15.000Z,Jeremy Fredde,UC8py8CcjtedSPYoHnzCNABg,RdkYCpQ2TNY,True,Ugy3HPR9EeW9gdIC74h4AaABAg

"Ok, so I don't really have anywhere else to discuss this, so I'll speak my piece here...

(After I say that I really appreciate you, Bob, and love your work!)

So, first of all, yes, fuck the nazi alt-right douche-nozzles who are attempting to silence dissenting voices in this proto-fascist administration we're suffering through right now. Their tactics are shitty, their ends are indefensible and they are reprehensible monsters who deserve no victories or support.

However... no, don't fucking rehire James Gunn.

Because at the end of the day, Disney did exactly what they were supposed to do, and expecting them to do anything different is not only ridiculous, but also kind of entitled and gross. Disney is Disney because of their truly masterful superpower of Brand Management, and this has been consistent for fucking decades. So when the high-profile director of one of their largest franchises is now being associated in the press with some very bad words like ""pedophilia"" and ""rape,"" and those associations have actual, tangible records of being said by this person (no matter how long ago, or in what context or how much he apologized for them, which yes, he did), then fuck yes, fire him. Don't let him make any more of your kids movies. The source of the re-introduction of this material into the public eye is, as far as Gunn's employment is concerned, completely unimportant. If you're Disney, you ABSOLUTELY fire that guy.

Now, were these tweets really THAT bad? Well... yeah, they're pretty shitty jokes to make, and the excuse that ""oh, everyone was trying to be edgy back then"" or ""uhh, South Park makes worse jokes all the time"" are deflections of the sort the right constantly uses to excuse gross behavior and, c'mon y'all, we better than that. Gunn said some stupid shit, put it on the internet, left it there, and now there are consequences for it. 

Now, I feel it's important to note that this perspective is actually upheld by Gunn himself, in one of the classiest apologies I've ever read from a public figure. Gunn recognized that it was a long time ago and that he's changed a great deal from the gross edgelord he used to be (a statement which I, personally, believe completely), but he also takes responsibility for his actions of years ago and owns up to the consequences like a fucking adult. No whining, no excuses, no beef, and that earns mad respect from me. Here's a dude who is truly mature and knows how to own his mistakes.

That doesn't mean he should get his job back making children's movies (and yes they are, dammit). 

Gunn is gonna be fine. Homeboy is rich af, a great talent and was (half of) the mastermind behind one of the biggest surprise franchise successes in movie history. He can do whatever he wants now... except work at Disney, because yeah, they don't want the ""kid rape"" guy making flicks for them. As unfair as that label might be, it's there and he did bring it on himself, years ago. 

And finally... listen, I want to burn the alt-right to the ground as much as the next freedom-loving, scared as shit POC parent, but desperately defending the rich white guy for making jokes about child rape? That seems like a weird hill to decide to die on...",0,0,2018-08-17T16:18:02.000Z,CaseyJustice,UC4s52VjpDRx0B56foiMW3Ag,RdkYCpQ2TNY,True,UgyJcyvqhu-_9cDlYz14AaABAg

"First, I had no idea Escapist was even still kicking. wow.
Second, congrats on the Big Picture.

Third, there is a lot of inaccurate information surrounding this story that should be clarified for your viewers. Here are some common statements I've heard repeated on multiple channels and podcasts...

1. ""Everyone knew about these tweets already, they've been public for years"" - While there are a lot of people who follow Gunn extensively on social media, there is a silent majority that does not. I, for example, had no idea about Gunn's tweets or previous blog posts until this story broke. Even after the story broke, many channels and podcasts seemed to gloss over the details of Gunn's jokes in favor of defending him. I had to do my own research to find out specifically what he posted and was pretty shocked by what I read.

2. ""Gunn apologized for the tweets long ago - multiple times!"" -- Gunn never apologized for the offensive tweets in question prior to his termination. In November 2012, Gunn was forced to apologize for some offensive blog posts that he made on his personal website. In the one inciting blog post, Gunn wrote that he enjoyed hearing a story about a monkey ejaculating on a boy. In other blog posts, Gunn made comments that he wanted to sodomize certain underage comic book characters (such as Kitty Pride and X23) (and yes, he even acknowledged they were underage). His apology in 2012 did not address the pedophilic tweets from 2009 and 2010 that were recently discovered.

3. ""No one really cared about those jokes back then"" -- The entire reason why James was forced to make an apology in 2012 was because his ""nasty jokes"" came under scrutiny by the general public just two months after he was announced to write and direct GotG. There was public backlash on social media regarding his sexist and pedophilic blog posts. But, again, this backlash was focused on the blog posts, and not on the 2009/2010 tweets. I don't think the majority really knew about those posts (because not everyone has the desire or time to dig through 20k tweets out of morbid curiosity). Of course there was no upset here because there was no awareness about the existence of even worse tweets from before 2012.

4. ""Gunn stopped making those comments all on his own, this was in the past."" -- Gunn's apology in 2012 actually only came two months after he was announced by Disney to write and direct GotG. In the years, months, and days leading up to the apology, he was still making sexist, misogynistic, and pedophilic comments on his blog and on twitter. Gunn never took it upon himself to own the disgusting comments and apologize for it. He apologized only after he drew negative attention from the public. So while he did eventually tone down, it is inaccurate that he did this ""on his own"". This was not on his own. If you truly believe Alan Horn (of all people) knew about the 2009 tweets, then you have to believe that Gunn absolutely had a stern talking to in 2012 about his behavior when he was forced to apologize due to the negative media attention surrounding similar posts.

5. ""Gunn changed his behavior afterward"" -- About that... Just a month after his apology in 2012, Gunn made another tweet that had underlying pedophilic tones in which he said """"Eagle Snatches Kid"" is what I call it when I get lucky."" And if you're not convinced that this may have been an inappropriate tweet to make just weeks after he apologized for his blog posts, then you should know that the comment was in reference to a hoax video called ""eagle snatches kid"" in which cam footage shows an eagle swooping down to snatch a toddler. The fact that Gunn even joked about feeling lucky to snatch a child is uncomfortable, but it becomes a full blown party foul when you remember his extensive twitter and blog post history around pedophilia. In addition to the Eagle tweet, he also made a couple tweets in November of 2012 (the same month he apologized), one in which he said R Kelly's Trapped in the Closet was the second best video after the one where he urinates on a child. While I agree that Gunn seemed to have matured quickly after the success of GotG, he definitely didn't change right away.

6. ""His tweets were over 10 years ago"" -- Actually, James continued to make inappropriate and offensive tweets and posts as recently as 2012 (6 years ago). While it's true that the recent center of attention was on tweets made from 2009 and 2010 (still not 10 years ago), too many people have been given the false impression that James' terrible humor was isolated to just that time period, which is incorrect.

7. ""Alan Horn absolutely knew about those tweets for years."" -- While none of us can say with 100% certain whether Alan Horn knew about the tweets, it wouldn't make any sense if he did. When Gunn apologized in 2012 for his offensive blog posts, he also deleted them. You'll notice that shortly after (but not immediately so), he also toned down his disturbed sense of humor. The fact that Gunn deleted the posts in question and also restrained further comments tells me he was probably given ""the talk"" by Kevin Feige (aka encouraged to clean up to avoid further scandal). Hell, let's assume Alan Horn himself talked to Gunn about the behavior. Do you seriously believe that Alan Horn and Kevin Feige knew about the tweets, told Gunn to delete his blog posts but said ""nah, the tweets are cool""? That doesn't make sense. Disney already had a firestorm on its hands in 2012 when Gunn was first announced due to his brand of humor, and there's no way the people with the most to lose from bad press wouldn't do everything in their power to prevent any future negative press the minute they were made aware of it. Again, we can't say with 100% certainty whether Alan Horn knew about the 2009 or 2010 tweets, but it sure as hell doesn't make sense if he was aware of the tweets back in 2012 and chose not to have Gunn remove them when Gunn removed his blog posts for similar concerns.

8. ""This only happened because of a alt-right political gaslighting campaign and Disney fell victim to it."" -- No one is to blame for what Gunn wrote except himself. It doesn't matter why Gunn's tweets resurfaced or who retweeted them. The fact of the matter is, Gunn wrote them... he willfully made those comments and even after he apologized for some of his discovered blog posts, he never apologized for his tweets and certainly never made an attempt to delete his tweets. As I pointed out in (4), he technically continued making comments for a brief period after the incident which shows that he actually had not learned his lesson. I would say he likely didn't get the wake up call until GotG was a huge success. At the end of the day, Gunn is responsible for his actions and we can't blame anyone else for what he chose to say regardless of how long ago they were.

9. ""This is bullshit that Alan Horn doesn't want to rehire James Gunn. He got played. He made a stupid decision!"" -- The way the situation has been described to viewers by many channels has given people a false impression that Disney made a mistake. Disney did not make a mistake. Considering Gunn already had an incident in 2012, Disney had no choice but to remove him. To your own point about Roseanne, Bob, this was Gunn's second chance... Maybe Disney could have tried to pull what CN did for Dan Harmon to squash the outcry, but I think it wouldn't have likely saved Gunn. Considering this, it's incredibly unfair to be mad at Alan Horn about this. Alan has to consider the negative impact to the brand by defending and protecting James Gunn over pedophilic tweets.

"Maybe I'm a bit late to this discussion, but my concern is that these type of instances will continue. At least until a time where companies begin to properly consider how they respond to pressure and discussion on social media. A precedent has already been set by numerous organisations that anything an individual has posted, old or new can be used against, and that said organisations have left them out to dry on each occasion.

Furthermore time and time again social media has demonstrated how it can be an effective tool to turbo franchise the voices of vocal minorities, both good and bad, noble or not. Which brings the unfortunate concern that there is no way to address these issues without taking into account the ways social media has been utilised in this way as a whole.

If we argue that past use of social media can not be used against someone in there current posting, that rule would have to apply to everyone and vice versa and frustratingly people are aware of this and use it to there advantage.

The alt-right to some degree is emulating the actions of the most extreme side of the Liberal left who in turn see what the alt right is doing in turn their logic against them, who then react to what their doing and so on and so forth.

"MovieBob, if you're going to have a long form video with 99% talking head footage with nothing relevant to the video visually, please don't have text slides. Either make it an audio podcast-like video, or make it an audio-video project completely. I hate listening to this in my car and suddenly hearing no speaking, glancing down, and seeing a wall of text I can't read while driving.

Stick with one format: make a video, with interesting and relevant visuals, or keep it text only, please. If you have something to add to the movie after the main recording session, don't be lazy by just typing it up. Either go back to shoot it, or publish a link to the text in the description. Disrupting the video with a black and white sign saying ""hey I have more to say but I'm too lazy to go back and produce that content properly"" is a bad sign.

"Gadsby brought this to Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and it was well received, because experimental blurring the lines between theatre-spoken word and comedy happen there with a gleefully monotonous regularity.
Perhaps it's because I've spent 15 years working the Fringe as a theatre and comedy critic that this left me utterly underwhelmed. It's all artifice. Gadsby's opening routine isn't particularly new, innovative, or even very funny (which seems intentional) and when the ""hammer falls"" as it were, it doesn't seem much of a surprise. Indeed, and with the best of will to Gadsby, my first thought on hearing that she was quitting comedy was that it wasn't much of a loss to the art form.

Now I quite accept that most people don't have the opportunity to see as much experimental stand-up and spoken word performance as I have, but this really is being blown up as revolutionary ONLY because it skipped straight from the comedy circuit to Netflix and because a well intentioned cadre of the media, and op-ed writers (and youtubers) made a huge deal about how it has ""changed stand up forever"".

Speaking as someone who knows better... it really hasn't.

Oh and on the subject of Gadsby ""giving up comedy"", she had another show planned for this year's Fringe, and has called it off... not because she gave up on comedy, but because after Nanette, she's too busy to fly to Scotland, because she has too many comedy shows lined up elsewhere.

"Yay, I have a reason to go back to the Escapist now. I hope this does not affect your Geek.Com Reviews. I am sure that the videos will be less frequent. Be careful about overlapping InBoBWeTrust vs Big Picture. Sounds like you have good management now, but managements change and legalese gets really, nasty when websites want to retro-actively claim content, so just... So keep your butt covered and try to avoid overlap.

As for the James Gunn business, my sentiment is the same as last time. For what little my little scroll of letters on a YouTube video matters. Folks, keep bitching, make it apparent that the astro-turfing trolls of the world do not out-number the amount of people ready to go to the mat for real-outrage. Even if Gunn does not get back, at least leave enough of an impression so the fake-troll-outrage never works on Disney again.

On both sides, and I love that Bob seems completely unaware, or is fully aware but just doesn't care, that this is a tactic that the right is co-opting, which the left has been using for probably at least the last five years, if not the full last decade, if not even longer. But it is 100% bullshit when people I agree with do it, and it is 100% bulshit when people I don't agree with do it, which is what is called being consistent, and unbiased, which is something the left in general isn't very familiar with. But who cares about consistency when there's Nazis to fight right? We need to suspend such childish Notions for the sake of fighting against a great evil, an evil which we must defeat at any cost, by any means, right?

"A problem with replacing Gunn is: *What director wants to become the next bad guy in this story?* You could compare it to all the crap Peyton Reed got after he replaced Edgar Wright on 'Ant-Man', but at least Wright left of his own accord. Here, we have a director ousted from a project he poured a lot of incredibly personal creative energy into for what can charitably be called controversial reasons. The movies' cast has come out in support of him. Kevin Feige appeared to have his back. Other people in Hollywood with no apparent connection to the 'GotG' movies or the overall MCU (e.g Selma Blair and Bobcat Goldthwaite) also support him. Then there are the critics and fans who also would want Gunn reinstated as director. And keep in mind - we're living in a time when energetic online fanbases are already discouraging directors from getting involved with superhero and ""nerd""-adjacent properties (i.e McQuarrie after someone floated the idea of him director Henry Cavill in a 'Superman' movie).

Given all that, who would *want* to take on this project? To show up on set knowing everyone involved doesn't think they should be there, and nobody but Alan Horn is going to have their back. Any deviation from Gunn's script/original plan is tantamount to sacrilege. They'll be seen as crossing a picket line. They'll be accused of enabling the alt-right trolls who got Gunn fired in the first place. Almost certainly, it will not be long before they're harassed off social media. For anyone who takes on the thankless task of directing 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' in Gunn's place, it will likely be a black mark on their career, and perhaps an outright career-ender for anyone who isn't established enough in Hollywood to weather this storm.",165,46,2018-08-17T03:53:26.000Z,Janootz,UC1QV0LVGZTdJbHK2s8Ac1zA,RdkYCpQ2TNY,True,UgyCAhf4iS-lfn_Op994AaABAg
"You kind of lost me with your last video with your, ""If you read these tweets, the Nazis win!"" argument. The biggest issue with that approach is that the internet is now full of people who have no idea what James Gunn actually posted, when he posted it, how he replied when caught, and whether he stopped when caught.

The actual timeline is that James Gunn was posting pedo jokes to his twitter in early December of 2012, a year after he had apologized for posting transphobic, misogynist, and homophobic material to his blog and GLAAD caught him. That means he not only said, ""Sorry for being an asshat,"" he then continued to be an asshat for a whole other year. But at this point he had already been hired by Disney, so he was literally posting pedo jokes while working on Guardians of the Galaxy.

The fact that Disney didn't realize he was such a douche is a problem. But them deciding to cut ties with him belatedly after everyone else figured out he was a douche isn't the worst criminal act in the history of criminal acts. Literally, James Gunn was an unapologetic shitbird -- literally. He kept being horrible after a forced apology he didn't volunteer for completely unrelated stuff and then didn't apologize at all for the stuff people are accusing him of, which he did while being handed a check for millions of dollars.

Boo hoo.

"I'm so sick of this shit. I feel like I'm living in the Twilight Zone. James Gunn is NOT a victim of Nazis or Alt Right Trolls. He actually made those Tweets. He was in his 40s when he made them. He is friends with Huston Huddleston, an admitted PEDOPHILE. He works in an industry that is notorious for protecting abusers/predators.

And please don't tell me ""Well he used to be a really edgy filmmaker and all his earlier movies were like that"" I don't care. That doesn't make any of this right.

"Hey, I'm the guy who asked the question about the boycott in Lindsay's video. The point behind the boycott is to show Disney and other companies that they can't fire people based on the campaigns of Cybernazis. We know the boycott won't bring back James Gunn, but it will keep stuff like this from happening in the future. The Cybernazi's are not going to stop trying to get people fired for stupid shit, you said they're probably going to go after Kathleen Kennedy next, and, they are not going to stop after her. If Guardians 3 flops, it will tell, in a very strong voice, to Disney and all other studios ""If you fire your creators base on the campaigns of these cybernazis, your movies will fail.""  

While raising a lot of anger about this online is somewhat helpful, all the social media outrage won't matter if the movie still makes money. Look at all the critically panned movies that still make hundreds of millions. Ensuring a product fails is the only way to have companies reconsider the decisions that lead to that product. Raising a lot of social media outrage can help make the movie bomb, the boycott is just a way of crystallizing that into a way to hurt Disney, showing them and the rest of the film companies that they can not cave into cybernazis.

"Hey Bob, let me preface this by saying I've enjoyed your movie reviews for years now. On the whole I find them honest, insightful and entertaining. You clearly know your stuff when it comes to cinema. When it comes to this video, I think using the Masters of the Universe comparison was a pretty clever idea, and funny the first few times you made the comparison. However, painting Jordan Peterson with the same brush as the likes of Alex Jones (and his ""Male enhancement"" bullshit) is, I think, more than a little reductive. I've heard Peterson say several things that do not line up with my own perspective (like his pro death penalty stance), and he definitely loses me the moment he starts droning on and on about religion. But on the whole, Peterson doesn't strike me as an extremist like Alex Jones and other crackpots like him. It is easy to take potshots at some of the most popular people on youtube, but we see some traditional news outlets do the same to the likes of Philip DeFranco and the like. If you plan on turning this into a series, I wish you all the luck in the world with it. But personally? I suspect this kind of skit will grow stale sooner rather than later.

Expose all their plans to censor free speech and take our guns they forgot to implement while Obama had the chance. Tell us more inventive ways to improve our lives, like a clean room is better than a dirty room. Brilliant! Believing a dirty room was superior to a clean one was my problem all along, now I see the light because Dr. Jordanssen has shown the way. Being a poor worker bee sure is less soul-crushing now knowing that I'm a real Alpha above all those beta sheep. 

I've already ordered all his books. Who knew manhood was so affordable and only required hating and looking down on everyone until they fulfill my new standards for them and virtue signal that they're anti-PC and not some cuck or feminazi.

"The soundtrack to this movie is awful. I know the MCU gets slack for a majority of bland and uninspired scores (with notable examples as well as exceptions, don't get me wrong), but Ultron takes the absolute cake. Not only are there no repeated leitmotif/themes woven into the tracks aside from some criminally diluted and fleeting chords from Silvestri's Avengers' theme; not only are there no new major themes that serve as the musical 'backbone' of the narrative (by that I mean a theme that can be easily identified as, ""oh yeah, that's the Age of Ultron theme"", and no I don't mean the end-credits piece - if that was the theme that carried the movie, it would have appeared in more than one scene); not only are there no exceptional moments where the screenplay/action allow for the music to entirely carry a scene/montage forward without any other sound effects, thereby essentially butchering any thematic storytelling that can be executed via sound cues. Not only all that, but the power of the orchestration and the sound mixing are just dire. Remember Wanda's moment where she and Quiksilver turn against Ultron on the train? That's a big dramatic moment and a huge character arc turning point, but the music at the moment is abominably anti-climatic, drowned under the loudened sound design, and just makes the moment come off like another action beat without any significance. Remember the undeniably awesome group-circle-fighting tracking shot in the final battle? It's the sequel's one-upping of the 'I'm always angry' team shot from the first film - you know, the one where the Avenger's theme blasted away at full power and gave us such an iconic cinematic moment? Remember the music from the shot in Ultron? Far too quiet in the sound mixing, very little iconography/memorability to the composition, and the orchestration feels thin and weightless.

"I agree with some of it. But with some other parts i think you are trying really hard to act like how you think conservative cis gendered white males think because you think it might be funny but at the same time a sly knife in their gut attempting to shove their own perceived bullshit in to their faces and force them to account for it. Problem is: its a straw man, and it is cringe enducingly obvious to anyone who knows how to think logically.

<edited to add a minor rebuttal>
Regarding your observation of the new she-rah art-style:
1. The character is now in her early nearly prepubescent tweens. Therefore her body would not have developed to look like a woman. As with all prepubescent children; 9 times out of 10; unless they have long or short hair or are wearing girly or boyish clothes it is nearly impossible to tell a male child bodyframe from a female child bodyframe unless they are either nude or wearing something skin tight thus revealing the obvious glaring evidence that they have either one or the other set of genitalia. Thats just basic medical anatomy and physiology knowledge.

2. I can understand and agree with points made on both sides of the fence for why it is a good or bad thing. However i like to stay stalwartly in the middle perched like some jackassbatman on the fence itself throwing rebuttals and talking points in both directions. Therefore: one one hand i think the art department or the studio or some executive director/producer should have said “hey, heres an idea: why dont we just “shazam” her character when she turns into she-rah? She could wear stuff that covers her vulnerable bits and have leg / arm armor that magic or something so it doesnt have to be skimpy but the viewer can obviously tell that she is an adult woman, and she can also be never in any state of undress whule in she-rah mode so that people dont get all angry about sexualization, but we could give her wider hipps and an obvious bust without making her an h cup porno supermodel. And as the character ages and grows up she can look totally different from she-rah, eye color, hair color, a tan maybe, voice change perhaps? Because then we wouldnt be showing a child being willingly or unwillingly put into a life threatening situation where they could be maimed or killed. Y’know: show the kids that dangerous life threatening stuff should be handled by adults not children who could die before their life has a chance to really start. Thus we could avoid “superman syndrome” (kids jumping off of roofs with bedsheets for capes), and as an added bonus: whatever dammage she-rah takes in battle ie; burns cuts broken bones lost limbs etc. would not be transferred to her human avatar: the princess. (Transforming back heals everything but its gonna take some time for she-rah to regenerate before she can transform again, it could make the kid super sleepy and or hungry so that she has to eat and rest to recharge she-rah before she goes back into a different battle.

3. I get the argument against sexualizing children. Nothing pisses me off more than some assjack who either knowingly or unknowingly does this without self cheking to make sure they aren’t doing it. So i get the costume and character design direction: dont sexualise a little kid, but instead try to show a strong female character who can be not just a nurturing and intelligent positive female lead character but also a strong amazionianlike warrior. Show little girls they can do and be whatever they out their minds to.
4. The fans of the old show are not arguing against the new show saying that she is not sexy enough. They are saying that she does not present a positive female ideal for little girls to look up to.
Moreover the old show was not about male power fantasies. It was about giving little boys at the time (i was born in 81) a male character form to aspire to be, exercise, eat right, be fair and un biased with people and situations, dont start the fight with the bully but also dont back down from the bully. These same messages were at the core of the original she-rah also; when was she ever overtly sexualised? She was a barbarian amazon warrior princess character. She was never in any sexual siuations and nobody ever said anything about her armor or her body. She was just simply herself and thats how she looked plain and simple.",0,2,2018-08-09T18:27:07.000Z,uroborous01,UCKEhxM7iXDEBp-NFGSp5Qdg,ApyNrbisJ_c,True,UgwHvzbpXKPQLlRTSc94AaABAg

Ps.

He was never a scientist and B. He had a successful career as a kids TV show host and is seeking to revive it by backing left wing ideas regardless of facts which contradict the original show. Do I think Jordan Peterson is a intellectual messiah no he says some pretty stupid stuff, but taking the piss out of him hasn't worked for leftist elites and in fact emboldened Peterson's fans just look at the booing dyson received for calling Peterson "" a mean white man"" so word of advice if he's your ideology's opponent then respect him as your ideological opponent",0,0,2018-08-09T15:41:04.000Z,flare 156,UC7krxwfA05lDQQzxTFktLsA,ApyNrbisJ_c,True,Ugz8bwb4PE4YtMGrqWF4AaABAg

"I don’t really understand your resentment of this “verbose older stranger on YouTube.” I like both of you for the same reason: you offer an interesting look at the tissue connecting our stories to our world.  While I agree that relational, supportive mentoring of our youth is a better way forward than these YouTube sages, I think you are way more concerned with the message that might be heard and unfair to the message being sent. You only see him as an alt-right figure because your ideology is too damn far to the left. 

It does appear to me that there is some kind of reckoning on the horizon about masculinity. It is dangerous, almost by definition. The position in our society from intellectuals comfortable enough to have a say so is “NO SHARP OBJECTS” because people could get hurt. And your assumption at the end is telling of what you assume masculinity is for: to bend others to your will and have them serve you. That is nowhere close to his message. The message is to take responsibility for yourself so you can then be more useful others. Why have problem that. Why should that provoke satire? Perhaps we have all been so burned by masculinity gone awry that we can’t even imagine it should be nurtured and directed. But even this isn’t really his “message”.  He’s basically an individualist preoccupied with what went down in 20th century Germany and Russia. Different ideology, same shit show.

Perhaps I'm just too much of an academic (not a brag.

The character and what he chooses for these readings to ""mean"" are all self serving and aggressively confrontational of other attitudes, as is the joke. But at the same time the readings aren't _wrong_ . Adam and his cat are indeed transformed into masculine ideals etc. etc. I don't think that's incorrect or wrong. At least not as a reading. It's then just opinion. And that's what makes me uncomfortable. I really liked this video. It's excellent and well executed.

"As a long-time fan of your work, Bob, I have to say that satire has never been your strongest suit. This is basically a more broad alt-right MRA version of the UnderThinker, and I'm sure you remember how it turned out back when you planned a whole series of satirical episodes hosted by that character. This has a lot of the same problems: It's too similar to reality to be laugh-out-loud funny or obvious satire to anyone unfamiliar with what you're satirizing, and it's too long and intentionally cringe-y to be entertaining in its own right. Once you get what it's a parody of (IF you get it's a parody), then you can basically figure out where the rest of it is going, and then it just becomes an endurance trial. It's like... you know when you watch an SNL sketch, and it's pretty funny for about 1-2 minutes, but then the laughter passes, you get the joke's formula, and then you hope they just let the sketch end before it starts becoming predictable, but then it goes on for another 5 minutes anyway, and it's just as predictable as you feared? Well, this video goes on for 20 minutes, and the joke doesn't have enough juice to make it through half of that. You either have to keep escalating the bat-shit craziness of it more and more to keep it unpredictable, or you have to hone in on the best parts and trim this down to like 5-7 minutes, tops.

This also might have worked better if you created a fake account for Peter Jordanssen, cut out the obvious tells (like his digressions about his own personal demons that obviously influence his viewpoints) and posted it as genuine just to prove that MRA idiots would fall for it.",0,0,2018-08-09T14:05:10.000Z,Pat Hulse,UCCFISTlIVF3lC3Aga8pgAfQ,ApyNrbisJ_c,True,Ugw-K6-oy0La1LXI6Gl4AaABAg

The buzzing is still unpleasant & won't really work for a whole 20 minute thing though.

Unless you can find the perfect distortion effect, though, I say leave the Pilot as-is since you're going to get a wholly different person for the actual episodes. If *they* need voice distortion though, maybe shop around a bit more? Or just go with the standard deep voice modulator.
In terms of what's being said....maybe a bit too on-the-nose, not enough tongue in the cheek.

Great work, Bob

(But to make this satire more accessible I would recommend cutting it down from 20mins. We only need 5-10 mins to get it, the verbose delivery and ridiculous views... that drawn out as it is right now, people will tune out before the punchline rolls around.

"I'm a fan of Peterson. I don't think he's a god or prophet, though I find that a lot of his fans tilt towards cultism and it's fucking creepy; but I also don't see him fanning those flames or trying to put himself in that position. 

I just don't see misogyny in what he's saying. So many of the critics I like, like you, dislike him and I don't understand why. 

You guys make fun of him for being verbose and conservative, but I've yet to see anyone calmly and intelligently take down his arguments with counters based on evidence. 

Of all people, I'd love to see your stance because you're so good at putting together your arguments and explaining things. I watch a 3 hour interview where Peterson makes points, lays out his arguments, and then backs them up with things he feels are evidence for those arguments. 

Then I watch a video by you, or TJ, or Steve, and it's 20 minutes of mockery based on watching 5-10 minutes of a 3 hour conversation. At least that's what I saw from TJ. That's what it seems to be from you.

I don't get it. I know you're all intelligent. I've heard you guys make arguments. I don't understand why your arguments against Peterson is stuff like this.

"Bob..   I've been a dedicated long time fan since somewhere just before you made The Big Picture.  You have an incredibly analytical mind and a truly unique and powerful way of pontificateing it.  I genuinely can't express how much awe I have for your intellect sometimes.

Unfortunately, and it genuinely pains me to say this..  you're losing me.  I'm trying to hang in there, but, it's just becoming to difficult.  These jabs your taking, while they've always been there, are getting more alienating and divisive.  At least to me.  I understand your political views and your stances.  And I understand the frustration in needing to say something.  But you're starting to overstep.  I'm going to get labeled either way but I promise you I'm not an anti-feminist or redpill zealot.  I'm just a fan who doesn't want to be mocked because I'm a fan of other things.  And I'm *not* talking about Jordan Peterson.  

Bob.. I think you have an issue that you need to come to terms with.  You seem have a genuine issue with masculinity.   I promise you I don't mean your politics.  Keep smashing the patriarchy and championing diversity.  That's not what I'm getting at.

You get..   ..weird..  around perceived male-centric thing.  At first I thought you just didn't like Halo or ""Dad movies"" as you say.  Things like that. But, later I noticed a pattern.  For some reason your exceedingly strong ability to be self-aware, nuanced, and logical becomes tilted when discussing male centric things.  And this pains me because you discuss some really important things.  You bring up amazing points about stuff that matters.  But you're leaving certain things off the table.  And something deep down tells me that you know you do this.

I'm still a fan.  I don't want to stop being one.  I made a separate comment that was poking fun at something you did in this video.  It honestly really bothered me that I did it.

"I am not a fan of this. 

The voice distortion make it hard to even understand you, which might be part of the joke, but I found it really hard to even understand what you were saying and I felt like I was missing jokes, so you should definitely lose that, instead I feel like you could act overly offended by the mere thought someone was trying to change a thing like it hasn't been done well before or that it has to be the exact same as a thing to be popular, maybe even shout as a bit cause its the best thing ever and their ruining it to the point of absurdity. 

Secondly,I feel like your a little too subtle with your parody, I feel like if a person just randomly clicked on your video from some random videos would just see it as legit and wouldn't catch the satire of it.

"Please don't talk about radicalisation and self-hate. That is extremely hypocritical coming from a radical feminist that considers males to be inferior to females, and that men don't have problems. They do. Most of them being of radical feminists like you. I don't know why you think women deserve rights (I agree) but men don't, especially because you are a man, but whatever. You saying Jordan Peterson is radicalising young boys into hate is like the pot calling the kettle black. I don't know why women's issues being addressed is a good thing (it is) but men's issues being addressed is bad (it isn't). I'm an actual egalitarian, and I actually believe in equal rights between men and women. I neither think a woman's place is in the kitchen nor in the office; it's whichever one she chooses. And no, it's not healthy for the child to grow up without one of the parents staying home to look after them. You should either refrain from having children, the mother should stay home and look after the child or children whilst the father goes to work, or the father should stay at home and look after children and the mother should go to work. It is unhealthy for the child if they both go to work because they aren't being looked after, and that leads to delinquency in teenage and young adult years a lot of the time due to emotional detachment. It is objectively true that this is extremely bad for the child's mental health. It is a shame that the economy is so fucked up that, a lot of the time, both parents are forced to work, and the child has a very elevated risk of emotionally stunted growth and delinquency later on in life, but that's the world we live in. If you don't think that both radical feminism AND MRA/Incel hypermasculine bullshit are bad for mental health, you're wrong. It should be up to the child whether they want to be masculine or feminine, regardless of their gender, and neither should be imposed upon them. I would love to see the death of both radical feminism AND MRA/Incel nonsense. Society would be a much better place without these things...

I don't really have any strong feelings about Jordan Peterson because I, personally, don't strive for self-improvement, because I'm more into self-contentment, and I'm fine with the way I am so I don't feel I care to improve upon myself, and therefore Jordan Peterson's advice is irrelevant to me, but saying he is offensive, ignorant, and despicable is not an argument...",2,10,2018-08-09T09:19:38.000Z,James Oldfield,UCT4qFUEFcsoC0zdPsyjoXvg,ApyNrbisJ_c,True,UgxYxwbYLHedOxalXXF4AaABAg

I don't always agree with your view points but I always find them respectable and well thought out. Out of that respect and fandom I would like to say that this video as satire works really well.

As a parody criticing Jorden though it comes off like a Young Turks or Pierce Morgan interpretation of out of context clips of his lectures. Don't get me wrong, there are counterpoints to some of what he says, like his fasination with archetypes and not seeing those ancient myths transposed on modern ones like the MCU, or his stuburness about morality (his in particular) over actionable facts (Sam Harass podcast)

As a parody of channels like Timcast when he gets heated, the growing MGTOW, red pill and incel blogs, and more so general bigots that think the world is conspiring against them...spot on. 10 out of 10

Most of the IDW make good points and like to discuss ideas that should be discussed, wether or not you side with the speaker all of us can gain something from it. I do admit I find Ben putting religion and passion before facts and logic limiting and Dave (while i like him and watch his shows) isn't adding much other than his platform and a sound board for everyone to bounce ideas off of. 

Anyway this is like my 4th comment ever on youtube and you probably won't see it but it's worth a shot. I just think that Jordan is the most misrepresented guy on youtube and watching a full podcast with him like on the Joe Rogan show you can see he's one of the good guys just trying to help.

P.S. I just realized that where anyone falls on what's the responsibility of an individual vs. the group they belong too may shape one's opinion on many of the IDW members. Still just because you disagree with any of them don't strawman them.

"Amazing, everything in this video is absolutely wrong. Seriously, satire isn't you're wheelhouse Bob. In order to satirize something you need to objectively understand it first. Since you don't believe in objectivity... Well that aside you probably could make something great out of something like this. Unfortunately, your own biases keep getting in the way. Though it has been really educational in terms of showing where you go off the rails in terms of understanding things you don't agree with. 

For example, my wife would love to return to the home and raise our kids. It's her greatest aspiration. Sadly, we've not been able to make that happen yet. Which is a source of great sadness for her. Your satire, and indeed most things like it ignore this ever increasing reality.

Also, your strange addition of the sexual harassment undertone was completely off base. The MeToo movement has snagged almost exclusively democratic voters. Hollywood men who have consistently delivered films with less sex, nudity, pandering to the male gaze, etc. In retrospect could it be they did this because they wanted these starlets to themselves like a patriarchal polygamist demanding his harem cover themselves from head to toe as an indicator that he is the owner of their bodies? Short version it's been shown over the past several years that left leaning men in general and self described male feminists in particular are way more prone to acts of sexual harassment and rape than the average Trump voter. Please try squaring that circle before you incorporate into this character further.

"Bob I am pretty sure you are missing the point. You actually managed to dance around it quite artfully in this video. I would love to live in a world where the political outrage mobs have obstructed discourse for years now were gone. But it isn't up to people like me. It's up to people like you. You need to call out people on ""your side"" when they foul up. This means you are going to take some hits and lose some ground. However, if you want that superior future you are always on about that's what must happen. 

It's always easier to label someone as ""not worth listening to"" than it is to listen to them. I want a world where a person's publicly stated jokes/political viewpoints/personal pet peeves didn't matter if they can produce a quality product. Unfortunately, things that shouldn't matter do because of what you and like minded people have done. That's our reality, and it's only going to get better when people like you can face up to what you've done.  

Think of life like a game. There are rules. However, through various means it is possible for players to change the rules in the middle of play. If enough people get together and demand a rule change then the rule changes. You can see this all throughout history. Now the players can be roughly divided into two groups. Activists and lawyers. Activists are always trying to buck the system, change the rules of the game. Some more radical Activists even argue that the game itself should be ended in its entirety. 

Lawyers on the other hand, don't care much for changing the rules. They are more interested in the dynamics between rules, the deeper often untended consequences of rules, and the way the rules affect players.

Lawyers and activists tend not to get along because Activists don't like the lawyers exploiting the rules. Or pointing out how their well meaning changes can have horribly unintended consequences. Lawyers, on the other hand, don't much care for Activists constantly trying to rearrange things, and upsetting the apple cart on a regular basis. What activists hate most of all about Lawyers though, is the Lawyers obsession with enforcing the rules evenly.

You try to avoid this part conversation by citing the recent Rosanne controversy. I don't know if it was on purpose or not, but that really misses the point. There have been numerous cases of an Activist type digging up something from the ancient past, or illegally procuring something embarrassing. A much better comparison to Gunn would be Hulk Hogan. Someone who's reinstatement to the WWE you don't seem to like. Despite Hogan doing quite a bit of penance. The things that dragged him down were illegally obtained, but that didn't matter. The really damaging part of the tape was released during the damages portion of the trail. But that very suspicious timing didn't matter. It was something that had happened ten years before the trial, but that didn't matter. 

I would love to be able to say ""Context is important"", ""It was only a joke"", and ""that was a long time ago."". Sadly, we don't live in that world anymore. That's because you, and people like you; the Activists have made changes to the rules. As it stands ""Context doesn't matter."", ""Being a joke is no defense."", and ""Time does not do anything to dull bad behavior."" are all very important rules right now. Your whole video is just anger the Lawyers caught up and suddenly applied these rules to someone you like. If you want this to change, Bob, you have to be the change. You have to set the rules you thought would only apply to people you didn't like right again. People like me aren't going to go along with it, and we aren't able to change it back as much as we would like to. You're going to have to admit to overzealous mistakes, and set things right.

"For the record, Disney has made it clear that they don't intend to hire back James Gunn despite the best efforts of the cast, relying on their contracts and the short attention spans of the audience to let this all blow over rather then risk being branded in the court of public opinion as, well controversial in a way general audiences might notice beyond the hardcore types on twitter. But on the upside it looks like even with Disney's bullying the cast with threats of litigation if they walk, Gunn's more loyal actors including Batista are willing to walk anyway and eat the lawsuits and hit to the career if Disney throws out Gunn's script for Guardians 3, so if nothing else the next post Disney Gunn film that comes out will likely be a bit of a reunion with at the very least Michael Rooker and Dave Batista sticking with the director as he goes forward.",0,0,2018-08-08T20:12:51.000Z,Duhad,UCZAllWXm6VopnzUZmrHtClQ,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,Ugxr973FYMRbX5yUNh14AaABAg

"Ok, you lose me when you celebrate ""Maleficient"" as a successful movie in terms of telling a story that we already know from a different angle.
I presume that WAS the idea at some point, but if that was also the end-goal, then it absolutly failed!
It starts out as a movie, showing how Maleficent turned vindictive, and if they stuck to that track, and maybe showed that the people who in the end won weren't the ""good guys"" or at least not so binary as we've seen it in the original, then it would have worked.
But that's not what we've gotten.
It's a DIFFERENT STORY. Not the same story from a different angle!
In the original story, Maleficient dies in the end! The king, the prince and the princess survive, and obviously the story the tell would be the one where they are the heros, because you know: History is told from the point of view of the winners. But since in one film Maleficent dies, and in the other one the King dies and Maleficent got redeemed, it CAN'T be the same story. The concept of ""same story, different perspective"" only works if you end up at the same point, but with a better understanding of the motivation of the characters involved. And we don't get that in Maleficent. And that's where the movie failed. And I'm almost certain that it failed, because Disney didn't dare to go so dark, that in the end Maleficent died, but you get an understanding that she could have been a redemable character. That would have been dark, uncomfortable and would even have given the original animated movie a new edge. But that's too controversial, so they went with the happy-ending where the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" are clearly separated, and the ""good guys"" win, while the ""bad guy"" dies.
It's simplistic, it doesn't follow any coherent conceptual idea... in other words, it failed.",0,0,2018-08-08T13:49:06.000Z,Daniel Syders,UCnqWqKp4fnHI__jJPb9wPBA,uuwxDLdXALc,True,Ugz8hzbPW7kP5_3jC1h4AaABAg

"Everybody's mad at Star-Lord because he screwed up the plan?  Ummmm.... ok.  How about Gamorra giving up an infinity stone to save her sociopath sister?  How about Loki giving up an infinity stone to protect Thor?  How about Strange giving up an infinity stone to save Iron Man?  How about everybody in Wakanda agreeing to NOT destroy the infinity stone until the last possible second to protect Vision?

The ridiculous theme to Infinity Wars is the number of times characters are given a choice between saving one person or saving trillions of people, and they choose one.  It's the story of selfishness on literally a UNIVERSAL level.  Thanos is.... arguable... very beatable early in the story until people who hold power literally GIVE it to him in order to save one person's life... and it happens OVER AND OVER AND OVER again.  Fully FOUR of the SIX infinity stones were in their possession or hidden by them at one point or another and they weren't defeated or killed.  They GAVE the stone away.

Yes, Star-Lord messed up the grand plan... but seriously.... throughout the entire movie, so-called ""heroes"" were just lining up to volunteer for the job of being Thanos's bitch.

As well as Emilia Clarke's interesting and complicated character and Woody Harrelson's Han Solo for Han Solo being great turns.

"I just don't buy the idea that the central idea of the film is based on transgender identity. I'll give you Switch, sure, but one supporting character doesn't equate to a central theme. For me, the main theme was simply choice. That's broadened a bit in the sequels to the conflict between destiny and free will or order versus freedom. I mean, they actually give us the Oracle and the Architect, two characters who explicitly represent these concepts. It is they who do the most to shape events, and when all is said and done, the final movie ends with the two of them sitting together discussing the new peace and whether or not it's sustainable. It's an ending that only comes after the hero finds a way to balance the two. Yes, he fulfills his destiny, but he does so in a time and manner of his choosing. In embracing both the greater good and personal freedom, Neo creates a future much better than what he was supposed to create. Just saying.

As for the rest, I actually can't help thinking the idea that the Wachowskis are transgender proves that theory is a bit insulting. People are more than just one thing. That's like saying a gay film maker has to make homosexuality the core of their movies (at least ones that are their own projects rather than simply contract work), or that a Jewish artist's work will always be centered around Judaic traditions. Additionally, I think we need to better distinguish between elements that may have helped inspire and shape an artist, and elements that are the key theme of a particular piece of art. To that end, while I have no problem whatsoever believing that real life experiences shaped the way the subway scene was presented (or that the scene took place in a subway at all), that does not necessarily mean that what led up to that real life experience is the hidden meaning of the scene itself. Finally, there's the very real possibility that the Wachowskis centered their movies around a much broader concept specifically so that others could understand and apply it to whatever personal issues or interests they had. For instance, a focus on choice and free will COULD have great meaning to a transgender individual looking to embrace their own nature, but it could equally apply to any other type of individual looking to understand and embrace their own self-identity or place in the world. Doesn't it actually make more sense for two people who feared being rejected by society for being different to try and send a more inclusive message relevant for all, rather than such a specific message meant for but a small segment of the population to the exclusion of everyone else?",0,0,2018-08-05T13:59:25.000Z,stanklepoot,UCd0SvyMBrLHBoh5PhyMCo4w,LGopT-KNvlM,True,UgzUjvAmQ3aQuLtL01B4AaABAg

The Cap movie was hard thing to make sense but they were smart enough to have the man who directed the Rocketeer and avengers was also inspired by the Dark knights plot.

It looks deep and rewarding while being easy to play in short bursts.  The pixel art looks appealing, and the control scheme looks like it works well on a touch screen.

If you want to compare to a conservative in a similar situation, it's probably more apt to compare Gunn to Hank Williams Jr (writer/singer of ""Are you Ready for Some Football"" theme for Monday Night Football), who made an off-color remark comparing Obama to Hitler several years ago. He was fired by ESPN for the remark, and MNF went ahead for several years without him or the theme song.

"When people talk about ""sequels are so bad"", I don't think they really know that they're trying to say that lots of movies get additional material (sequels) tacked on as an after thought, ruining the feeling that the original story was cohesive and especially had a thematically-relevant end point.

Harry Potter is immune to this criticism because it is one story. I don't even like the series, but even I'll admit that the movies each stand on their own, and they also stand as a whole. I personally don't mind the sprawling expanse of the MCU, because they're built to be episodic. On the other hand, Pirates of the Caribbean was a self-contained, well-made story that didn't need a sequel, but it got a bunch of them anyway that I wish I could forget existed. Plenty of movies fall into the same category as Pirates; even the original Star Wars sequels might be classed there, except that the story in A New Hope's story was bland enough that it could be effectively improved by Empire/Return's. One of my favorite stories, Dune (both the books and the mini-serieses (what a plural...)), shouldn't have gotten sequels. The first Dune, the one called ""Dune"", has a clear, effective story that doesn't need expansion, because its ending was the culmination of its most major theme. When it comes to The Hobbit, I'm willing to buy a lot of the stuff they did differently from LotR, but it was always bad when they tried to tip their hat at LotR; if The Hobbit movie had been its own stand-alone story like the actual Hobbit (which would also require leaving out the extraneous lore-based filler), it wouldn't have got as much crap: there wouldn't have been a Legolas to spur me into bursting out into the Mario theme in the middle of the theater.

"How about a S/asherVerse? One that combines the famous slasher villains that's set in the 1980s.

Phase /:
1) VOORHEES
Jason's origin story that's basically Friday the 13th but with a Pet Cemetary plot, and have Pamela Voorhees (Amy Adams would be perfect) be the main character as she does desperate things to ressurect her son; mostly more of a drama than a straight-up horror flick.
2) GOODNIGHT ELM STREET
Basically a remake of the original, but kids are the victims and 14 year-old Nancy Thompson must use lucid dreaming to fight Freddy Krueger (Zach Ward could make for a great Freddy).
3) VOORHEES PART II
It's a classic slasher type Ft13 film but it introduces Tommy Jarvis and the psycic girl from the seventh original film.
4) ALL HALLOW'S EVE
It's a remake of Halloween but from the view of Dr. Loomis (the doctor who taught Nancy how to lucid dream in GNES) and shows how Michael Myers, who's actually from a lovely, perfect, nuclear family for a change, escapes from the mental asylum (secretly run by the Thorn), which also houses Norman Bates, Hannibal Lector, Candyman, Jigsaw, and Leatherface.
5) TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE
Remake the original, have Mathwew McConaughey play the crazy family leader, set a decade before the other films, but have subtle easter eggs and references to the wider universe.
6) THE FOUR HORSEMEN
The Thorn Cult (Halloween 6) that has been referenced in each film must fulfill an evil prophecy involving the Lost Son (Jason), the Dreamaster (Freddy), the Chosen One (Michael) and, I don't know, the Angry Cook or something (Leatherface) in order to open the gates of Hell (Pinhead cameo).

Phase //: 
7) LEPRECHAUN
Make it a horror comedy set in Ireland about a Leprechaun (Warrick Davis) who uses bad luck as a weapon, kind of like the whole Final Destination rube goldberg traps.
8) A NIGHTMARE AT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
Jason returns from Hell to discover his home and the source of his powers, Camp Crystal Lake, is now a theme park and Freddy is trying to take away his killings (basically a new version of Freddy vs Jason).
9) THE WITCH'S SEASON
Now a reluctant Thorn cult member, Dr. Loomis must take down the evil corporation Silver Shamrock (it's connected to the Leprechaun).
10) BLACK CHRISTMAS
A standalone-ish remake of the original; a killer in a sorority house, but have the killer be inspired by the other slasher villains.
11) SEE/SAW
Jigsaw traps a main character from each Phase 2 movie, including Chucky. (I just really want to see a Chucky vs Billy Doll movie).

Phase ///:
12) AMITYVILLE NIGHTMARE
A family moves into Freddy Krueger's childhood home, which so happens to be the Amityville house.
13) FR13
A better, version of Jason Takes Manhattan, but have Tommy lead a charge against him in a setting similar to Escape From New York.
14) CANDYMAN
A simple remake of the Candyman but it's set in the S/asherVerse.
15) REGAN

16) WOODSTATE PARK
The last film should be an original film, maybe New Nightmare mixed with Cabin in the Woods in terms of style and tone. I just think Woodstate Park sounds like a great name for a slasher flick.

I've been sitting on this idea for over a year now and I believe it has great potential if done right. I know it's impossible because obviously different film studios control the rights but still.

"If Hannah feels like comedy is not theraputic to her, THAT'S FINE. but for other comics, IT IS. I lived through fifteen years of child abuse. I joke about that with my friends all the time. My friend's mom died while I was in Canada visiting him and we were joking about it that same day. Because for some of us, jokes are a form of acclimation therapy. Confronting a small, fictional version of the trauma as practice for facing the breadth of the real one. If that doesn't work for Hannah OKAY. But maybe the problem is not comedy. Maybe, in fact, it's that she was abused by individual men and uses that to justify fearing all men. That shows she has not healed. Maybe she's not comfortable sharing her experiences as jokes because she hasn't allowed herself to heal from them and she's still seeing her attackers in the yes of every man she meets. And no, it's not fucking okay because she's a woman. If her attackers were black and she stood on stage saying 'how can any woman not be afraid in a room full of blacks?' then we would RIGHTFULLY have a problem with that. But when it's 50% of the population instead of 13% (sorry I only know the US percentage) it's not only okay, it's coddled. My abuser was a woman. I worked hard to not let that experience turn me against all women, because I knew that kind of cowardice and bigotry was corrosive and kept your wounds open and festering. Hannah is not brave. She's choosing to stay a victim. You know why I tell jokes about my own suffering? Because it helps the wound scab over into a big thick callus. so it doesn't hurt anymore.

James Gunn was happy to see Roseanne Barr get her successful show stripped away for ONE crass political statement/joke. So I have no sympathy for him here.

What happened to Roseanne Barr was a political firing (she would NEVER have been fired if her racial comments had denigrated someone like Condileeza Rice or Ben Carson).

2) I agree with almost all of what Bob said 
3) I am four square against weaponizing outrage in any form

It’s important to note that while Gunn shouldn’t have been fired, he’s being hoisted on his own petard. 

This whole thing started when film director Mark Duplass tweeted about Ben Shapiro, saying nothing more than that, while he doesn’t agree with his views, Shapiro was a sincere person and a good guy. 

https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-shaming-of-mark-duplass-a8457286.html

Then the left-wing Twitter mob came down on Duplass like a ton of bricks, forcing him to delete his tweet and issue a pathetic Soviet show trial confession. Gunn was part of this Twitter mob, defending Duplass but savaging Shapiro. 

In return, alt-right crazies like Cernovich (whom Shapiro is nothing like) went after Gunn, highlighting tweets that already known about. 

Duplass’s tweet was benign, Gunn’s tweets were years old and he previously apologized for them. Neither should have gotten the response they did. But this is what happens when you weaponize outrage. 

This is why we can’t have nice things.",2,0,2018-07-28T16:40:32.000Z,Joshua Rosenblum,UCRKnOLd54b7RiksLn1foomA,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,UgxMsxTRZdFYNrMkqMZ4AaABAg

Many people hate ep8 and a lot are not white and not male. They hate it. Many myself included see it as a failure and Solo did not make money and was a flop made even worst because someone was a poor producer and did not hammer out details until the film was 90% complete! Episode 8 before that is poorly done trash and I can go over at least 75 failures s there. KK also has issues not linked  to her race, gender or religion - she made a LOT of mistakes that have harmed the brand and left many fans feeling she broke the one rule she said she knew not to break - failing to protect the OT characters from being broken.

As is looks now it's most likely that Disney is just trying to curb bad publicity. 
And while this is NOT an issue of free speech since Gunn is of course entitled to make bad/dark jokes (as I have also done and do) he is however subject to a contract set by his employer. 
Which is the whole thing here.
Disney, while in truth no way being a wholesome company in itself,  tries to portray a wholesome image. And yes Gunn's jokes tarnish their image.
Which sadly gives them the right (as current laws go) to can him.

Should he be rehired? While not being a fan of Guardians 2, unless he is legitimately caught doing something illegal he at least deserves a chance.

"This entire hysterical paranoid Leftist freakout spiel can be refuted with one simple question: ""Would Movie Bob be spending 24 minutes excoriating Disney for firing Gunn if Gunn was wearing a MAGA hat?""

A: Of course not. 

As someone who watched Bob melt into a puddle of suety sadness on Election Night and noted his constant lashing out at Trump and his voters, smearing 63 million people as ""White Nationalist"" racist yokels unworthy of consideration because they're....wait for it....DEPLORABLES, his entire rant is predicated on hatred of Trump, hatred of conservatives, hatred of half the country and thus acts with the typical hypocrisy Leftists use where everyone they like gets a pass and everyone they don't like must be destroyed. 

Gunn cheered the firing of Roseanne, sneering that ABC didn't have to employ people who said such things. So he gets hoisted on his own petard, exposed as the hypocrite he is, but because his politics are ""correct"" and Hollyweird is the home of the #RESISTance, we're supposed to give him a pass, say he's a better person now, blah-blah-woof-woof. 

You know, given the same grace that was shown to Mel Gibson when he got drunk and said something stupid and totally didn't put him in Career Jail for a decade and oh, wait, that didn't happen, he WAS put in Career Jail and is frequently called an anti-Semite by people who want Israel wiped out. 

And Roseanne IS a valid comparison point because she had a loooooong history of offensive tweets before she got her show rebooted, so for Disney-ABC to suddenly whack her for her latest stupid tweet was an oddly late-arriving case of sensitivity that was more due to Bob Iger trying to purge positive images of non-Leftist Americans from his airwaves (having previously cancelled top-rated Last Man Standing) than actual shock, SHOCK, that ""She said WHAT now??!""

Everything from the 19-minute mark on is what REALLY chaps Bob's ass: His unhinged delusion that Trump is LITERALLY HITLER! and there are KKK and neo-Nazi marches sweeping the nation. BZZZZT!!! WRONG ANSWER!!! It's Bob's fellow fascists - you know, REAL fascists, not the mythical ""people doing stuff I don't like so Imma call them fascists"" smears Bob is peddling - in #Completefa wearing black masks and rioting and doing massive property damage in order to intimidate the serfs into submission. Bob is allied with the people doing actual violence. Trump mean tweets like a sad little girl. 

TL;DR: Someone who Bob approves of politically got fired for making a lot of sick ""jokes"" about raping children and because in his fevered imagination Trump is LITERALLY HITLER! and we're about to have the Fourth Reich, none of that matters because LITERALLY HITLER!

"I've always had a problem with individuals being fired for having made just one mistake within an otherwise successful career. It's the sort of perfection-or-failure pressure cooker mentality that drives people to suicide or worse. I also have a problem with people being punished in the here and now for actions taken in the distant past and/or under extraordinary circumstances. This James Gunn ""issue"" is both. 

Bob brings up some backstory I wasn't aware of which makes this action by Disney all the more hypocritical. At the time he wrote those things, edgy, inflammatory humor was his thing, his ""brand"" (before people started referring to public perception as ""branding""). At the time, it BEHOOVED Gunn to remain in the spotlight by giving his take on whatever he was commenting on. It could be seen as promoting his career. Sure Disney's current image is different from James Gunn's a decade ago, but the idea of actively reinforcing that image is the same. to paraphrase Bob, Disney loves to tell stories of redemption, but they can't stand by a director they've ALREADYredeemed?

If Disney were to only ever hire squeaky-clean actors, directors and producers, they wouldn't have anyone on the payroll. For instance, Robert Downey, Jr. would never have been hired if his resume consisted of only the failures in his past. And apparently, getting them when they're young doesn't work out in the long run either. Whether working for so long under the Disney thumb is the catalyst, or it was going to happen anyway, a lot of Disney's child stars go off the deep end when their contracts expire.",0,0,2018-07-27T17:10:24.000Z,Overseer76,UCKitSz9xhmmDISK4TGbIOPg,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,UgwCjzlhEBgiUbfR9c54AaABAg

"Going to be commenting as I go along in the video and pointing out disagreements:

1. The outrage machine was invented by, and has been largely used by leftist leaning individuals. The fact you bring up gamergate and comicgate as points of being ""far-right"" is proof that the outrage machine has been controlled by leftists as far back as four years ago.

2. The actions of a man shooting up a pizza place over an internet conspiracy should have no bearings on the discussion at hand. This is a logical fallacy and a terrible one at that.

3. You reap what you sow. In an age where the biggest ""weapon"" used against a political opponent was a private conversation taken out of context about how powerful men can ""grab women by the pussy"" and continue to utilize that as heavy criticism against a person you do not agree with politically do not expect your political opponents to not use the same tactics when they are proven useful. On another note the hashtag ""metoo"" movement is a movement derived on the idea that evidence does not matter. So why are you defending Gunn in this instance when the left is building movements dedicated to the idea that evidence is a moot point?

4. ""Keep hiring back alleged wife beater Johnny Depp"" < Again a non-point issue and a logical fallacy. Gunn's tweets were malicious in a way that were hard to see as ""comedic"" in whatever sense. Depp's issues stem from his ex-wife alleging that he abused her yet he had all the marks and scars of a person abused physically. Comparing these two is starting to show an intellectual dishonesty, or ignorance.

5. I genuinely feel bad for Bautista. He has not been in Hollywood long enough to understand that this was NOT a far-right tactic. Leftists have been doxxing and harassing people that lean right for years and getting them fired from their jobs for their political views. Just look at what happened at Charlottesville last year. Dozens of people marching with tiki torches were dox'd and harassed and several of them were fired from their jobs all based on their political beliefs. Nothing more. Agree or disagree with their politics but saying it was wrong for Gunn to be fired because of his past behaviors, but defending the lives ruined by leftists doxing is hypocritical at best.

6. Lindsey Ellis is a feminist but will defend a white man for making jokes about child rape while being a firm critic of Disney for creating ""weak female damsels in distress"" characters. Again the tactic the right used was a tactic that the left has been using for years. Look at what happened to Rosanne and the outrage the left spewed due to that tweet. Again you reap what you sow.

7. Lindsey Ellis admits that Gunn will be fine because he has a lot of money and resources. Yet some working man down in Georgia, or in Montana, or even in California states that Hillary Clinton is a bitch and is at risk for losing his entire livelihood due to doxxing from liberals.

8.  ""That third point"" < Who has Cernovich destroyed so far? You state there isn't any evidence to this which you take at face value which I find suspect as this entire video is based on the idea that there is no evidence of Gunn being a pedophile yet joked about it on more than one occasion. I much suspect confirmation bias is at play.

9. Cernovich targeted a white male last December for making a joke about a real life rapist raping his daughter. It takes a very intelligent comedian to walk the line when it comes to jokes about rape and honestly twitter is not a platform for making jokes. Why? Because comedy is typically about tone and it's very hard to get tone across in written word. Oh this also proves point number 8 even more since the only one so far that Cernovich has gone after was a ""white male"".

10. Suddenly the left cares about jobs on the line but did not care at all about when Rosanne was cancelled, ultimately ending a lot of jobs there.

11. Trump having a ""white nationalist"" base is a logical fallacy. That is akin to condemning Obama because the new black panthers, or SPLC, cheered and supported Obama, both of which are considered terrorist organizations.

12. Once more there is little to no evidence that this was a ""right wing political assassination"". If you want to call it that, which you do, you will have to admit that every time the left has used this same tactic to get someone else fired, or removed from a job/career that would be ""left wing political assassination"". Once more you reap what you sow.

13. Caveat II: This goes directly against the metoo movement. For years conservatives have preached the ""innocent until proven guilty"" clause and the idea of that, in itself, goes against everything that movement stands for with the idea that ""every woman must be believed"". You are seeing pushback, and will see more pushback, because leftist ideology is fascist in and of itself and this is just an example of what the left has created.

14. ""Cynical troll army carrying out a disingenuous hit job against his politics"". Evidence? What you just did was state that everyone who had a hand in spreading tweets or denouncing what Gunn said were people that didn't like his movies and his politics. For someone who is now ""pro-evidence"" you should really provide some yourself as I do not think Guardians would have been as profitable as it was if only lefties liked those movies. 

15. Rian Johnson, as of recently, has deleted 1,000's of his tweets. I find that highly suspect. Also the ad-hominem is in poor taste. Again, as you need reminded, this is not a right-wing tactic. The left has been using this for well over the last four, if not six years.

16. Again this goes to show that this was never about right wing tactics. This got drudged up years ago and right-wingers didn't push for his firing then. This is a backlash to what leftists have been doing for years to silence conservative voices not only in Hollywood but in other aspects of the country.

17. Disclaimer: I don't agree with the firing either. It should not have happened. I also do not agree with Rosanne's show getting cancelled, or ANYONE getting canned for what they say on social media or what their political beliefs are but as you stated this is the BIG PICTURE. The leftists started this tactic to silence conservative voices, to bully them into backing down and now the left is in outrage that their tactic was used against them. Simple as that.

18. There have been men the left wing has doxxed and gotten their lives ruined over stupid social media posts that have killed themselves because of it. But, as this video shows, I have a sneaking suspicion that you think that is ""just fine and dandy"".

19. Rosanne got fired because she spoke out about someone in the democratic party for their actions and beliefs. Apparently racism is worse than child rape according to leftists.

20. Yes this is exactly like Rosanne Barr because she was not given a chance to apologize and it isn't as if this wasn't the first time she's spoken out against political agendas.

21. ""Hands of bad people"". You're embarrassing yourself. Mel Gibson is still pretty much blacklisted in Hollywood for comments he made about Jews while he was drunk out of his mind. Hell you cannot even make jokes about Jews or you're labeled forever as an anti-semite. You're excusing Gunn and saying that this is ""in the wrong hands because the people I don't agree with are bad people!"" shows the biases clear as day and your entire argument should be null and void because of it. This is not a nuanced approach. This is political bias at its best. ""Rights for me and not for thee!""

22. ""White Nationalists go after successful white guy to ruin his life"". Something about this doesn't add up.

23. Gonna need some evidence that those behind ""gamergate"" and ""comicsgate"" specifically target women and minorities.

24. ""Right wing fascism"" Again what we saw employed today was a left-wing tactic. Do not blame the right wing for using an effective method THE LEFT developed.

25. Point A: Evidence that the current administration is applying any fascistic tactics. Again Bob you began this video on the grounds this is unfair because there is no evidence Gunn did anything wrong...but only because he is a champion of the left. That's it. No other reason. If Gunn would have voted for Trump this would be a drastically different video I bet.

26. Will you call out every other company that has fired their employees after liberals have gone after them to get them fired for being a ""racist/homophobe/fascist""? If not I find your declaration that Disney should rehire Gunn, or apologize for making a ""wrong decision"" very distasteful.

27. ""Raise skepticism when it concerns the so-called Right Wing"" < And there we have it folks. Always, always believe anyone on the left side of politics because they are honest and never lie but if anyone identifies as Right-wing DO NOT TRUST DO NOT BEFRIEND DO NOT ASSOCIATE WITH. You are doing the exact same thing you're preaching against.

28. Are you really, really calling for the silencing and removal of free speech from those you do not agree with politically? I'm referring to the times between 22:15 and 22:30. 

29. ""No standards of decency themselves"" < Citation please because the poster (me) recently graduated from a top school for mental health counseling and therapy and the school itself was very, VERY liberal.

30. ""Stop letting the bad guys win"" a.k.a ""TO ME THE JEDI ARE EVIL!""

I respect Disney's decision to, at the very least, stay out of the political squabbles going on in our country right now. But, damn it! You've made the case for #RehireGunn in, what I'll say, is your magnum opus. Lord, you hit all the right buttons, but you do that very often. This one, though...wooh. I'm sharing it with some folks on Facebook, it's so good. These same creeps went after Rachel Dolezal (who kind of brought it on herself, honestly) and Trayvon Martin (a kid that was stalked and killed then lied on by state government as it defended his murderer) years ago, and many others. We all need to call their asses out immediately and constantly. Some of us have been keeping tabs on this for years, and some of us have been the victims of the rightwing dogpiles on this very site. I do not know if it is still readable, but on my channel, there used to be a message to one of my stalkers from way back in 2008. This is a creep that used sock accounts to post as a female to a male banker to a fashion model with racist tendencies (all of these socks had the same poor grammar and wring style, though). It wasn't until I found out exactly how the creep was doing it that I fought fire with fire and created my own socks for the purposes of taking him on. He buckled and started claiming I was picking on him for being gay, which got my primary account banned, but left me with a legion of other accounts I'd created. I indulge all of this to tell you that you are quite correct about the motives of these clowns. They are bitter, resentful, and spiteful dorks that equate not seeing a white male hero in a Star Wars movie to America being invaded by the...well, hell, they're embraced the Russians and the North Koreans just to spite us all now, haven't they? Well, you know what I mean. Let's say they equate it to being shot in the gut with an assault rifle. It's harmful to them because they been coached to react that way by their online peers.

"I love this video.  thanks Bob for acknowledging that ppl can be ok with the Gunn firing and ALSO not actually support an alt-right goon.  Ppl felt a way about the Gunn situation and I've seen far more defense of him than ppl who probably need it more.  I also think gunn should be rehired also.

But I have this to say(who knows if you'll see this) but The Rosanne thing doesn't sit right with me.  I think Rosanne SHOULD have lost her show, and I think GUnn should be rehired (different ways of looking at that).  Now my thing is, ppl have used the argument, ""well disney knew about the tweets before he was hired in the first place, so they're just being irrational now.""  But can we not say the same about Rosanne?  We all knew she was kind of crazy, a trump supporter, and supported really misogynistic views BEFORE she regained her show.  They fired her because of the reaction to that single tweet (she's been saying shit for years yet they felt ok hiring her back).  Now you and many Gunn defenders may say a similar thing about Gunn but because of the backlash about his stuff being exposed, he got fired.

I'm not sayin its the same thing, but both ppl had a history of problematic behavior before that was known to the employer, YET they both were fired for the things they'd been known for in the past.  All I'm saying is, its closer than many think.

"Thank you Moviebob. This was a literate, comprehensive and quite fair description of this situation. Although admittedly I am a fan of GotG series generally and James Gunn specifically that is not the true issue. This action which de-evolved Disney to the ironic status of a puppet, is a preliminary symptom of a potentially much more serious illness. Consider James Gunn the canary in the coal mine (google it, this is an apt analogy). Check out the Salem Witch Trials, The Spanish Inquisition, postWW1 Germany with its rampant nationalism along with intolerance for citizens not of 100% Aryan descent and of course The Army--McCarthy Hearings. While it may seem melodramatic to reference those humungous wrong turns into crazy-town, they all started as small movements/issues.

"For the record, Disney buying Marvel was the best possible thing that could have happened to them. It provided them a reliable source of funding from upper management who believed in them, a reliable promoter, distributor and merchandise organiser, someone to intervene at the height of Ike Perlmutter's idiocy (Did you know he was the source of a lot of grief for the earlier Marvel movies and was actually going to fire RDJ for some petty reason? Yeah, I'm not even kidding.)  and fix Marvel Studios' woes by making them a separate company from the rest of Marvel Entertainment still under the Disney umbrella, an extra source of public awareness from the Disneyworld rides and such and most pertinently, a Mickey Mouse Stamp of Approval signifying that any officially released and sanctioned MCU movie is high-quality family entertainment that can be shown to your kids just as readily as Pixar movies, Disney's classic animated movies and all the stuff involving Disney Princesses and suchlike. Near as I can tell, the biggest ask they've made of Marvel is that the actors and actresses who work for them be heroes to people in real-life as well as on the big screen, per ScreenRant. Even Ryan Reynolds and his gang would benefit from Disney ownership now that they've proven there's a market for R-Rated superhero faire, assuming the Disney-Fox deal goes through. 

I say all this because I want people to remember that Disney have been generally pretty good for Marvel, and it's important not to let that get swept under the narrative rug by the fact they fired this one director. And while they made a mistake to fire Gunn the way they did if there isn't a broader plan in motion down in the Magic Kingdom that we don't know about, we also shouldn't downplay the contents of the tweets they fired him over in the first place. He talked about a bunch of really uncomfortable things that no one should ever joke about (or at least not without accepting the inevitable consequences) and there's no way around that. Even if you can forgive him with a snap of your fingers because blah blah this was years ago blah blah he's not that person anymore blah blah blah, downplaying that aspect of the narrative to avoid giving the alt-right the satisfaction is a bad idea. You want to help James Gunn? Give him your support, sign that petition to get him re-hired, run and tell Disney what Cernovich and other Far-Right troll accounts have done in the past and why they shouldn't listen to him, propose ways to make his rehiring a feel-good narrative where the good guys all win, but don't act like jokes about rape and pedophilia are not disgusting and unwarranted no matter what age you are when you make them or how much time passes after you do. For the record, I do think they should #RehireJamesGunn, but victory at the expense of giving up key moral principles is a hollow victory. It's possible to condemn his past action, forgive him for them if you feel he's sincere and push for him to get his job back while also accepting these tasteless jokes as part of his ongoing real-life narrative all at once, at least in my opinion. 

As a closer, I think Disney were caught between a rock and a hard place; maybe this wasn't the best way for things to play out, but not firing him without knowing who these people were and how to combat them could have just harmed them even more than firing him. Remember, folks, the real bad guys are Cernovich and his troll army. If we start drawing knives on the House of Mouse instead of telling them to take their phony not-worth-dirt mud-flinging and shove it where the sun don't shine, that's just another way the bad guys could win.",0,0,2018-07-27T00:36:31.000Z,AngryIrishBenjamin,UCs7e1DiG5JaRUitITVaRIog,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,UgzDWE2HduVBcBkCbAB4AaABAg

"I can safely say I knew there were pro-Trump trolls attacking people who didn't share his views, but didn't know the full extent of their presence or how organised they were. So Bob, I'd say you should get this information about the Far-Right trolls and their conspiracy to Disney, who apparently didn't realise this was a thing and made their decision accordingly. Send a letter, send an email, send a telegram if you have to, but find a way to explain to them everything about this Cernovich tool and his vile cronies so they can see what the right decision is. Get some fellow YouTube personalities to back you up, cite watertight sources to prove it and get voices from fans to make it clear that the people who made that survey aren't the only ones who think that. 

Or that's what I'm saying you should do if you don't think Disney has a method to their madness. You see, I believe...

/Puts on tinfoil hat.

Since it's inconceivable that Disney did not know these tweets existed, they must have suspected that people would come upon them at some point, and for most people Gunn's apology would be enough to abate them. But after the success of the Guardians movies, they realised that in the event some asshole looking to start something came upon his old tweets and dredged them up, they needed to have an answer. So they got Gunn and the major cast of the Guardians movies into a room one day, talked to them about their concerns and over the course of God knows how long they decided on a plan. It went as follows: 

1. Should a jerk like Cernovich bring these tweets to light, Disney would fire Gunn while speechifying about preserving their studio's values and Gunn would be amicable and apologetic in discussing his dismissal. Those who were genuinely offended and not so quick to forgive him would be placated, while the troll/trolls' crosshairs would move away from Gunn because they'd think they'd won. 

2. Disney would bide their time without making further comment for a while - a week at the least, a month or two at the most - while the cast and crew of the movies paid emotional tributes to Gunn emphasising the concept of redemption, as in: ""Yes, he said those things, and they were horrible, but he's not that person anymore, and we're willing to stand by him on this."" There wasn't a script, so each of them was free to improvise their tributes as long as they kept to this theme. Chris Pratt quoting a nice part of the Bible discussing non-judgementalism, Dave Bautista emphasising his better nature, Zoe Saldana talking about the cast and crew being a family... all sowed the seeds of a real-life redemption arc - the same ""Rise, Fall and Rise Again"" narrative that dug Robert Downey, Jr. out of the hole his life was in before he became Iron Man. Also, Michael Rooker specifically calling out Twitter for their role in facilitating this would remind people of how ever fallible Twitter really is. 

3. This is not really another step, but an extension of the above: Disney must have realised fans would hate him being fired. That, however, would play into another part of the narrative: if I had a euro (yeah, I really am Irish, & that's the money we use over here) for every time I've heard someone call the Marvel movies thematically-empty, meaningless jokey-joke popcorn flicks that are only popular because of a broad appeal and an easy charm, I'd be moderately rich. The inevitable fan outcry would show that, actually, the themes touched on in the Guardians movies alone *do* mean a great deal to a lot of those who watch them, and much as some people complain about Marvel's ever-growing presence in movie and Internet culture, they can indeed affect us for the better if we let them. Bob pointed out in his Really That Good for The Avengers that the narrative makes its excuse for an Act Three fireworks display plot work by making you *want* the Avengers to join forces and save the day; if enough people want Gunn back, they'll look that much more like the good guys when they rehire him. Free advertising for the better effects of their franchise too, if they really need it.

4. Once the worst of the fuss is over, Disney brings Gunn back in citing the chance of redemption angle and how the characters in his movies changed with him, apologising for their ""mistake"" and reinforcing that they will not take crap from the people who brought this up in the first place, and everything proceeds as planned on a slightly later schedule and hopefully not too much of a black mark on the MCU's history. 

In doing all of this, they would be able to take an impossible situation, turn it to their advantage and get an outcome nobody except those who are on the Internet only to be jerks could get mad about. 

/Takes tinfoil hat off.

I can't actually prove any of that, but it wouldn't surprise me at all. Regardless, send the information along anyway. On the off-chance their only plan was to fire him if it came to that, they need to know what kind of beasts they fell prey to.",1,0,2018-07-26T23:43:05.000Z,AngryIrishBenjamin,UCs7e1DiG5JaRUitITVaRIog,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,UgzTXNaQr7wO1yKQ_Op4AaABAg
"Gunn's not asking for it so short answer no, he's grown and matured enough to accept the consequences of his own actions. Raising up another outrage movement to counter one you dislike just perpetuates the system, it doesn't automatically occupy a moral high ground. He picked some fights and the other side played dirty, it happens.

He's not blacklisted, they can use his script for Guardians 3 and credit him fine. He just can't be the face of the franchise anymore. Also while I believe he has actually redeemed himself and grown it's not 10 years ago, its 7-9 years old. It occurred over years and not that long before Guardians one. Just a subtle manipulation of the facts I see repeated that bugs me personally.

Is the main lesson that trolling is a powerful weapon being abused or is it that being a troll on the internet has repercussions? Both are true. Standing with Gunn is not about fighting Disney, they have a reasonable position. I'd like to have him back; not as a response to another hastag movement, but because there is actual public redemption and the public fully understanding his journey.",0,0,2018-07-26T23:39:58.000Z,Kaleiohu Lee,UC-iNuvMSmFremZra6pzIGsQ,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,Ugz8YlvbkzclMijce_V4AaABAg

This backlash is good for people of all colours, it will make it harder for companies to do this to anyone, not just white men. People don't usually backlash at things right away. They have to happen multiple times so that people can actually see what's happening and so people can gather nuance and context - which a lot of the time isn't available because the stories aren't big enough.

"Okay, I agree with every point of this right up until the last statement.

Stop letting the bad guys wins.

Not that I believe that we should let the bad guys win. That's not my point. My point is demonizing don't label the other guys as the bad guys. Hear me out.

One one thinks of themselves as the bad guys. Ever. Even Hitler and his entire SS army believed they had God on their side, and that they were in the right. Now, I don't think anyone would defend them now. Heck, the last living heirs of the ""Hitler"" name have vowed to die childless to end the short Austrian with a Charlie Chaplin mustache's bloodline. History has born that out. But calling someone a bad guy, labeling them that, has only 2 possible effects with one outcome. Either they decide to double down on their position to prove to history that they're right, or they decide to take up the mantle of bad guy and double down to prove you right. 

The thesis is this: Calling someone a bad guy causes them to work harder!

Why not, instead of name calling, take the higher ground here. Sympathize. Realize that they feel their position is threatened. See this as a lashing out in any way that they can to get a little power back. Does that in anyway change the conversation? No. What they did was still wrong. They shouldn't have one this one, or any one. Jame Gunn should still be rehired.

Agree on all counts. The criticism about other more needing people not getting the same support... Well it's sad and in need of fixing but you can't just be mad about the nature of fame and get anything out of it. Instead of calling for us to ignore the Gunn incident call on it's response to offer a platform for others who need the attention they're not getting. If they rehire gun a great follow up would be creating a movement for others who have faced the same takedowns.

"Twitter is there for you, any time and any place. In your best moments it's there to offer love and encouragement, feedback and support. But in your worst moments it records your every word, whether 'spoken' in anger, in drunken amusement, in drug-induced stupor, in some attempt to be funny for a crowd and see if you can get some laughs/likes, or anything else. It also doesn't encourage you to leave when you start getting stupid. Worse, the plain and cold text doesn't communicate how and why you made the statements you made. In fact, Twitter ""nicely"" packages your statements in small enough bites that you usually can't get a thought out all at once so it's ripe for 'out of context' abuse.

People used to say awful, regrettable things to a few people in a bar (or one of many different possible places) and even then, they'd have their friends to pull them out and take them home. Today you do the same on Twitter and the engagement only pushes you to keep going, dig deeper, and the world will never forget or even understand your mental state when you said those things. Empathy is no longer part of the process. And society has no answer to this. You used to be punished according to your actions but now your words are published permanently for all to see and your punishment might as well be a death sentence.

This isn't just about Gunn. It's about online mob justice, and whether you agree with Bob's politics or anyone else's, chances are you've been ecstatic to see some people taken down by these same means. You can call ""not the same"" all you want but that's just selfish. That's just short-sighted. Your view of who's a 'bad person' and trying to make sure this incredibly powerful weapon only ends up in the hands of 'good people' can't be trusted. You wouldn't trust me with it, so why would I trust you? The weapon itself needs to go. We can't accept this as a thing people can do. We can't capitulate to little internet mobs who just want to take someone down. Doesn't matter what politics are in play, doesn't matter whether you think the takedown is deserved or not, this cannot be socially acceptable anymore.

And listen to yourself, Bob. Around 20 minutes in you're railing against every non-SJW thing in existence as ""the enemy"" that did all this damage and who are all working together in a concerted takedown of ""the good guys"". Your conclusion says to me you've learned nothing. This is a weapon created to take down ""racists"", ""alt-right"" and ""fascists"", and even now it's being used in the same light. It's a progressive tactic now being abused by the political opposition because they love to rub your faces in the terrible social weapons you built to destroy them with. So maybe it's time to look inward at your own bad apples. Not bad people - just bad ideas. A total lack of empathy unless it's someone you agree with. Maybe it's time for a little understanding or nuance in your view of people who don't explicitly support your political and social ideals? Or you can just keep digging the hole your ""evil bad guys"" will one day bury you in.",0,0,2018-07-26T16:27:17.000Z,Bitcoon,UCR1hAufDL0VlERU6J_wo0oQ,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,UgyAMOZtN7H70icQP-l4AaABAg

I've been watching your videos for about a year now and this was clearly the best! Thank you for taking a stand on this subject.

Strangely enough very conservitive/right winger I’ve talked to about this has been more against Gunn’s removal than almost any liberal I’ve talked to (though many of them are still staunchly against it).

To me, the moral of the story is that Social Media continues to be a major problem and I wish that it could be somehow fade away from our lives, but I highly doubt it.

"To the argument that you can't defend Gunn because he's mainstream when marginalized individuals are left to wither on the vine, I would say ""Rosa Parks"".  Rosa Parks wasn't just some random lady who didn't change seats on a whim, she was a deliberately chosen ""perfect victim"" manufactured for the express purpose of having no problematic mitigating circumstances people could point to in order to distract from the problem of segregationism.  Before Parks, there was a case where a young African-American pregnant teenager refused to give up her seat and was arrested, but the NAACP decided against taking her case because they knew that, lacking a perfect victim, it would be difficult to control the narrative, and they had to pick their battles, instead choosing to deliberately stage a similar event so that they could do so.  

While bitterness may be understandable, if you're going to mount a campaign to fight back against an injustice, you need to start with the easier battles to gain the momentum.  You won't ever get to the point where you can push the enemy back on matters like persecution of transgendered people if you aren't willing to at least push back on the attacks on famous wealthy cisgendered white men.  Claims of hypocrisy cut both ways.

"I agree with your post about James Gunn being scapegoated and being a target for a political agenda. But here's the problem. The same defenses used for Gunn  have been used for others. You know, old controversy dug up with no new evidence, already vetted/investigated/known-already/forgotten and then revived for a new mob of online twitter activists is true for Woody Allen, Roman Polanski and others. Polanski was arrested, confessed to a crime, did time in Chino, was recommended for early release, later paid compensation and has subsequently been judged for time served by the high court of Switzerland and the supreme court of Poland. Yet there are still people calling for his death among twitter activists. Woody Allen was likewise submitted to multiple investigations by several independent groups. 

You mention Johnny Depp who you scapegoat and harass. But again there the LAPD found no evidence whatsoever (https://people.com/crime/amber-heard-abuse-allegations-lapd-found-no-crime/) . I am not equivocating between alt-right gamergaters and those who are on the other side...but you know what happened to James Gunn is the case of the right co-opting the extra-legal tactics of the left, based on the same criteria for evidence...emotional claims/exaggerated accusations with florid purple prose/twitter hashtagism and a complete and blithe dismissal of all legal evidence and procedure.

"Totally agree and am thrilled to seeing this stance taken to the twitter-inspired firings. They've horrified me for years.
But. But.
As horrific as the alt-ring trolling ops, politically motivated half truths and awful harrassment campaigns ala gamergate are. (And they are bad, I despise all of 'em).
The left needs to learn from this, and from the Jessica Price debacle with Arenanet not long ago - on that issue, I saw so, SO many people arguing that her firing was unfair but that getting racists and bigots fired was a ""useful tool"" that was being co-opted against the left.
No. No no no. We all need to stop this. Let the alt-right look shitty by taking away people's livelihoods and reputations (arguably the more important thing in our modern connceted image-obsessed world). Can the left please take this as a lesson to knock it off and stop hounding people from jobs for racists jokes or mild casual prejudice? It doesn't help, it never targets the real monsters and it drives people away from leftist values. It suppresses humour (much of  it very, very bad humour but being unfunny isn't a crime - or else bob would be in hot water for his minute long intro gags!!) Anyway, just need to say this. I get horrified whenever I hear about people losing their jobs to twitter mobs. I'm thrilled to see pushback here, and I admit major bias since I love Gunn's  work on Guardians, but as a general point I'm thrilled. But I know that many of the very right-on people advocating for Gunn's reinstatement have not been opposed to seeing twitter mobs attack ordinary people for stepping out of the politically correct line - opposing bigotry, bad language, bad jokes and casually prejudiced language  is great, certainly, but having seen so many mobs jump straight to ""let's get their job"" rather than live and let live or politely (at first) informing them of their error... It honestly pushes me away from progressive politics as a whole and it's a bad, bad habit of the supposedly well-meaning left.

As they are old, they warranted him being put on a warning that such behaviour was not what Disney expected, and be removed for a while, but not fired. This action was an overreaction.

Hollywood does have a pedophilia problem, and that does need to be recognised, and too many people in Hollywood seem to be okay with pedophilia and working with known pedophiles, how many do all they can to try and get a role in one of Roman Polanski's films? And until recently they didn't think twice about showering him with awards, and he admitted in court to raping a 13 year old girl. And there were other accused directors that actors were more than happy to work with.

So there is a Hollywood double standard and it's easy to think ""why am I not surprised"" whenever the someone in Hollywood is linked to pedophilia. That is what Gunn ran afoul of, because Hollywood for years has refused to clean house and not done anything about its own skeletons  in the closet.

Finally.
Stop linking everything to Star Wars and Kathleen Kennedy, I know you have your own agenda you want to push, but she's the head of Lucasfilm, and like it or not but a lot of fans weren't happy with Last Jedi, fans on their own chose not to show up to see Solo, it didn't need a boycott movement, it had disillusioned fans unhappy with how things are going. You yourself said that DC fans unhappy with Batman vs Superman failed to show up to Justice League, yet you can't see the same thing happening here. And where has Kathleen Kennedy been in all of this? She was happy to bath in the successes of Rogue One and Force Awakens, but since Last Jedi and Solo she's hardly been seen. 

She sat and lied to Lucas's face, she said ""the main thing is to protect these characters, to make sure they continue to live as you created them"" we'll set aside how they split fans on the portrayal of Luke and how even Mark Hamill called him Jake Skywalker, but continue to live on? 2nd film in and two of the main cast are already dead, Fisher died and now there is just Chewie.
If she gets fired it will be because of her own failures, for taking a successful franchise that had a huge fan base and used to have high merchandise sales and steering it into the ground.

Fans on all sides don't like where Kathleen Kennedy is taking Star Wars, I consider myself to be left leaning, and yet I don't like what is happening with Star Wars, the badly written characters, the huge plot holes, the stupid inserted humour that is as bad as anything we got from Jar Jar in the prequels, and all of that is on Kathleen Kennedy, she hires and fires the writers and directors as she sees fit, she approves everything, we've seen her force her vision into the films and step in when she's unhappy with things. So she should take responsibility for the failures.
I've lost faith with the franchise to the point that I don't want to see another Star Wars film. But hey, you can keep on with your narrative that it's only right wing Trumpers that want to get rid of Kathleen Kennedy.",0,0,2018-07-26T11:27:47.000Z,mrfried,UCHacyWx0oqZ90IYFa-26J5g,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,UgzeDhH7qoQ9-yKsKgJ4AaABAg

No. Do not hire him back. 

To every self-appointed free speech absolutist out there I say this : If James Gunn were an office drone haunting a cube farm at the Company Corporation of America© when these tweets surfaced,  the H.R. department would have had his desk emptied by a security guard within minutes. The reason is quite simple : as an employee his actions and words reflect on the company, and if they portray a bad image, the company has every right to end their association with him. I suspect even that part of the reason Disney fired him so fast (instead of trying to make him disappear, 'take a break', quit over 'creative differences',etc.) is because I bet he has language in his contract that specifies automatic termination for bringing bad publicity to the company. Most professionals work for companies with social media policies which make it clear that they will be disciplined if they conduct themselves in a manner contrary to the companies public image and James Gunn has to accept the fact that he shoved his foot in his mouth, even if they were old tweets.

Is it fair? No. Does it suck? Yes. But no one is infringing on Gunn's free speech, in fact, that freedom allowed his tasteless jokes to sit there in the Internet to be found by an outrage mob. And then Disney exercised their freedom of assembly and association to drop the hot potato.

A couple of thoughts . 1) As a Liberal and minority the alt right doesn't scare me it's a bunch of right wing nerds that ironically spend more time spreading there non sense in majority white neighborhoods. 2) Disney is a business first and foremost and the brand comes first and that why Roseanne and James had to go they don't care about themes of Guardian of the Galaxy and it's deeper meaning they care if parents and kids are going to drop 10 50 to go see Starlord dance and fight aliens to 1970s pop. 3) Outside of nerdom nobody finds jokes about child molestation funny or acceptable . 4) If you want to fight facism then get people to vote .run for office . Get more minorities to the polls.

"First- Never heard of Cernovich until, like, literally now. I have to question how this seemingly nobody can be considered such a big deal. But my circle of ""famous"" people I know has grown more limited as I've gotten older and have had less time to follow things I just don't have any interest in. Up until now, this guy basically didn't even exist to me. 
Second - which, to me, makes everything stated in regards to what happened around this Cernovich guy sound just as conspiracy driven as the pizzagate nonsense that was getting brought up. I'm not accusing you or anyone else of being conspiracy nuts and throwing some random ass nobody under the bus. But, from an outsider's perspective who only knows the James Gunn story in this web of twitter toxicity and literally nothing else, you have understand how crazy this whole thing looks. I mean, to believe there's a contingent of faceless people forcing online outrage on issues that have nothing to do with them just to sway young people to vote their way in upcoming elections? It's sounds like a stupid plan that implies young people have no ability to think for themselves and question what's going on around them. Of course, none of the twitter outrage campaigns have really been on ""my side"" but I've also thought twitter outrage is childish and never solves anything. I mean, the Star Wars thing alone that's still going on is the most fucking annoying thing to keep hearing about. #lastjediwasgood. 
Third - I want Games Junn back as much as any fan. Disney knew or should have known his history upon hiring. And I feel firing him for it now is insulting to him and the fans of his work. The tweets were tasteless. But as someone who is 28 years old, I'm sure I've had my share of decade old online posts that I would cringe at now. I was fucking 18 at the time and social media had only really just become a thing in my wheel-house. Of course I can understand James' situation. 
Fourth - The internet needs to learn the difference between online idiocy and genuine online malicious behavior. What James did was idiotic at worst. But, far as we know, he never actually did any pedophiling himself. Never raped anyone as far as we're led to believe. If anything comes out (with evidence) to state otherwise, I'll retract all this. But he never DID anything outside of a few tasteless jokes he regrets. He didn't do or say anything racist in his current career. He didn't hurt or touch anyone without their permission. And he isn't in a position of power with the ability to influence or represent a large portion of the world. This firing was largely unnecessary. 

So, yeah. I'm on board with rehiring James Gunn. The whole Cernovich side plot, no idea what to think of that because I genuinely have no thoughts on who this no-a-person is. But the internet outrage machine needs to be put to a stop. The whole thing is ludicrous and every single campaign to ruin careers, artistic work (games, movies, etc), and just make the internet a more toxic place for no real reason is just demonstrating to people outside of the internet sphere that it is an overly toxic environment. I'm not for internet being monitored by the government or controlled and restricted by the telecomm companies, but I can see someone using this nonsense as a good case for doing just that. #letsstopmakingtheinternetshitty #stopshitternet #hashtagsarekindadumb.",0,0,2018-07-26T11:09:10.000Z,AJ Waseskuk,UCYw4rpmrB3URxU2E1RcgQqg,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,UgxJphotuKQJ4eMDsZt4AaABAg

"The problem is- and I think we can agree that no one is perfect -everyone has said stupid stuff. Some of us are lucky (looking in the mirror) that we didn't grow up with a sociologically reinforced need to have a social media presence, or even social media at all. So random stupid things I may have thought, or jokes I made to friends are relegated to nothing more than long dead sound waves, haunting my high school, as opposed to being immortalized on the internet for (presumably) all eternity, or perhaps more likely the fall of man. Even if everyone agreed that something was hilarious at the time, how funny is it 5 years later, 10 years, 20 years. 

Let's take a look at this another way. The civil rights movement in America gained prominence in the mid 1950's. Let's say you were born in 1937, and twitter exists. You're about to be 18 and suddenly African Americans are marching for their right to drink from the same water fountain as you, and to eat in the same restaurants, and this is unheard of in America at the time, some might say it's sheer insanity. Now what if you were living through that and had access to twitter. Even if you were on the right side of history, and marched along side them, there were many words to describe African Americans, but the aforementioned term was NOT one of them. It wouldn't gain prominence until 1988. 

So you see, even if you supported civil rights in the 1950's, and you ranted on twitter about how important equality was, you would have done it using terms that are (at best) problematic by today's standards.

Now having said that, there's a difference between jokes, (problematic or otherwise) and sincerely stated remarks that belittle a person or persons based on some aspect of their being, i.e. Race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.",0,0,2018-07-26T08:58:31.000Z,***** MacDonald,UC9B0_sd5bbWYuCnsMRDyj4g,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,Ugz81XG7Bj2aRZHneVN4AaABAg

Yes, those jokes were gross and unfunny. Maybe unforgivably so for some. BUT. They were made years ago, I think people should be able to redeem themselves, and Cernovich et al are stains on the fabric of humanity. Still, this is Disney we're talking about. If the subject matter had been almost anything else, Disney might have kept him on.

But imagine a better outcome:

Disney puts Ryan Coogler in charge of the next phase of the MCU. This drives the tiki torch crowd crazy, but that's the first step.

Next, the Mouse gives the next Guardians movie to nonwhite foreigner Taika Waititi.
Or Rebecca Sugar, who's proven she can make a funny, touching, epic spacefaring story while practicing inclusivity and intersectionality (and treating female characters a sight better than those in Gunn's Guardians movies). Oh, yeah, she's bi and nonbinary.
Or Angela Robinson, director of the excellent polyamorous historical drama “Professor Marston and the Wonder Women” - who, herself, happens to be a gay black woman.

"As a person more on the left side of center this whole thing is a long time coming IMPO. Finally the fascist hyper-left is showing its true face. They are nothing more than morons who love to hate on whoever or  whatever is popular to hate on at the time. They see no remorse and no mercy to the people they gleefully attack for whatever they feel goes against their ""worldview"". 
Gunn has, on record, already apologized and taken action to make himself better and even become a political activist, but as soon as some dirty laundry is dredged up from the ages past about one bad thing he did and BOOM! They don't care about the person he is now, only the person he no longer is. 
You see this all the time on both sides of the political discourse, like when Hilary's anti-LGBT stuff from the 90s was pulled out during the election. I may not like Hilary, but I would be the greatest of hypocrites if I didn't believe that people could change and be better. If we can't strive to be better than we were before and even change as time goes on then why try? We should all just commit mass suicide if that's the case.

So yeah. This whole thing is a long time coming and I'll bet my next paycheck when the same thing happens to Patton Oswalt and Sarah Silverman here soon they'll hate them too the same way they did to James Gunn. With reckless abandon and manic glee. It's time those morons got what they deserved, to feel shame for something they helped cause. Hopefully this will make them better people and they won't just jump straight to conclusions next time, but I'm not holding my breath.

I've always tried to hold the stance of ""innocent until proven guilty"" with these claims of rape and harassment because humans are opportunists. It worked to ruin the reputation of one person someone didn't like, maybe it will work for me. It happened with James Franco, has anyone honestly heard about the case against him recently? People got pissed because the lady said he raped her, then her case was thrown out because she admitted that she had consensual sex with him and didn't enjoy it, therefore it's rape.

Michael Jackson won his case. He was proven innocent of his crimes, he was just odd and stunted in his emotional growth, but of course people still called him a pedo (even news casters) until the day he died then all of a sudden everyone (including those same news casters) loved him again and fuck those people.

I used to be a troll. I used to participate in raids (I helped with the Mountain Dew Flavor ""Hitler Did Nothing Wrong"" for instance). I used to do dumb shit like that, when I was younger, dumber, but now I'm older, wiser, and better than I used to be, should I be treated as the same person I was then? No. And neither should you. We're all different people than we used to be, and we should be treated as such.

"It's really telling how the cybernazis try to equate the firing of Roseanne or those related to the MeToo movement to harassment campaigns like those aimed at Sam Seder and James Gunn. In the first group, you have actual abusers (sexual or otherwise), active/ongoing racists, and other people *presently* engaged in reprehensible behavior. In the second group are either completely innocent people (as was Sam Seder) or people that at one point had made jokes in poor taste or had at some point in the past even *been* racist/homophobic/etc., but who had in the intervening years changed their ways and proved through word and deed to be good people in the present.

These cybernazis are so morally bankrupt, or else so committed to their goals of bringing harm to anyone they see as obstacles to their fascist goals, that they cannot see, or simply ignore, the difference between these two groups.

You could see hints of this during the 2016 election as the troll army would frequently trot out Hillary Clinton's association with Robert Byrd, a *former* member of the KKK, whose regret at having been part of such an organization is well-documented (to the point of possibly being the thing for which he best-known). That he had categorically changed his ways was irrelevant to the cybernazis. Of course, given their white nationalist tendencies, such callouts were entirely hypocritical, as well as fallacious, but as noted earlier, most of these people have no morals, only goals, primarily concerning how to hurt anyone they see as an enemy, so that should be no surprise.

"Well said Bob. The pitch perfect subversive humour we enjoy from Gunn developed from somewhere. It is not OK that it started in shock (non)comedy. And, as we all learn from past mistakes, of marginalising the voiceless and laughing away our discomfort about what happens to 'others', maybe we can come up with better ways to have our storytellers and comedians develop their craft without first bashing their heads and ours bloody against the increasingly obvious truth that decency matters. Here we have someone who has a unique perspective on making that trip and he gets pushed out (admittedly not into the cold, mostly just off his current soapbox) because of someone who can't even understand the value of a Gunn. Make JG give TedTalks, teaching this exact lesson to creative students all around the world. Make him pay for it himself. And then welcome him back to do what we love to see him do.

At this point, there are only two things that can feasibly stop the country from imploding on itself. A.) Someone who is almost universally beloved by the people gets elected within roughly the next 3 election periods without backing from either party and somehow removing all of these corrupt dipshits from power, while preaching AND practicing middle-of-the-road, moderate policies centered around compromises that incorporate both Conservative and Liberal viewpoints.

"If people are really serious about this issue, then the only thing which is guaranteed to make Disney change their minds is a comprehensive and prolonged boycott. Disney understands money, that's all. So if you really, really care about the employment status of James Gunn and the future of Guardians of the Galaxy as a franchise under his lead, avoid Disney products until they change this policy. Tweet and let them know. Call and let them know. Write and let them know. Even if it is only socially liberal people who take part in this boycott, it should (if there are as many of that group as is often posited) make enough impact on Disney's bottom line, alongside a continued and vocal #DitchDisney campaign, to make them change course.

My own opinion is...difficult. The tweets were so horrible, and so often repeated the especially revolting theme of sexual violence towards children, that personally I wouldn't have hired Gunn in the first place, and I do support his removal now that all this has become public. On the other hand, the idea of kowtowing to the types of people who are whipping this up as an issue is repellent, and there's no way I want to see them get a 'win' on this. So I don't support his removal from the Disney machine precisely now, but I don't think he should be involved in any projects under the main Disney banner for a while (it's not as if he is going to go hungry while unemployed). One of the most difficult issues is that of the Guardians of the Galaxy name itself; it is so bound up with his name, that if he is replaced by another director that will be all anybody talks about in reference to any GotG3 film. Would the main GotG actors support him with a walkout? Not universally, I'd bet on that much (I'm not going to offer my opinion on who would be the 'scab', but I think there would definitely be at least one).

Ultimately the whole thing is a wretched mess, and my main takeaway from the whole rotten thing is damn Mike Cernovich and his whole hate-filled and hateful coterie.

Now knowing this was a political hit job really pisses me off especially when the group in question has notably supported actual pedophiles and other unsavory figures.

"Stop letting the bad guys win:
Step 1.) USE THE TERM RACIST.
White nationals? Neo-nazi? Alt-right? ... These are RACISTS. The president of the United States of America is a RACIST. His first act was MUSLIM BAN. His platform for election was a WALL to keep the ""rapist"" Mexicans out of the US. His first (and only - thank god) pardon was spent bailing a RACIST sheriff - first warned to cease and desist, then in his refusal to do so - CONVICTED of persecuting American citizens on the basis of LOOKING HISPANIC.

He's a racist. These people are racists. Call a thing by its right (<--pun) name.

2.) DO NOT HOLD THE LINE.
Do not lock arms and shout, ""You shall not pass,"" in the face of these horrors. Lock... and load. Digging your heels in to stop a forward press is already a defeat. Ground is lost in each, ""We stand united,"" cotton candy, carebear-stare response the left comes up with.

YOU HAVE THE MORAL HIGH GROUND. You have the moral outrage. What you lack is the moral STRENGTH and uncommon human decency required to take up arms against your enemies - set aside compassion, ignore their inherent humanity - and meet them on the battle field, prepared to fight fire - not just with fire - with BIGGER, MEANER, HOTTER FIRE.

Not to defend. Not to repel. Not to prevent. TO WIN.
This fight is for the future. The future of everyone. Stop telling me what you won't do, because you're just so decent, moral, and kind.

"James gun had been a vocal anti-Trumper and anti-right wing voice for the last year or so. Alleged conservatives dig up all his gross ass tweets and the left-wing outrage machine ripped Gunn a new one. 

Bob is way off base with his assessment. Gunn's vocal left-wing opinions aren't proof of any virtue on Gunn's part. If Gunn was right-wing and believed in strong borders, traditional family values, and smaller government, am I to assume that the firing would be more justified? Because then he'd be a 'bad guy'? And we should disregard conservatives when they dislike something because they are less trustworthy?  That's bullshit. Being liberal or conservative doesn't make you a good or bad person. 

Maybe the issue is that an outrage machine exist in the first place. As far as I can tell, that is a left wing creation. A machine we all liked when it went after Weinstein and Cosby, but that's more or less gotten a mind of it's own now. Maybe we should all take an active role to keep the outrage machine to an absolute minimum,  but then that means if Gunn or any other Hollywood bigshot were to come out as a conservative, pro-trump, or pro-gun, we'd actually have to let them have their job and opposing views. Views which I would say are nowhere near as inflammable as Gunn's gross ass tweets. You can't just let the people you like get away with crap, you gotta have integrity. 

I honestly didn't think he should have lost his job over his nasty tweets. But it's crazy to hear a man in his 30s defend pedo joke Gunn, who said pedo jokes on a public forum, and then have an in his 30s demonize conservatives for being conservative in the same video.

Yes, we know there's been a hundred sodding controversies over the last couple years, but ""refusing to listen to the alt-right"" is only going to further widen the gulf between us, and ensure that the problems are left to fester for another generation.

"Bob, can you stop sucking off the left for a minute? You are making a valid point but let's not pretend there's just as much fake outrage being played by both sides of the coin just because in this particular instance the right wingers decided to take a tool the left has proven works and turn it on someone else.(The left seems be tearing apart scarlett johansson, and depowered it's own cause.)  There's clowns on all sides of this , and this left is inheritly good and the right is inheritly bad talk is for children and fairy tales. Each player in the game should be weighted as an individual not based on purely on their party lines. I say this as someone who leans to the right, but doesn't consider themselves a Republican. (I voted for Obama the first time. Not the second as I found him to be a mediocre president that people won't say much about due to fear being labeled racist for having an opinion against him.)

    I fully agree with the notion social media shouldn't be deciding the fates of people's jobs. That said I'd recommend anyone famous stay heck off any social media platform as it seems like you'd have more to lose than gain from it. If people abandon these silly platforms they will lose their strength and die out.(I avoid saying anything too political under my real name. I can't be fired from a job for saying nothing. I save my real thoughts for my alias to express.)  While I find what James Gun said to be pretty tasteless,immature, and insensitive; I understand shock value humor was what got him where he was prior to that point. It served him well previously so he let it stand, he'd grown beyond it, but I get how people could not be willing to forgive this. (Having experieced someone trying force themselves on in my youth.) I can seperate a person being insensitive , being a jerk, or straight up whatever -Ist as someone can be one of those things without being all 3. People are so quick to ball everyone into the whatever Ist group because easier to ad homiem people and invalidate them, than having actually listen to them, and invalidate their views thru actual effort and intelligence. This tactic been happening so much (Which you, Bob are guilty of in said video of balling all the right into one lump as there's plenty of reasonable people who just don't agree with you.)

"No. 

Look, I don't like anything about the situation. I don't like that Gunn made those jokes. I don't like that when he got called out on ""sexist and homophobe"" (nothing about paedophilia)  jokes years ago (which, btw, was a Skandal so quiet I didn't even knew about it until now and had to go back to find out what this was actually about), he wasn't smart enough or contrite enough to go back and delete those terrible jokes (and make no mistake here they are terrible). And I don't like that Mike Cernovich won this time around and actually found something he could use as a weapon against an outspoken, left-leaning celebrity. But if there is anyone innocent in the whole situation, it is Disney. 

They were put into an impossible situation: firing James Gunn and facing the fans or keeping in on and having to explain worried parents why exactly are they so comfortable with paedophilia. And if there is one thing Disney can't be connected with, ever, it is that. 

If it has been again about the James Gunn acting sexist and homophobe (I don't care if those were ""jokes"" they were tasteless and he was a grown ass man, not some idiotic teenager when he made those tweets), Disney would have most likely shrugged it off and said ""we always give people a second chance"". 

What Disney should do is talking with James Gunn if he has any preference for a director to finish his project. What Marvel should do is to put Nicole Perlman back on it, because frankly, James Gunn has treated her pretty shitty by claiming GotG as completely his own after she did all the groundwork, picked the project from a pile of Marvel properties, chose the set of characters and drafted the first script. so...yeah, I admit, my pity for James Gunn in this regard is a little bit limited, because karma is a bitch, isn't it? (not that I dislike him, and I certainly love the work he did on GotG Vol 2). But to me the firing has mostly a bad taste because of who Mike Cernovich is and why he did it. If this had happened because and innocent player had stumbled over those tweets, like a worried mother, would we really have the same conversation now?

That nobody is able to forgive you when you've done wrong. That cyberbulling is fine.

Well done Disney you've basically voided all of your movies, all of your brands and I can't wait for you to fire the majority of Hollywood since you now essentially own Hollywood now. Who will even think about directing your movies now?

"I'm a very liberal guy, but this is part of the problem with the whole ""not litigating accusations"" idea that is growing in the left. The prime example of this was Al Franken, who was taken down by fox news (his accuser was a fox news contributor and correspondent). We all saw the picture, it wasn't great, but it was absolutely not terrible, there was no physical contact. Not even kind of comparable to celebraties who are actually sexually assaulting people. These conservatives don't care at all about women's rights, but they know that if they aim an accusation at a liberal they have to step down, or liberal companies need to fire them. Meanwhile trump is accused of sexual assualt and none of them care. Al Franken was a strong anti trump voice and possible a presidential candidate in the future. When conservatives complain about issues against liberals you need to take it with a grain of salt and look at ulterior motives. Like when they said everyone was fat shaming trump, the guy who has said the most disgusting things about women of maybe any politician ever. They want to use our liberalism against us, but if they get accused they won't step down and they'll just call us cucks or snowflakes. This doesn't mean that we should let people get away with terrible things, but if conservatives want to silence strong liberal voices by pretending to be upset about things then we have to take that with a grain of salt",15,10,2018-07-26T06:19:12.000Z,Marty LLewellyn,UCSA4RXaCS0CTsiE2jC811wA,gr7Sbu2Zgk4,True,Ugyr8ufVgoGNawd7Yct4AaABAg

"I appreciate the points made, but I do feel Bob went a bit heavy on the notion that it's only right wing types that do this. Fact is, there are crazy, dishonest people who do this kind of stuff on both sides of the political spectrum and I think this entire video would come across as far more sincere if Bob acknowledged that and stuck to the general point instead of making sure to insert an aggressive generalization of people he disagrees with politically every few sentences. 
As it is I am left more with the message ""Bob hates conservatives GRRRR"" than ""Bob has a genuine and heartfelt insight into a complex situation"". That really takes away from what I think was the intended core of the video. 

There are good people on the left and the right just like there are horrible people on the left and the right. Not every Trump supporter is a monster and not every leftist is a saint. This kind of rhetoric is what got Trump elected and it's also what is tearing our society apart.

I've been following Bob since his Escapist days (and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future) and I have to say, I liked him more back then.

"Rehire Gunn. Because honestly, this makes Disney look weak if they can just easily fold because a bunch of whiny ass conservatives bitched about tweets over 10 years ago as an attempt to get back at liberals for the whole Roseanne thing (which are not the same thing at all) and Disney's attempt to sweep this under the rug backfired. Although I don't think a petition created will do anything unless it gets a million signatures, this level of attention will.

Keep the pressure coming. Disney will fold if the negative press continues to grow. We can't let this happen. This isn't the same thing as Roseanne where she said racist stuff on Twitter while working with black actors on set. That's a conflict of interest and she deserved to get fired for it. It's the same as any job. However with Gunn, while the tweets are offensive and unfunny, they happened over ten years ago, he apologized for it two years after the fact before working for Disney, he changed for the better  and Disney were fully aware of then and still caved years later to save their own skin at the possibility of bad press. Roseanne is still the same crazy, out of touch racist and would've caused even more problems in the future unlike James Gunn who hasn't made an offensive tweet since then after he apologized.

Either way, Disney shot themselves in the foot and unless they correct their mistake, they just trashed one of the most beloved franchise in the MCU.

Trust me, if we dont do something now, this situation will create a bigger issue that we can't come back from. And no one, conservative or liberal, wants that.

"IF Disney were to rehire Gunn, it would be after the 20st Century Fox deal goes through. As I, and I assume others, suspect, it is more than likely that the firing itself was done as either a pre-emptive move to avoid pissing off the ""Murdoch Family Trust"" currently in ownership of Fox or in a move directly requested by the aforementioned Murdochs themselves. If I remember correctly, Disney has a shareholder's meeting scheduled for this week and the Gunn controversy currently being perpetuated by the very right-wing voices Disney has to keep pacified right now, such as Rupert Murdoch, couldn't have come at a worse time.

"In a roundabout way, she reminds me of Richard Pryor.
There is a bit in one of his shows - I believe from 1974 - when he talks about police chokeholds. And while the audience is laughing, he says, ""none of the white people here know what I'm talking about; every ni**a in here knows, though"". That was not supposed to be funny. That was one of the most searing fucking indictments of the enforcement of racial caste in America, said as a throwaway comment AFTER the punch line.
And then, you fast-forward 40-odd years to cops choking a black man to death while he's wheezing ""I can't breathe"", and you can just viscerally feel the rage Pryor must have felt when he said that, or the rage of the African-American community at the fact that 40 years hence, nothing had changed, neither regarding police violence nor white people's perception of it.
What does that have to do with Nanette?
Simple: the problem is that there is a certain point when laughter contributes nothing to catharsis. And indeed, Aristotle said that catharsis was tragedy's job. There comes a point when making people laugh at the injustices that PoC, women, LGBTQ people etc face simply DOESN'T GET THE JOB DONE - but GOD DAMN, did the tragic bit ever deliver.
See, at its core, dramatic theory says that the cleansing of the audience of negative emotions is achieved by instilling feelings of fear and pity and ending on a tragic note, usually with the downfall of the hero. And that's what Pryor did, that's what Gadsby does. 

I cried when she spoke the truth about that bus stop incident. I fucking seethed at a society that treats people like that just because of whom they love. I resolved to do better, because I was made uncomfortable, and I realised that change is never achieved from a position of comfort.

Hats off to Ms Gadsby. I assume, judging by her education, that she is fully aware why Medea just bloody WORKS.

And the most annoying thing is that it would really work if they'd made the suit the iconic red green and yellow colour scheme so it was more recognisable, but no!

"I was in my early 20's when Titanic came out, so thankfully I missed the whole teenage hatred of feminine media phase.  I was also a huge Cameron fan from my teens, and worked at a movie theatre when those ""Collide With Destiny""-style popcorn bags were being given out for a June/July release that never happened.  When the movie finally did come out the following holiday, I saw it with my new step-brother and step-sister.  I found it to be a roller coaster of a movie, with a very slow moving track at first, but giving the riders a full view of the breakneck hills and turns much further down the track.  Once the iceberg hits, the movie becomes an action spectacle that Cameron was known for, barely giving the characters a moment to breathe as they navigate all the obstacles in their way.  Then, like a fireworks show having a grand finale, we see the boat split, which was absolutely mind-blowing on a big screen with theatre sound.  I went back to see the film 6 more times during its theatrical run just to see the technical wizardry on display in the second half with that big screen and sound.",0,0,2018-07-21T11:34:05.000Z,AngelWolfPlays,UCmCLClKKuBPdjf2t4KD1pbw,-I2Dgu7mNto,True,UgwMo9pTyR2PwFr4odp4AaABAg

"That's a long winded way of saying this bitch ain't particular funny to a generally audience, but fascinating to pretancious asshats that think having an arts degrees gives them some elevated view on the world.

Sounds like for the sake of her own sanity she needs to find a new medium and seek some serious psychiatric help.

Oh and Bob since your not a particularly clever or funny person it is understandable that you completely miss the point of comedy and humor. It isn't intended to so much be cathartic for the comedian l, self-deprecation rarely is, it's meant to be cathartic for the audience and only really funny if they can in somewhat relate and and empathetic to the truth behind the joke.

Comedy is also a way to speak truth to power, a manner or which ideas usually taboo for everyday discussion to have their day in the sun, but it's okay because we're all having a laugh which the taboo factor, the shock factor, is part of the humor.

Once things become serious, it's no longer funny. Not that a point isn't being made, or there is no longer artistic value in the act, it just stop being a joke at that point and becomes awkward, even if that's the point.

The whole thing with PC culture killing comedy goes back to the idea that comedy is a way in which society address difficult and taboo subjects people may otherwise feel uncomfortable discussing. Once things become too taboo even for comedy, not only does it further shutdown conversations it leaves comedians with little left other than the most infantile of humor to fall back on.

PC culture is literally dumbing art and society as a whole. People are not getting ""woke,"" they are not becoming enlightened, they are becoming increasingly close-minded and intolerant to any ideas that don't align with their ideology and preconceived notion of how society should be structured.

"I realize this is wicked old and you've probably long stopped reading comments on this video, but I do like this idea and think it could work really well, although there are a few pieces of constructive feedback that I'd like to offer. These are for both videos, not just this one.

- The factoids are a bit distracting. I love the little tidbits of info, but essentially stopping the video to make a point takes you out of the experience. I'd suggest either having them scroll on screen, or use a voice-over for them.
- The commentary styles of the three of you don't match well. You are basically giving facts about the game, your brother is making typical Let's Player-style jokes, while his wife is being ridiculous. I'm not familiar with your brother and his wife's podcast, so I don't know if that's their natural style or if it was just the mood that day, however the conversation just didn't flow properly between you. 
- Speaking of jokes, I'm not a particular fan of how quickly and frequently you guys went to the low-hanging fruit of the vulgar joke or dirty word. Swearing is fine. Penis/Poop jokes are fine. In moderation. But it seemed to be the go-to a few times too many. It gave the video a rather low-brow vibe that contrasted harshly with the intellectual aspects of your other content.
- Maybe try another test-pilot featuring a game everyone is familiar with. Sarah seemed bored at points during this. Or at least have the not-familiar-with-games person not be the woman, because this just looks bad and I can already see the comments about it.
- Can we hear some game audio? Much of the enjoyment in experiencing, or re-experiencing, old games - for me, anyway - was listening to the music. I know there's a chance this will cause copyright issues with certain games, but for the ones free and clear, maybe consider turning the sound up.",0,0,2018-07-20T09:08:21.000Z,zughiaq,UCCjCVfex4fBolPOVg5AOzrQ,B8YtTTC_by4,True,UgyWah82UB8siRpBHIR4AaABAg

"I feel that I have to defend Bill Maher, and I'm not even a big fan of his.  I just dont like the idea that in order to like Gadsby we need to trash Maher.
One of Maher's favorite comedic punching bags is the traditional entitled white male, or as he calls them ""a whiny man baby"".  He talks about how the past have produced men that are entitled, mysoginist, and homophobic.  And these men are now still entitled, but also bitter and angry.  And Maher has nothing but contempt for them.  I have strong suspicion that Bob did not listen to a lot of Maher's work and based his perception on articles critisizing Bill Maher.
I read some of the same articles.  And I noticed that many of them just reek of virulent ageism.  As Maher often said, ageism is the last totally acceptable prejudice in America.  Lots of people seem to think that they need to demean older generations so they could look even more woke and progressive. ""All the older straight males, like Maher, are entitled assholes and are completely worthless. Therefore my generation is the first one who are progressive in any way. Therefore,  I am autamatically better than the anybody who is older just by virtue of being young"".   Maher also points out that the reason you are so progressive today is because previous generation had laid out a lot of groundwork for you.   Respecting those that came before you does not mean you have to autamatically agree with them on everything.  It's just admitting that your generation is not a bunch of wunderkinds who came up with all of your ideas completely on your own.  
He also critisize young people, especially white straight males,  who seem to reshape liberal social movements into competition of who is the most progressive.  And this kind of narrative is narcissistic, masturbatory, and harmful to any social cause. Bacause this kind narrative is no longer about any social justice; instead it's about you inflating your self esteem by presenting yourself as the most progressive white straight male of all time.  
And all of this causes division among progressives and dooms us to failure.  Because while conservatives stick together in their simplistic believes, liberals do nothing but attack each other. And while we are destroying each other for not being woke enough, conservatives won everything. As Maher incites: stop turning against each other, win, then bicker.  But we are going to always loose because we think that in order to support Gadsby we need to destroy Maher.

"I really loved Peter fucking up the plan out of grief. I loved Thanos being more vulnerable to Mantis' de-powering him and *almost* fucking up his own plan because of grief. Because it kept the death of Gamora from being a true ""woman in refrigerator"" moment. If Gamora's death had either not destroyed or even valorized Peter to greatness at the critical moment, I probably would have thrown my drink at the screen and walked out, because that would have been so easy and so ugly and so degrading a purpose for any superhero, especially the MCU's most established and developed female hero of color. The senseless deaths of people who matter DOES make us worse, and irrational, and broken. That's part of the point of the movie. I think if this movie had let anyone have silver-lining ok-feels about what was done to Gamora with the traditional-fakey-convenient justification of ""well, her sacrifice ultimately motivated and empowered the good guys sooooo..."" it would have killed every last bit of good-will the MCU earned when Fury admitted that Coulson's death wasn't a perfect poetic moment ordained by the universe to solidify the Avengers, but was in fact used in a calculated way after the fact by a fallible and desperate man.

I don't hold out big huge wads of hope for this, but in my ideal future, the second movie will hinge on the fact that the soul sacrificed by Thanos was his own, and that it happened when he adopted Gamora and tried to make her love him in spite of his lack of any action or aspect deserving of love. When he (even less symbolically) murdered her so he could consume her soul for his own myopic one-sided ego gratification, it was just a ritualized re-affirmation of the abuse he's been wreaking his whole life. Sure all that abuse was to memorialize the death of his own soul to intellectually sublimated rage over a tragedy he couldn't prevent, yay he's so complicated, but it's still the death of his soul and not some altruistic messianic killing spree. It would be an ok nod to his weird obsession in the comics with achieving love by conquest; and it would help clarify that, no, really, the reason that murdering Gamora ""worked"" was not because Thanos feels or does anything that approximates real love. 

Bonus points if they somehow tangentially bring in the idea that Well, No, Actually Thanos' perception that his approach has actually worked in some places is just another side-delusion of his readily-evident martyr-god complex, much like any other sadistic self-fellating abusive parent or austerity politician. He believes his approach is what makes things better for the same reason he believes that people failing to listen to him was the true cause of his foundational tragedy: because he's too big of an asshole to believe anything else.",0,0,2018-07-19T16:03:25.000Z,dominomasked,UCF10JDQ2xyMajuFQjAHzZ2Q,oLvux3kpu1o,True,UgwQIHxt6foAhfaqDTZ4AaABAg

Having picked a curry house, I entered, took a table and ordered a lamb Tharl. I was really looking forward to my lamb Tharl. You can imagine my surprise when the waiter in the curry house brought me a seafood risotto. ""This is not a curry. I ordered a hot curry"" I obviously commented. The waiter was unimpressed. ""Pfffff. Well it's got rice in it. You need to have your straight White preconceptions of what 'curry' is challenged. If you don't eat up this seafood risotto and call it 'The best curry I have ever eaten,' I will put a sign up in my restaurant and buy column inches in the local newspaper to denounce you as a 'Misogynist troll.' Now Are you going to eat up?""  Dear reader, I ate the risotto.

"Jeez, that stuff about Maher was way off the mark. This is why so many people eat up the intellectual dark web's line that progressives are a cult. Calling Maher ""left-of-center"" is like calling Sean Hannity ""moderate"". 
Maher's show consistently supports left-wing causes, he does significantly more than just ""vote Democrat"" but since he doesn't toe the party line on Islam and political correctness he's now the dad from American History X? I'm fairly certain he's not pissed about the women and the blacks being promoted in his stead, as you bizarrely imply.

And saying standup comedy is a genre defined by straight white men ignores the  colossal contributions of black comedians, who have brought a fairly different style. Although the genre fundamentally suiting straight men better might explain why most female comedians suck.

"Bob, I’m glad you are talking about this great special, but you are projecting way too much on Mahr towards the end.

Mahr addressing extremist who took a intro to sociology class and does understand the nuance and meaning of the words they have turned from academic discussion of societal woes to punching up slurs for just happening to be what society has deemed “normal” and calling everything sexist and racist to the point has no meaning. Mahr, as someone who was in his formative years when protests and civil rights act was signed, understands the idea of fighting for those less fortunate because he has seen it. The only difference is he realizes where these extremists don’t that there is only so much you can change and if you fight every tiny battle you’ll losses the war, see current administration as a result of  a pattern over correction after progressive leadership.

Gabsey is addressing the opposite by saying this is what I go through and by the “normies” getting in a fit over some else’s choice that doesn’t affect their power at all should get a grip just like the social extremists that fight every micro aggression they see or hear.",0,0,2018-07-18T06:15:06.000Z,thelinedrive,UC-EkS8lVFv4j3Rl0p-MqzbQ,fh6AbzboZF0,True,UgwnpAaFrxt18bUOllx4AaABAg

"Anyone who at all takes comedy seriously, as in appreciates the mathematical functions of a joke, the chemical makeup of humour, has to admit that Nanette is a meticulously designed set, a clockwork house of cards, ticking perfectly until the fated moment for it to collapse. Even if not a single joke made you laugh, you must acknowledge it as a structural thing of beauty. This is the kind of set that you could write a thesis on. I kinda want to.

One example - the main ""twist"" or spoiler. It's not funny. It's not remotely funny. It's not even horrified laughter funny because it's not framed in that way. She eases you in just enough that it still manifests as shock, but not bafflement. And yet, it is comedic in structure. The chewy center of the set, the emotional gut punch, follows the exact forms of a joke - specifically, a brick joke.

It's just... Wow. Putting structure in a set is always tricky, because the difficulty increases exponentially as you increase the complexity of the structure.

"Nanette works as a one woman show about her experiences and viewpoint.
It isn't a stand up special, and it's observations on stand up are flawed, stand up was never about humility over humiliation.
Gadsby promises to quit stand up, but she already has. 
This has been apparent in fringe festivals around the world for decades, she's far from the only one doing it, but it's why we're seeing the split.
Some will say it's not funny, but then it's not meant to be.
Although trying to pass it off as great stand up will leave people disappointed.
It's not redefining stand up, its something different. 
A Ted talk with laughs, which is perfectly fine

"Deconstructions can be extremely engaging when they can be told through a visual storytelling medium. The problem with trying a similar thing with stand-up is... well, it just becomes one schmuck lecturing a captive audience about her personal life and views. I guess the question at that point becomes whether she's saying anything new or interesting. Pointing out that comedy has been traditionally dominated by white males is not really new or interesting to the target audience she's trying to reach, and the people outside of the target audience is just going to come away more affirmed in their bigotry about angry lesbians (as a lesbian, it does feel like the opposite of helping). 

Mental illness in comedy? Yeah, everyone knows clowns have been secretly depressed sad-sacks since like the 1800s or before then, it's nothing new or interesting. 

It seems like for all her ""bravery"" and the ""bravery"" of people like her, they seem too cowardly to outwardly say what they mean. It would have been a much more funny and much more interesting show had she gone down the list of comedians and comedic bits she didn't like and directly said why she didn't like them. Tell a Foxworthy joke and then an Iglesias and then a Maher joke and so on, directly plagiarize them to make a point about plagiarism, switch them up to show how they're formulaic, point out how they paper over racism or sexism, MAKE A FUCKING POINT.

"First off, you know those Christians who see an atheist and insist that the atheist is an atheist because they're mad at god, trying to be rebellious, or even a Satan worshiper, or some other stupid bullshit? That's what you're being right now, Bob. You see people who disagree with you and you insist they're misogynist, racist, stuck in the past or literally anything other than a real person who has a point or maybe even a legitimate reason for feeling the way they do. Maybe the homophobe was raped as a child. Maybe the anti-feminist was treated like a lesser being by his mother and her friends. Maybe I (speaking about myself this time) am not a left winger because I've seen what left wing ideology has done to people like you. 

Secondly, minorities, marginalized people, and even the supposedly none marginalized people are all people. People are all flawed. Those flaws can be bigotry. Those flaws can be a lack of conscience. Those flaws can be a lack of comedic talent. If a rapist is Muslim, it doesn't make them not a rapist. If a shitty character is Asian, it doesn't maker them not a shitty character.

"When I was watching Nanette, I could think of no closer comparison than to George Carlin. When she was doing her ""real"" bits, the bits she wanted to do, rather than the grudging-but-building-to-the-central-thesis self-deprecating digressions, they had the same general construction as George's favorite kinds of jokes. Pointing out misconceptions that are not only false, but diametrically so, tearing into hypocrisy, revealing that the true core tenet of a certain way of thinking is in fact reprehensible, those are some of his greatest hits.

And while I'm at it, let's set the record straight about something (mainly because thinking about George Carlin had reminded me of one motherfucker stalking Bob on Twitter lately whose mere existence pisses me off). A lot of people who aren't and weren't ever really into Carlin like to hold him up as some sort of ""anti-PC"" figure because he fought in favor of free speech, but they forget two important things. First, he was never against the idea of being more sensitive to the marginalized. If you look at all of his bits about various ""polite"" euphemisms and terms one might describe as ""PC"", you've got one bit about how naming the indigenous population of this country after their conquerors (""Native American"") is adding insult to injury, and several bits about how euphemistic language for disability and illness, counter to its ostensible goal, ends up squeezing the humanity from the terms, masking the pain of the underlying conditions, making it easier for society to sweep under the rug. His argument was always for greater empathy and allowing the marginalized to define themselves. And as for the kinds of people who tend to invoke his name these days, he'd not only call for them to be beaten bloody, he'd join in.",62,15,2018-07-17T17:41:56.000Z,notreallythere477,UCbvXtbsuzkkAB1mBIS1d2aA,fh6AbzboZF0,True,UgysrT3gOvB47zBcmPl4AaABAg

"Straight white male here, you know what? That wasn't needed, you don't need to know who I am, except you do. Because her entire act was well done to different people for different reasons. For the people that are marginalized, and even to her, her act felt like it was a way to connect. As a straight white male, I loved her act, but do you know why? Because she disected the joke and made that funny. She took the art, performed it, and while performing it, explained it, and meta'd the shit out of it. It was great. Then I got a good kick in the balls for being straight and white, while being reminded that that's just an hour and that she lives it, but that's all in an effort to bring reality to the 2 act comedy structure. And I didn't find that funny, it was just a kick in the balls. But I mean who cares, she was right, the world needs to take a joke, I can laugh at comedy directed at me to build that tension the same that I can laugh at Bill Burr for making a joke about feminists.

I always took comedians as class clowns who practiced enough to go pro. You take to clowning because you're insecure about your position on the group for some reason. Doesn't matter what the reason is. Best outcome is that you explain yourself successfully and, using humor as a lubricant, fit yourself into the group. The downside is that your comedy suffers, and you become an old joke. On the other end, the worst outcome is what happened to Chris Farley, John Belushi, and far too many others.

Seinfeld is out of touch yet complaining about the college circuit being a tough crowd because apparently it's okay now for comedians to blame the crowd for simply not liking your material. Over half of Chappelle's act was an outright rehash of his old material, just updating the specific names he used.

He may have been playing the ""grumpy old man"" schtick when he was younger as you say, but he IS a grumpy old man now.  There's a world of difference there in terms of knowing when to stop on a joke, or which targets are rife for ribbing vs which can be total punching bags.

The narrative that's emerged has been one where people like Bill Maher were once left-wing agitators against the status-quo, but have now become bitter old folks railing against politically correct millennials. The truth is, they always hated political correctness. Look at Maher's material from his 90s shows and you see routines expressing frustration about women's unwillingness to fuck him, about feminists, and the ""language-policing"" by marginalised social groups. 

They grew up expecting a world where sexuality was freer, racism was less openly tolerated, and taxes on the rich were slightly higher – but where straight white guys still more-or-less ruled the roost. What they didn't expect was that women, queer people, nonwhite people, and socialists weren't going to be content with that and wanted actual egalitarianism, not the pretence of it.

no just no.
To put this simply;  I want to see a screen adaptation of a story i've read NOT a version of a story i've read. That story!
 Not some other story. That's how all movies based on books fail. (Imho)
The same concept applies with movies based on superheroes losing their super. Don't just don't. I don't give a flying f*** why or how they've lost their powers, just don't. Super heroes are fun because they're super. I want to see them do their super things, not winge about being normal. Same goes for heroes with cool gadgets or high intelligence.  
Case in point: The Bond movies where Bond didn't use his gadgets bombed at the box office. 
Think about seeing a Sherlock Holmes movie where Sherlock lost his intelligence. Duh. There would be no point. Duh.

"It is gonna be a time traveling story Ant-man is gonna go into a time vortex on purpose, and end up in the future. He'll meet his older daughter, an older Tony Stark, Pepper, and maybe their son. Tony, and Scott travel to different key points in the time line telling different characters in the MCU they can trust about the infinity stones. Those little wrist devices being worn by some of them are used to miniaturize, and cloak infinite stones. It's gonna be a time travel reverse heist Oceans 11 type of movie. It'll be revealed that the stones that Thanos had are now kinda just powerful fakes. The original 6 will end up with the real stones. Loki will be a key player at some point. He'll end up having a conversation with older Stark, and it'll be some where in the timeline during his arrest/capture in the first Avengers movie. He either acquires, and/or makes the fake stones. Or he gets the space stone. I have a feeling the later will be true. More than likely he takes Hawkeye in the present timeline to get the soul stone. Hawkeyes family recently being murdered by a Black Widow imposter will count as the loss required to posses the soul stone. Also fyi: General Ross has made a couple different references like this during the coarse of the mcu. It's not about him being a skrull. He is actually Red Hulk. That might be alluded more to during Ant-mans time jump to the future. Maybe a cameo of Red Hulk, Red and Green She-Hulk, and hopefully maybe M.O.D.O.K. What is gonna kick off the Secret Invasion is the Captain Marvel movie. One of the scenes in that movie will be a skrull impersonating a paper pushing Sheild agent to get intel, and files about other top agents, and other targets. It'll be a throw away scene that nobody will really care about until the after credits scene. Where it'll be that same skrull who was hiding during the battle with Ms.Marvel. Said skrull will be seen walking away flipping through pics, and then morphing into Black Widow. It'll be like that unknown shemp scene at the end of Darkman where he ran out, and put on a Bruce Campbell mask. That scene will tease Secret Invasion, and be a lead in for the Black Widow movie. It's kinda why the Black Widow had blonde hair in Infinity War. I know ScarJo normally has blonde hair, but the Widow character does not. I think that once Hawkeye shows up as Ronin it'll be explained about the imposter, and that the real Widow dyes her hair blonde now to distinguish herself from her imposter. Shit I know that was alot to read. But I've been piecing my theory together for a long time.",0,1,2018-07-15T16:40:52.000Z,Bryon Turner,UC4KI6JHTPyD5R8oWkOM8mMQ,yWqIZ5D6Egs,True,Ugykk314eBBrgivjai94AaABAg

"Predictions for the Avengers original cast and where the end up in the MCU

1) Cap dies in this one.   Seem Chris Evans has wanted out for a while and we have two potential people to take the mantle in the MCU

2) Ironman sticks to the cameo and RDJ does this till he is 90.   Since the majority of being Ironman is showing a CGI suit with voice over it’s not hard on RDJ physically and he seems to love the role.  I bet he shows up in cameos for years to come 

3). Thor becomes the new Odin and collects a cameo check for the next for years until Hemsworth misses swinging the hammer and comes back for another movie. 

4). Hulk gets a chance at another movie with Ruffalo still as Bruce.  Ditto for Black Widow

"As for the title...does anyone have ""Bobstradamus"" on Youtube? Because that really seems like a perfect title to go along with the gimmick.

Barring that, maybe you can get a stronger title using ""divination"" or name including ""prophet"".

"I have a prediction if you would hear me out. No matter how the actual Avengers 4 movie goes, it will end with everyone still dead stay your pitch forks and torches hear me out. If Infinity War was tragedy, than Avengers 4 would be the mourning, they can still do the clip show as Bob has stated and still get one hell of an emotional punch out of not one but two movies, most likely ending with a message about enduring trauma or survivors guilt or accepting the world and its horrors while still trying to make it a better place or all three and then some. I base this idea off of the simple fact that everyone that was lost honestly wasn’t that important, HOLD for like two more seconds please.
 
Yes losing T’challa seems like a bad hit, but it gives room for one of the at least three different black women bad asses to take up the mantel, all three of which have seem to be proven to be much more interesting and popular than T’challa has. Especially since T’challas’ story kind of wrapped up in Black Panther.

Sure the guardians are down to two characters, maybe three but who knows with Thor’s new axe, but there are plenty of other space characters in Marvel that can fill in the rolls, and no matter what James Gunn might say, he doesn’t own the character rights at the end of the day they just might have him work with what they toss at him and say, “You made somewhat little known characters popular before you could do it again!” 

And of course Spider Man, well he never really had much to begin with. As much as I enjoyed Home Coming “, there was nothing in the movie that really set up any kind of continuing story, this isn’t like the case with Jon Snow when no one bought his death because of his own unresolved story. Peter Parker’s story can just end as soon as it began and be easily replaced with Miles Moralis, another good diverse character that has recently proven to be very if not more popular than Peter. 

My point is everyone who died technically can be replaced or succeeded, and what better way to kick off an new version of the MCU than with new characters taking up the mantels or forging their own to at least make sure nothing like Thanos could ever happen again.",1,5,2018-07-15T09:30:34.000Z,samualwatkins,UCKh6p7JJwLcZs1JgVjbp2Og,yWqIZ5D6Egs,True,UgxnxIs1F3ZJyZI9MW54AaABAg

Any conflicts -- and there _will_ be conflicts, even if only at the micro level -- will be magnified recursively because you've created a time loop (as an agent in the past from the future, any changes you attempt to make to the past will affect _you_, which will affect the  nature of the change you can make, which will affect you, etc.).  Because of this self-referential relationship, it may be functionally impossible to change the past.  So I don't think that's going to work.
Which leads me to My Take on The End of _Avengers: Infinity War_ :  Nobody actually died.
Something about the end of that movie bothered me:  Everyone who ""died"" after Thanos snapped his fingers just evaporated.  Anyone who knows anything about the law of mass/energy conservation knows that mass/energy cannot simply be destroyed.  Yet that is what we were shown -- people simply disappeared.  They didn't fall over dead (thereby conserving mass), and they didn't disappear in a blinding flash (their mass being converted to energy).  So some notable fraction of the mass of the Universe just vanished without being replaced with anything.  According to the laws of physics as we understand them today, this is impossible (Infinity Stones be damned).
So therefore, since it's impossible...  It didn't happen.
What I think happened instead is that the Universe was split in two -- one containing half the living beings, and the other containing the other half.  Such an arrangement maintains the mass-energy constant of the Universe, by simply (more or less) equally dividing it between the two sub-Universes.  Oh, and Thanos is the only one who exists in both copies, so that each one sees half the population missing (they just see different halves).
By dividing everything in half, it also reduces the available mass/energy in each sub-Universe, thereby negating Thanos' stated goal of restoring his idea of balance (the population is reduced, but so are the available resources).  The fourth film, therefore, would be the Avengers in each sub-Universe seeking to reunite the two halves, and showing Thanos that he completely whiffed, his theory was utter bullshit, he ended up inflicting a lot of pain and misery for no good purpose, and didn't solve a damned thing.  Such an ending would have the added benefit of not only destroying Thanos as antagonist, it would also destroy Thanos as misunderstood genius.",17,9,2018-07-15T08:50:52.000Z,ewhac,UCh0GdE_8zFwzcxyjNFuKrTQ,yWqIZ5D6Egs,True,Ugz-y50Ak69femYj0_F4AaABAg

"I kinda feel like your trying to expand your programming by splitting up in Bob we trust into several shows except game watch that's a let's play with facts. I'm on board either way you go with it though cause on the one hand I don't think you should split 1 show into 5 on the other I feel like this might be a way to calm the masses if they don't share in a specific love for something.

So in essence people can skip over videos or content they don't like.

Btw I like the name avenger forever premise and though people keep spouting endgame like it's the title cause it was on some promotional bit,   for some contractor. I think avenger infinite could also work as a title. Cause like you said heat death or trump bomb, plus it's based on a comic where thanos wins, but finds it doesn't really bring him any sense of accomplishment or happiness. Imagine if they did that thanos has won, but he regrets the road to get there, But he can't undo it cause the gauntlet was destroyed. Along with the stones, so he uses ant-man to go back in time and reverse everything. Yeah, I know that would be a major change, but think of it this way, thanos basically defeats himself. If he goes back and stops this from happening his current self won't change he will still be a player down the line and the infinity stones would be around too.

"I may seem out of my mind here, BUT, part of me feels as if Part 2's title will simply be ""Avengers: Infinity Gauntlet"". There are two main reasons I give for this:

1 - It's a good way of letting audiences who may have not known at all about the properties that this is connected to the first installment, while at the same time, not doing something as tacky or uncreative as just saying : ""Infinity War Part 2"".

2 - The people at the MCU REALLY know their material. And judging as how they know the comics, it's clear that the events of Infinity War, ironically, are more based on the Thanos Quest storyline where the Mad Titan actually gets all the stones, as opposed to the original Infinity Gauntlet storyline that is set after the Quest series, and begins with him having everything. The only real moment from Infinity Gauntlet in Infinity War was the last three minutes of the movie. Plus, since Part 2 would begin with Thanos having all the stones in the gauntlet, it would make sense why it's called Infinity Gauntlet this time since the object itself is completed and now the main struggle of the film is getting that thing away from Thanos and preventing him from using it anymore.

"Hi Bob, sorry about the following criticism, but I'm going to try to be constructive:

i) I like the idea, although as well-worn as the style is, I don't think you needed to lampshade it quite so heavily.  Also, even though it is a pilot, an actual sample title goes a long way.

ii) You need to cut down on the editing.  I appreciate your regular style utilises quick cuts and a rapid-fire delivery, but so much of comedy relies on the flow of the delivery, or 'timing'.  The essence of a joke is the subversion of expectation, and so you need to allow the audience time to realise that expection before subverting it.  Try to get a few entire takes, and leave in the pauses rather than stitching together the cleanest audio reads.

iii) You're not going to want to hear this, but a lot of comedy is expressed through the eyes.  I'm not sure if there is a medical reson for your sunglasses, whether they are a fashion statement or merely a vanity, but if you have any hopes of this series taking off beyond your core audience, I implore you to remove them if at all possible.

Again, apologies for the above.  As I said earlier, I like the idea, and the jokes themselves are solid, but I feel some work needs to be done on the delivery.  Also, if you stick with the same intro, it needs to be shorter.",10,1,2018-07-13T21:22:58.000Z,controversialverdict,UCo3G1XkADyf28Rm_y9XQR7Q,0-tMK4Gozg0,True,Ugx4Di1OP866YiTEeeZ4AaABAg

CONS 
- Not crazy about the 8-bit intro music. Maybe something a little more newsy-sounding.
- Wardrobe. Love the red Spiderman shirt but I feel like you should wear a tie or something. The whole tattered, hand-me-down suit jacket is a great spoof on how overdressed news anchors are but I feel like you could go even further. Really satirize those bastards.
- Most importantly, this is gold. Don't do too much too quick. Space the videos out and pace yourself. This could be legendary with a little more practice so don't burn out too quick.

"This isn't working for me. Note that I don't have any good ideas to offer, largely because this is a creative endeavor for you and it should be your voice here. I'm a musician, so I understand creative processes and the time and effort it takes to get something ""right"" in your own head, so I hope you'll accept this as an attempt at constructive criticism.

First, news desk comedy works because it's a simple setup-punchline format. Many variations exist -- the current SNL guys sometimes follow up with op-ed standup material, Seth Meyers' Closer Look segments put bite size jokes into a narrative format, and so on -- but all of the jokes are short. ""Critics have complained the new Rambo film is far too violent and has racist overtones. Director and star Sylvester Stallone was asked for a few words in response, but be couldn't think of any."" Short, sweet, in-and-out (setting aside whether you think it's funny). Your style, though, is all about expositional density, and it doesn't quite work in the setup-punchline format. Timing is essential in comedy, so the longer a joke is, the less impactful it will be when the punchline drops. Most jokes (in the world) aren't brilliantly clever, relying on a few simple devices like snarky comments, hokey puns, and so on. If the setup is short, those can be funny; if it's not, go a long way not to laugh. 

Second, it seems like you're trying on a kind-of ""comedy anchor"" character or posture, but I think that's the opposite of your strengths. See, I think you *already* inhabit a ""character"" in your regular reviews and analysis videos. Most of the time MovieBob is there applying deep analysis and thoughtful consideration to movies and games and other pop culture phenomena, and going to great lengths to establish context and point out obscured connections, delivering it all with tempered passions and a clear voice. Then there's Bob, who cuts through all that pretense with a verbal sword made of profanity and forged in the crucible of a Boston accent so thick you can grill it, and uses it to slice through Transformers movies. And instead letting Raw Bob play some more, you're trying on this Chevy Chase thing and it's coming off like dad jokes.",0,0,2018-07-13T20:48:19.000Z,Xyshom Avazax,UCIGPpEW5LHl0hPdgQ80bRnw,0-tMK4Gozg0,True,Ugx5-7Blc4NkVmxXu-54AaABAg

"Jesus tap-dancing Christ every piece of movie news in this made me roll my eyes so hard I gave myself cataracts. Guys, can we stop the whole ""derailing the entertainment industry to pander to nerd subculture for money"" shtick now? Seriously, what has this god-awful period of comic book movies honestly brought us culturally? I can count on one hand the number of films that were actually interesting or actually had something profound to say. 

I've been defending this shit for years so i'm not in the film snob crowd of people who hate superheroes but jerk off over the equally bland, historical-revisionist, Western obsession films had decades back but I think nerds and nerd subculture have done more than enough to prove themselves as nothing more than an unsympathetic group of racist, misogynistic, perpetually immature white dudes harbouring a creepy obsession with sub-par retro teen schlock. 

Before you insecure creeps start yelling at me about how Batman is high art, or that Star Wars changed you as a person (yikes, who knew a second-rate Dune rip-off could have such an effect) let me get it straight that there's nothing wrong with liking media or having a great love and respect for it, and technically all of this stuff, regardless of it's quality counts as art. But when the entire basis of your confidence as a person and sense of identity is built around Action Comics #147whoevencares; and you literally stalk and harass and wish death upon people because they got the colour of Booster Golds belt wrong, you stop being a passionate fan and you start being a seriously childish asshole who needs to accept that not everyone cares about your particular thing.

There's this pathetic desire among nerd guys (and white guys in general) to have them and their ""art"" taken VERY seriously so for the past 15 years we've all had to act like the blatant, self-aggrandising power fantasies of the most coddled demographic on the planet is this super important, deep body of work and TOTALLY NOT CHILDRENS BOOKS SHUT UP because it brings in the box office revenue. 

I could talk for hours about how not-that-important or deep this shit is but i'm so fucking tired of constantly hearing about dumb nerd trivia and mediocre movies that only exist so some fucking neckbeard can sit on his fat ass for two hours and breathe heavily before going home and bitching to the internet about why the mere presence of women and minorities is obviously a conspiracy by ""da jews"" to destroy him and his precious ""culture"" if you can even call it that.

TL:DR: Fuck nerds. Fuck nerd subculture. Fuck all this boring, barely-even-passing as science fiction bullshit. Sorry for the rant Bob, this is a really neat show idea! Someone below in the comments came up with ""NewsBob"" and I think that's perfect, good luck!",0,0,2018-07-13T20:31:28.000Z,Samael Malkira,UCL9TnYqchz2fdQeenXKeKTg,0-tMK4Gozg0,True,UgxJGfVmBIaH0tDPIA14AaABAg

On the whole good but feels like it needs a hook. Most ideas would increase production cost/time like ticker jokes or changing the cut to layout to appear as panelist.

I have a friend who’s always said he doesn’t like Superman, and yet last year when I decided I wanted to watch all of the Superman movies in a row, he wanted to see them with me. I had seen some and he had seen none. Just from watching how Jimmy was portrayed in the Reeves Superman movies gave him enough context that when we got to BvS (the extended edition of course) he was visibly disturbed by the opening scenes.

"So I actually agree with what some others have said that ""Untitled Moviebob News"" or something similarly tongue in cheek is a good title. 

But this needs some work. If you are going to stick with the deadpan delivery then the material has to be inherently ridiculous to create the dissonance of humor. Also you need to slow *waaaaaay* the hell down. Your fast talking delivery works really well in a review medium because it conveys that you have a lot to say and little time to say it. But comedy is about timing more than how much info you can stuff into a segment. The reason why the daily show, colbert report, Last Week Tonight, SNL news, and other works is because they are in on the joke. they are mocking. Trevor Noah has infectious laughter and really loves dissing on things that he sees as stupid or nonsensical. He incorporates his unique experiences growing up in poverty in Africa to lend credibility to why he finds things comically bizarre. 

If oyu really want to do this I would just full stop rip off the correspondents system from the daily show. Get a couple of geeky youtubers together an have them do short segments on specific topics, lending their unique sense of humor to the topic. 

The biggest flaw I see though is that I'm just not sure movie/video game news is funny enough to warrant a comedy news show dedicated to it. Not unless you have really strong and easily exaggerated opinions about a large portion of it. 

My point is delivering in the same tone you review and do focus pieces in didn't really work for me here.

"ok so comments
1) i really like the overall concept. getting entertainment/nerd news from someone who has actual opinions about things and isn't trying to be as ""balanced"" as possible is refreshing - echo chamber comments be damned, i'm ok with it here. 
2) the ""news reader"" voice is kind of grating. i know how you talk, and i like your style when you are speaking form the heart... especially as someone from Massachusetts who likes those hints of a boston accent. personally i'd rather just hearing about entertainment news from you with the same pictures and all that... but maybe at least tone down the ""news anchor"" part of it. it really doesn't suit you, and seems forced. 
3) as said somewhere else here, keeping the title ""untitled MovieBob News Project"" is kind of funny, but not very marketable or indicative of what you're trying to do.

"The reason why comics fans are moaning about Wilson writing Wonder Woman is that her ""style"" of Social Political stories have not been at all popular and haven't made any money for Marvel Comics.
The ""activist writers"" have tanked Marvel Comics to a point where Disney is thinking of stepping in to try and save the comics side of the company, by layoffs of the writers and staff that are caused the mess in the first place, as is is going bankrupt due to plummeting sales. 
At this point Marvel Studios are keeping the comics division afloat.
This is due to the fact that Social Justice and Feminist Comics are not popular with comics fans as they are frankly boring as hell.
DC has so far mostly stayed out of all of that ""culture"" by not adding social politics into most of their titles, where they have only lost around 9% of their business since the late 90's where Marvel has lost almost 50% of theirs in the same time period.
As a fanboy I can admit that we can get very irate with anyone ""messing"" with our beloved franchises and some of us have gone too far expressing this outrage, with some rather awful actions.
The actions of the people responsible to our outrage also does not help when they actively attack people for not liking their work for legitimate reasons (eg. Ghostbusters 2016 and the recent Star Wars movies)

"Bob, i like you. I like watching you. And this could be a thing but you're going to have to do a few things. 
1) Either get contact lenses, use a black background with white text to read your promps, or just wing it and edit the bad takes, but the sunglasses have got to go.
2) Cleaner editing. cut out the dead space reactions that'd probably really add to the effect if we could see your face, but as it is... they don't. 
3) cyclical writing. If you're gonna use cartmen for a reaction, have him be at least three reactions throughout the video. Make your criticism feel like criticism and not just ""here's my hot take reaction"". Especially when you're criticizing the reactions of others. 
4) Include the context for jokes you're making. The bit about five nights reaction videos would've been funny if in your description you'd included attention to how much reaction videos greatly outweighed the playing of the game. I had to pause the video to explain this joke to my son, who didn't get it. Meanwhile the joker throwing away money gag worked solidly because the story up to that point had been about the joker. It was bringing the early references back... and was good.

"I like the idea but since I guess the idea here if for constructive criticism and feedback I would suggest less parody and maybe tone down the sarcasm just a tad. 

I'd like a news show like this from you because I consider you an educated source who can criticise things he likes and give credit to thing he doesn't. The dry criticism of audience and businesses is good but it would be better i it were a reaction to the news and not the punchline. I think if you tone down the comedy of the news telling and make it less parody you could actually have an informative show here that is worth more than just the jokes. I'm not saying get rid of the jokes but not every story needs to end in a punchline. Telling us about the joker films didn't require a joke beyond just quick jab at how convoluted that sounds and the ""somebody stop me"" clip could easily have added enough joke on it's own. I guess what I'm saying is lean into the journalism more than the comedy.

"The usual wit is present. However I'm not that bothered by what's coming up because if it's too early for trailers, let alone reviews, it seems too early to judge. So without the sort of extended insight on show in the reviews, IBWT, and the like, the show rings a bit hollow. 

If this became a weekly thing I'd probably still watch it, but I don't feel it's Bob's best.

I can't help but wonder if it's a way of seeing what upcoming productions the audience really wants to know more about, by scanning through the comments or perhaps using some search tool to see what topics come up most in them.

While getting to know the audience seems laudable, it seems to me that Bob will write and speak best about whatever most interests Bob.

"As much as I do see where you're coming from, Bob, the fact that *so many* people did not see it in the way you did means that there is something wrong with the presentation. 
And I also don't really see your argument for Rey not being a Mary Sue holding up. Yes, the metanarrative might be trying to say that, but her actual functioning within the story text doesn't. She still doesn't appear to grow, doesn't appear to make mistakes, and that makes her feel stagnant. Her seeming to be 'good enough' to do all the things with the force she's been doing, and fight the people she's been put up against, without that growth does make her feel overpowered, without that development. 
I know you didn't cover this aspect in this video, but I also felt incredibly insulted by the portrayal of their female characters. 
The degree to which it felt like the world, story, or other character's logic had to be warped in order for many of them to get their big moments was really disappointing for someone who was excited by the prospect of more female representation in Star Wars (especially and specifically the Asian female representation, unfortunately). 
This isn't coming from some Star Wars superfan, who's angry about the canon or whatever, either. 
I was raised and grew up around people who adore it, but I've never really given a shit about the series as a whole to any meaningful degree. I probably wasn't going to see this movie if my dad and brother hadn't wanted to make it a family outing to go see it, and I'm also wasn't really planning to see the next movie after this, whether TLJ turned out great or not.

"For me, this movie had flaws, a ridiculous amount, but I can forgive that because I completely understood what the movie was trying to do, and it's good qualities outweigh the nitpicks I had with it completely. 

Luke Skywalker? Perfect. I'm sorry, but if he was what everyone thought he was going to be, it would have been boring as hell. I wouldn't have remotely any interest in that case if it wasn't for the fact he was Luke Skywalker. I liked the fact he was jaded, and he wasn't by any means ever a perfect or logical character. Stop pretending that he was, he was emotional as hell, that's what made him interesting. 

The whole Casino arc was a bit iffy, and was just poorly executed in some places, but at the very least on a thematic level it made sense to be in there. It's just one of those weird side quests the Star Wars franchise feels they need to do for some reason, and if it does have potential, it's often poorly executed. 

The humor was atrocious at times, hilarious at other times. They need to find that balance, and over saturation of it isn't helping their case at all.

The Leia thing? I'm honestly surprised everyone is so worked up about this. The force has always been deus ex machina, I just figured it was a new thing it could do. They literally come up with new ways the force is used every movie, calm down, it's not that serious. 

The Kylo Ren and Rey thing was the whole damn movie. It was great, executed well. My only complaint is that slow paced battle sequenced that would have been awesome with more intense choreography. And the whole Rey's parents thing? I honestly didn't give a shit, that's not why I went into this movie. It's clear this is a story focused on the rebellion, and the questioning of legacy. So that fit in perfectly, and I'm impressed they went that route. 

You should honestly be relieved Snoke didn't get such a big piece. I would have lost patience with this series if he was another Emperor Palpatine. I'm not sitting through the same damn plot points, that's this series's  problem lately. 

Overall, it's a different Star Wars movie attempting to shift the story into an unpredictable and fresh direction, which I appreciate, but those high on nostalgia are treating as devil speech. Just know if those people keep reacting so poorly to these movies like they are (you can dislike this movie, but harassment is a completely different matter) then you're going to kill the franchise.

"My biggest issue with star wars is the sjw bull crap. To me The sjw group is made up of a bunch of illogical, hypocritical and unreasonable babies. If I was not with my wife and her patents when seeing it I would have walked out in the first 5mins. I'm referring to the scene of a woman helping to pilot the empire's ship. I was like ""oh great! The EVIL empire is so diverse and progressive!"" and i could tell where the movie was going from that point. Even if they made the greatest star wars story ever told I would acknowledge that fact, but I would still want nothing to do the series as long as they keep trying to shove their sjw agenda down my throat. I am not saying that everyone needs to come on my side, this is just how I feel personally. If you liked the movie fine, just don't try to tell me it was good. They took something that I really liked and enjoyed and turned it into a political platform for one of the dumbest non-issues they could think of. I'm out for good till that goes away, but that's just me. 

Now on to the story itself. If you want to change star wars, fine, but at least write a story that makes sense. Flying through space hoping they run out of fuel when that shouldn't matter due to being in space ect. I could go on. That's what happens when you are too focused on your agenda, you tend to care more about that than making a good movie. 

The writers and directors themselves bother me as well. Trying to say that it didn't do well because of white males and then making up other excuses is not the way to go. Insulting and criticizing your fan base as a whole instead of actually listening has turned me off even further to the franchise, which proves even more that they are just a bunch of unreasonable sjw fools.",0,0,2018-07-04T14:11:28.000Z,Chris andrews,UCEq2FoOSQabmU8iKmtoobsQ,qf_rqde7B0A,True,Ugy-KSaomhpUHKEtw-t4AaABAg

"the matrix's storyline being an obscure and symbolic movie about trannies would make the movie of a generation a massive deception and repulsive disappointment, but seeing as these two brothers are now trannies I suppose it kind of could be.

It surely has enough philosophical and existential themes to leave the tranny stuff out and still have a ton of valuable themes of tremendous intellectual potential. It definitely speaks to me as an allegory for the reality of tyranny and increasing psychological, political, and physical control. I mean I think about it, and this film has totally influenced my life in a huge way I use the term ""red pilled"" all the time to describe the information sheeple so called (the average joe) aren't aware of, and the things that go on in our world behind the backs of us all.

"The whole argument of this video in summary, is that the end can be justified, even if the means arent; and my point is that the means don't need to be justified. 

I watched 40 minutes of a guy going in circles trying to justify liking the Transformers movie despite the “commercial greed” behind it. This guy's attitude is that Hasbro killing off a lot of the Transformers was a result of greed more than it was typical marketing. I see a narrative related reason behind that. I think raising the stakes is necessary for a narrative to be memorable, otherwise the movie would have just been a really long Transformers episode. Although I admit that they killed off a rather lot of characters, but again, it wasn't just because of this assumed “greed” from Hasbro. Transformers is primarily a toy focused entity and it makes sense that they wanted to pitch for new toys.

But my main point rather, is his criticism of commercialism. He seemed conflicted, although acknowledging the fact that his childhood was heavily influenced by commercialism all while denouncing commercialism as a whole as being “toxic”. And my question is, why? I think this is correlated with the typical cynical left wing attitude about capitalism. That the consumer is always being exploited. And the consumer buying something is him simply allowing himself to be exploited. This is simply a very dense and irrational perspective.

That's a part of the irony of his rant. He seems to emphasize the ultimate value of the Transformers movie, but just that the means of its production was “dishonest” and a “result of toxic commercialism”. What I found funny about this is the ironic inadvertent rationalization of capitalism. “It's almost as if the consumer gets something out of it in the end.”

Btw I think the critics criticized the movie for being a 90 minute commercial to the extent that they were too blatant about it, not the fact that Transformers is indeed a commercialized entity to begin with. He has the impression that Transformers is not inherently a franchise primarily marketing toys.",0,0,2018-07-03T01:37:53.000Z,PV Pike Mence,UCzJ9itPA3HB18Jt1c-zpxLA,_9iab0z6Kyg,True,Ugw6JVjQw_b9v3vDp4d4AaABAg

My proposal? The Doctor Doom movie should be the Sue movie. Have Franklin and Valeria already be born, so the main thrust of the film is Doom being Valeria’s godfather, which could provide excellent conflict for Sue.

"Another reason the Dark Knight Returns stuff doesn't work in this situation. In the comic he designed his whole plan so that Superman, and himself would be on par with one another. The amount of kryptonite he used, and how it was delievered vs Batman's suit: how it was built, what metals to use, and how thick. All those factors put them on even ground. Even if those factors weren't specifically stated in that comic they still are kinda understood. If he didn't need the armor then it wouldn't be a part of the story. All of this is coming from a Bruce who has fought along side, and maybe even against a couple times the Superman that is part of his universe. The Batman in BvS is wearing armor for ""reasons"". How did he think up the design? How does he know it's the correct amount of protection? How does he even know he needs armor in the first place? Maybe I missed some dialog where it's stated that he has to survive long enough for the kryptonite to take effect. But even so couldn't he just do the dodging manuevers he did in the Doomsday confrontation? They made him an older Batman with no patience for bullshit, long winded plans, acrobatics, or martial arts. He relied heavily on his gadgets. Again which is why alot of his stuff in that comic, was guns. To old; beat down; and tired to swing down, and place a tracker. Just use a high powered rifle, and shoot it. And agian that is probably why they added some of that in the movie just to emphasize that this is an older Batman.

"I think next year's Dark Phoenix movie is supposed to actually have the team go to space where Jean gets the Fire Bird but... I'm not sure how good a movie it will be considering how honestly the main focus of the movie is still supposed to be on other characters.  But instead of Wolverine it's suppose to be on Magneto and Xavier and Mystique and... ugh the writers don't seem to get that you need to get people to really care about and be fully invested in Jean Grey and get to know her first before you do the whole fucking Dark Phoenix.  The other movies couldn't do it because they had to give so much time to Wolverine and that has at best gotten only slightly better with the prequels now focusing on totally different casts.  That kind of thing works in the comics as even if you didn't have like a bunch of previous storylines developing Jean Grey before that you still had her appear and got to see her in like nearly 20 years of comics before they really delved into the Phoenix stuff.  Thus you had a good base line with the character to do that.  It's again why rushing Dark Knight Rises and Death of Superman so quickly in BvS was so dumb: you have to establish the characters first before you get to really run wild with some of the more out there ideas.  I didn't ever really care about Jean in the original movies, and didn't care much for Jean in Apocalypse.  I didn't watch much of the 90's cartoon but that clearly knew how to wait and honestly if Evolution had more time I'm sure even it would of had a much better full Dark Phoenix story then these movies ever could.

"This show will fail simply because of the fact that  people are fans of shit, and when you are dealing with and established intellectual property  that doesn't have as many incarnations as properties like;Transformers, or characters in DC universe, that will insure that the IP will survive a Micheal Bay, or a Teen Titans Go situation, then you don't fuck with the fan base because that is your bread and butter. What they are doing is the same as what happened with Ghostbusters 2016, what just happen with the Star Wars franchise, and what would happen  if Nintendo decided to make a gender swap, SJW politics laced  Super Mario Bros game that watered the concept down so much that the game became a caricature of itself, and when  gamers called BS on them disrespecting the IP, Nintendo doubling down, telling the fans who nostalgia for the original IP they intended to, and needed to ride to new consumers, that; ""This is aimed at kids, grow up, get off of the couch in your moms basement, and go get a girl friend, a job, and a life! "" Would you still spend your money buying products from Nintendo?  Would you go see the new Star Wars movie? Would you sit down with your kids and watch the new TV show or approve of them watching it? I didn't think so. 

Thundercats is not a property that has had as many incarnations as other cartoons from the 70's and 80's like Transformers, and Scooby Doo: and Teen Titan's Go, has the whole continuity of the vast DC universe to draw from. Those properties can survive an asinine incarnation of itself. Nintendo and Super Mario Bros would likely survive a horrible installment of that game, but Thundercat's core fan base  starts from 40ish  and go all the way to their mid to late teen for those that remember the 2011 reboot, and those are the only two versions of the IP you have to choose from, a long with a few comic books; so this hot mess, dressed up as a Thundercats reboot aimed at younger children, could shelve the IP permanently.

"Huh, came here looking for a legitimate reason to revisit my love for X-Men 2 (the one before the First Class series) but found absolutely no hard criticism except a general feeling of distaste for the aesthetic choices which, I admit, were pretty bad.

And yeah, my love for DoFP and AoA is absolutely grounded in how enraged and violated I felt by the Last Stand, a movie that managed to be both bland and forgettable while also making me hate every character put on screen.  It made me hate  Kelsey Grammar for something other than his personal and political stances, and that is just something I cannot abide.

Hoooh, okay; rant over.  I come not to bury Bob but to praise him.  He's absolutely my favorite movie critic and I love the way he makes me think more deeply about the movies I love and challenges me on questionable opinions and (other than A Cure for Wellness, which was good but not nearly the abominably entertaining squickfest I was hoping for per his review) he's been pretty absolutely spot on in his takes.

So, I know you don't owe me anything and I know this is like your real job for which you've got to prioritize the stuff that will actually make you money and balance that against flippin everything else... but, in the words of the entitled millennial you've correctly pegged me as; can you tell me why X-Men 2 is so bad that it's actively a negative for the progress of translating comic book stories to the screen?

"Perhaps it's because I've never been starstruck (I didn't care who was the most popular girl/biggest sports star/most famous hometown celebrity), perhaps it's because I never identified with any one group (racial/ethnic/gender/etc.), but I've never understood the tendency for a group of people to flock to a movie because there are people who look like them in it. Act like them, think like them, hail from the same specific geographic location, maybe, but never because they LOOK the same. I don't like to make assumptions, but that is often as deep as this particular fascination seems to go. Tyler Perry's original works, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Spy Kids apparently (I needed three) -- these movies seem to draw ethnic audiences for no other reason than the ethnicity of the characters. I'm not saying that that's inherently a bad thing, I just personally look for more depth in my entertainment than ""Hey, that person's skin tone is similar to mine!"" 

And that's setting aside the importance of promoting minority cinema -- trying to show the suits which concept is and isn't bankable. But just like the fear that ""Catwoman didn't do so well, so we should never make a female-led superhero movie EVER AGAIN"" is the incorrect message Hollywood should take away from such a debacle, it's also not really helpful to artificially inflate the numbers on a dud like ""The Mummy"" just to keep the Dark Universe on track. Then we end up with more movies that make the same mistakes under the assumption that THAT is what we wanted. Don't stress too much about it. It has been my experience that Hollywood is going to learn the wrong lesson no matter what. (In the case of The Mummy, they made ONE mixed message of a movie, then gave up? That's the wrong take-away, surely. At least WB is still hammering away at their shared DC universe idea, and maybe they'll find a shape that works.)",0,0,2018-06-25T11:06:37.000Z,Overseer76,UCKitSz9xhmmDISK4TGbIOPg,A56uPViecy0,True,Ugyz0JZ2hqvzBOljqt14AaABAg

I would say that two straight whites guys can have very different views in some respects, for example if you want to go in that vein I'd say you in Trump have very different opinions. But if you take two people from a similar area that went to the same school all their lives the only difference one is a bi black woman and the other is a straight white man, they will likely after on more things. The thing that really makes me think with this is the use of other races as characters and normalizing them. I think that is really strong and useful to normalizing others to the culture. However, when it's painfully obvious that the character is there to be a token it hurts. They aren't a character they are a check box and they haven't been formed into a character they are just a token to say they have them.

It's a terrible thing that these children are being separated from their parents, but under the 2016 ruling by the statute of the 9th circuit of appeals it was unconstitutional to keep them with their parents, so they separated them. Which even under Obama lead to massive amounts of children being given to slavers, and other human rights abuses. And the reality of the situation is all of the people in these centers tried to cross illegally, and then asked for amnesty. If they went to a border crossing or another legal route they wouldn't have to touch those camps.

"I don't get it. Can't everyone use Youtube these days? If girls want to critique movies they can, can't they? Just like Asians can write about other movies than those specifically marketed to Asian. I really don't see the issue here. 

I only know that some high up animal at Marvel wrote something about the next 20 Marvel movies being mostly directed by women, which makes me worry. We already saw what social justice did to the Marvel comic book sales figures. Not to mention Star Wars. Anything this social justice stuff touches dies a horrible death. 

About the ""concentration camp"" as you called it. I did some research on it, and it really doesn't seem anything the way you make it out to be. Also there is the argument of not even knowing if those children actually belong to the parents they were separated from.

"I feel that part of what you’re talking is what I would call the difference between a film review and a film critic or film analysis. I would say that a film review should ultimately tell “do you think a film is worth watch and why” without harming the first time experience of said film with spoilers. I say “and why” because that can sometimes clue me in as to weather I myself will enjoy the content. I also try to get multiple opinions because that can clue me in better. 

A film analysis is more about deconstructing the film as to help better appreciate why I feel the way I do or to gain a new insight into the movie.

A film review of empire strikes back might say how the film maintains the fantastic action scenes in a new hope while raising the stakes and gives us a deeper look at our heroes and villains.
A film analysis of above film might have to comment on how we see Luke defining himself as a Jedi and freedom fighter as a ay to connect to the father he’s never known and that this makes it all the more devastating when he learns that his father has really turned to evil and makes it all the more heroic when Luke chooses to make his own path and fight for his friends.",0,0,2018-06-23T04:44:55.000Z,Dingus343,UC3MbasafyHiACZgTswllQ1w,A56uPViecy0,True,Ugz29L5OJfzyD_k-yV14AaABAg

"I guess this explains why the recent Star Wars movies have been so racist yet critics have loved them even as audiences have not and btw MovieBob, Disney Star Wars is NOT ""SJW."" In fact it's quite racist.
It's true that the first of the original Star Wars trilogy didn't have many people of color (EXCEPT for James Earl Jones whom I will remind you, was NOT established as white until the Empire Strikes Back.) However, George Lucas sought to remedy this problem and found one of the coolest black actors he could find to play Lando Calrissian, a City Administrator who went on to get a big role as a rebel general in The Return of The Jedi in which he piloted the Millennium Falcon and destroyed the Second Death Star.
In contrast, in the start of the Disney Star Wars trilogy has a very racist subtext. Instead of Lando Calrissian, we get Fin, the cowardly space janitor. A very weak and even contemptible character who, rather than being a disillusioned soldier as the trailers seemed to promise, is just a cowardly space janitor willing to murder his former comrades in order to get away from the scary battle.
In contrast, white people in this film include the most OP character ever, Rey who can pilot starships better than trained pilots and win a lightsaber dual the the Emperor's apprentice despite never having been trained in either piloting or light-saber combat. She can also of course, do everything better than the black character Fin. Indeed, the fact that she can fight better than Fin who is supposed to have actual military training is actually far more absurd than the idea of her being able to win a fight against an injured Kylo Ren.
Rogue One is a yawn but it's still very racist. The main characters are disreputable Hispanic spy who shoots his friends in the back, a black rebel leader with child soldiers (the film mentioned that a certain character was ""his best fighter"" when she was sixteen years old) and of course, a morally perfect white woman who is so awesome that she succeeds at everything despite having no will of her own and eventually succombing to a studio mandate that everyone had to die...
Oh! There was also a blind Asian monk who said mystical stuff and fought with a quarter-staff... in Star Wars. He could have easily been an Asian Jedi with a dual-ended lightsaber but I guess ""blind shaolin monk with a staff"" sounded more racist so that's what they went with.
The Last Jedi is the most racist mainstream film since the black robots who can't read in a certain Transformers atrocity. Rey is now effectively invincible and people of color... well they added ANOTHER menial laborer in a very unflattering pair of work coveralls who in her own words ""works behind pipes all day.""
Of course, the film goes way down from here. Stereo-typically hotheaded Hispanic Poe's whole character arc consists of being humiliated by an elitist white woman who seems to hate him irrationally (I'm pretty sure she voted for Trump because of that border wall thing) the final lesson he learns being ""don't challenge the authority of the white lady"" no matter how incompetent she is.
But wait? Maybe this isn't really about racism. Maybe it's just about trying to elevate female characters. While it's true that there are no men in Disney Star Wars who really seem to be worthwhile heroes, the clearly racist subtext of this film can even be seen in comparisons of female characters.
At the beginning of The Last Jedi, an Asian woman with a lot of support (some of it coming from Poe Dameron) sacrifices herself to take out ONE ship. At the end of the film, a much higher ranking white woman with no support sacrifices herself and wrecks AN ENTIRE FLEET in the most ridiculously OP special effects shots since Starkiller base in the last movie.
Paige, Rey and Rose all had ordinary parents. Why is it that only one of them gets to become the most powerful being in the galaxy? (Psst! It's because she's white.)
Even women of color are devalued in comparison to white women in these truly appalling films so no, it's not feminism destroying Star Wars. It's racist, Mary Sue fan-fiction destroying Star Wars.
I don't know or care if the makers of these films are accidentally racist, deliberately racist, or just so racist that they don't realize how racist they are.

"The thing is it's totally character accurate for Star Lord to be unable to hold back his emotions.

On the other hand, the movie kind of makes it seem like they would have won had he not lost his crap, but the truth is; even if he hadn't, once they remove the gauntlet Thanos' hand is free to knock out Mantis, Star Lord and Dr Strange (foiling the using a portal to diss the gauntlet idea).

I see what your all doing but these cultures are not synonymous with the ethnicity that founded them. For instance plenty of Asian-Americans born and raised in the states would not have had any cultural understanding of that street gang bit in dead or alive despite their lineage. I can see the barrage of slurs coming my way but I assure you I’m explicitly not concerned about anyone’s ethnicity as There is not a single quality among any ethnicity that is both universal and worthy of moral consideration. I’m also not the one making an issue of what ethnicity anyone is here. 

As a side note those “concentration camps” have been going on since like 2015 so perhaps that isn’t the only president who should be shown in all fairness.

"I actually think there are movies that are made for people with certain life experiences.  A recent example I can think of is, ""Tully"", which I personally did not connect with.  I figured it out the plot early on, so while it's objectively a well made and acted film it just left me feeling a bit empty.  However, while watching it I also thought that someone who's dealt with depression (not necessarily their own) more than I have might get much more out of it than I did.

I will say I think the best films can convey that message without requiring that background, but that doesn't invalidate making ones that are more relatable to people that do.

The left are shameless liers in this immigration debate.  The same facilities housing the children of illegal aliens were used during the Obama admin and nobody raised a fuss.  These same facilities have comfortable beds, basketball courts, and other comforts. TO COMPARE THAT TO NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMPS DEMONSTRATES YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ABUSE THE HORRORS OF THE HOLOCAUST FOR YOUR OWN POLITICAL AGENDA! 

STOP using photos of detention facilities.  The children of illegal aliens are NOT housed there.  They're taken to the more comfortable housing facilities.  By howling about separation, you are saying that the children should stay in the detention facilities with their criminal parents(yes crossing the border unlawfully is a crime).  BTW it's illegal for the government to do so, so the left is howling for the government to act illegally.

Because no kids movie or show is ever truly made for the adults that might critique it. And as for children well Hollywood has spent way to much time trying to figure each successive generation on what they might like or why they didn't or did like something. Then there's the idea that even if kids like something a parent might not deem it appropriate for them. So would something aim towards kids be successful if kids liked it even if it wasn't necessarily good or even appropriate for them to watch? Is it MORE successful both parents and kids enjoy it?

"I would personally be a lot more enthusiastic about diversity if Hollywood’s initiatives seemed genuine. But... I honestly don’t get the impression that Hollywood execs really care. Sure they’ll give lip service to the idea but they rarely go beyond the bare minimum. 

We often end up with films marketed to mostly white demographics that are sprinkled with a slew of token support characters that serve little purpose beyond ‘filling all the boxes.’ 

Films that fully express and celebrate the cultures neglected in the history of the medium are far more interesting than films that merely accessorize those cultures out of an obligation to be ‘diverse.’

"Hey, it's been a while but I wholeheartedly agree with Bob here. In an age where what most people see in terms of movie criticism is a RT score, I think it's important to have a plethora of perspectives comprising that number and also for those of us who do read reviews, to have reviews with more insight into the cultural aspects of movies.

Bob doesn't go into this much and i bet we would disagree on this point, but, I think the disparity between male and female movie critics (and other disparities) is more down to personal choice than some sort of obstacle for women to become critics and that's a shame. The reason i think this is that there are many avenues to become a bonafide movie critic. Getting hired by a publication is not the only way anymore (this is assuming publications do discriminate, which i don't think is the case). So we ""should"" see a closer split if there was equal interest in the field from both genders.
This is all to suggest that getting that parity could be an unreachable goal, or at least one that would need heavy quotas which I am against (i meant it when i said it's been a while since I've agreed with Bob).

"One thing that gets overlooked in conversations about representation in either media or media criticism, is that minority individuals usually grow up with mostly media featuring people who are different to them, and so learn to empathize and identify with people of different backgrounds to them. Whereas cis white straight men often grow up with media that predominantly features other cis white straight male characters, and so any time a movie or something comes out that’s promoted as being for everyone (Star Wars, for example) that doesn’t feature a cis white straight man as the main character, those consumers feel as though they don’t have someone to identify with, while the rest of us can usually find something to identify with even when the characters are different to us in big ways. That’s why movies with male protags are for everyone, and movies with female protags are called “chick flicks”. Men are usually used to being catered too, and so many lack the skill to empathize with female characters in the same way that women can usually empathize with male characters.

It's not only important which film you're writing about or what you're saying about it, but also which films you compare it to, what your references are from movie (and all art) history. From the millions of films that have been made, there's a grouping of ten thousand or so (depends where you stop counting) that are ""held up"" by the film writing community as setting the bar for quality, and without a diversity of voices involved, the art that reflects marginalized perspectives will sink further down the list or never be discovered. I never heard about the challenging and brilliant 1972 French film Jeanne Diellman before a decade ago, but now it regularly shows up somewhere in the top few hundred films of all time, if not near the top of such a survey. It's a clarion call for feminist filmmaking. That kind of shit is way, way more important than Captain Marvel's Meta Critic score and whether that impacts box office numbers.

"I’ll put it this way.

I wouldn’t hire the average American writer to do an in-depth review of a magic-realist film from Columbia. Why? Because there is a whole universe of cultural subtext involved in that form of media that the average American viewer will not have enough knowledge about to make their review insightful enough to warrant anything other than a ‘outsiders take’. Under this notion, this criticism leveled against critic’s demographics can make a whole lot of sense. There are aspects of subculture that, for someone not steeped in their traditions nor taking part in their conversations, the average outsider will have no idea are noteworthy or even included in the art. These are important aspects of an insightful and nuanced review. If you want a good review of an action film, you’ll want someone who’s watched more than the Transformers series. That person’s benchmark for action will be either “it did things similar to the action scenes I have seen before, thus it was well handled” or “It did these things dissimilar, and it didn’t bother me, so it’s better from my perspective. To what degree, I can’t know for sure.”

If art should be judged based on its larger cultural context, then people with awareness of that context can’t hurt to have on board.

I doubt having more black critics involved in the industry during the release of A Wrinkle in Time would’ve helped its perception all that much, but I can bet their take on how the movie handled its sentimentality and espousing self-confidence would’ve been delved into more deeply and held a larger part in the analysis—especially how it relates to the film‘s goals as compared to its execution.",0,0,2018-06-22T03:40:51.000Z,UltimateKyuubiFox,UCPbtSrh4YNeFn0PCtu9QJUQ,A56uPViecy0,True,Ugz2kuGoEBA4CSyxodB4AaABAg

"4 me, the reason for more diverse film critics or more inclusive film criticism isn't JUST to add some maybe foreign context to a film that some viewers are just incapable of relating to (although that is VERY important as well) but it also goes a long way when talking about the types of films get canonized as the things ppl hold dear and champion for years to come.

So many of the movies ppl hold as modern ""classics"" what ever that means, are viewed through the lens of very white, very straight, and very male demo.  I love The Dark Knight, Children of Men, Serenity, Spider-man 2, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, There Will Be blood, Inglorious Basterds and the like, but there is no reason why films like Inside Man, Clueless, or It Follows shouldn't be in those same convos.

I think because the straight white dude demo dominates MOST of film criticism their experiences, and their POV kind of dictate what gets remembered, and whats considered substantial.  I'm a big fan of the man Kevin Smith but so many of the film podcasts I listen to still hold Clerks up as a representation of a certain type of 90s male (its aight) while completely ignoring the fact that a film like Friday exists (probably haven't even seen it) and (even Smith himself has said this) acts almost like a black slant on clerks in terms of a day in the life of 2 deadbeat dudes.  They treat THEIR culture as the one to b remembered (which I understand, but it still bums me out).

I don't need them to LOVE Friday the way I do and see value and truth in a film like LOTTERY TICKET like I do, but because all they care about is Tarantino, Clerks, Fight Club and PTA before he became something truly special (I'm looking at you Boogie Nights) we develop a taste that only values those kinds of things.  I don't want women critics just so Ava Duvernay's movies can get good reviews, I want more of them so they can tell me why that movie or Lady Bird or (THE AMAZING) Mistress America or the babadook is SHOULD be held in the same esteem as the Aliens and Blade Runners of the world.

"I mean, I saw Wrinkle in Time and I was kind of... underwhelmed. I don't see how a different gender or ethnicity would make me look past those flaws. I can only speak from one point of view, but isn't that the same for us all? My problems stem from me being an avid consumer of media, one who values the messages behind films, and from my views of evil. Those things are so inherent to me that I would actually be horrified if being raised with a different set of bits would change any of that.

SPOILERS I thought that the three wise women could easily have been narrowed to one from a narrative perspective. The one who spoke in only quotes contributed basically nothing and I hated how mean the mean one was.

Wasn't she supposed to be some kind of goddess like being powered by and filled with compassion to drive away the darkness? The darkness struck me as a lose metaphor for feeling bad, being mean, succumbing to humanities darker emotions, etc. and this jerk seemed to be more of an agent of that terribly defined darkness then anything.

Speaking of which I didn't like the darkness either. I hate nebulus ""this is all the evil in the world"" antagonists. Those are basically big nothings that the protagonist just needs to roll up to and then overcome their own demons adjacent to. It boils down all negative human emotion to an outside force acting on people, which I also vehemently dislike as a concept. Some things shouldn't be externalized, some things come from within, and have to be dealt with internally. I hate how it makes everything in the world black and white, this is the good, this is the evil.

I did like how they didn't make the father basically Jesus. He was an overconfident scientist who tangled with forces he didn't quite understand. He had the kind of drive that pushed science forward, but its also a dangerous drive. I get that this is supposed to be a simple story for kids and that I'm too old for it, but it also seems like the kind of story that is meant to be universal, and I believe my problems with it are legitimate. I get how the clone of the main girl was supposed to play on peer pressure in highschool, but I have no idea how this girl could ever wish to be as mean as her clone, she was never a bad kid and she never seemed to want to be more cruel and catty. I think Wrinkle in Time was a bad example, and I don't know if there is a good one.",0,0,2018-06-22T01:07:37.000Z,gamingspacemonkey,UCZyTz6N_9FEBBFXAFw3Stjw,A56uPViecy0,True,UgyAgYozggvsJa0DxPR4AaABAg

"6:47 The problem with this point here is that I'm a white man, so whatever hypothetical movie I'd recall, whatever reasons I'd cite as to why I'd like it, that doesn't matter because I'm a part of the 53% of film critics that Larson says is too much. Mine are the opinions and perspectives that she says she wants less of. It doesn't matter whether or not I lift, am an aspiring musician, or come from a military family because, as far as Brie Larson is concerned, my being a white man is a point against my perspectives as to whether or not they should be the ones that are shared with the wider public.

And the ""Dead or Alive"" example is strange because, given that it's a Japanese movie that released in Japan, for Japanese audiences specifically, Bob is the one with the minority perspective, which should mean that he's the one with the unique perspective that's worth listening to. But instead, we get an example of the outsider's perspective not only being not-particularly-unique, but also his lack of understanding as an outsider causing him to miss a crucial element of the story. 

If the purpose of that story was to point out where minority voices need to amplified in film criticism, it's not a good one. I also think it secretly informs what Brie and Bob mean when they talk about this. It's not purely for the sake of voices or perspectives that are different from the majority, it really is just a statement of ""we want less film criticism from white men dominating 'the discourse.'""",14,17,2018-06-22T00:57:51.000Z,KingofSting19,UCU8tPE5wdZ164krq0tWuLRw,A56uPViecy0,True,Ugwp7JCOqeCci-WPNBt4AaABAg

"The problem with perception of her argument (and the entire reboot of the Marvel comic universe) is essentially summarized by you calling the detainment centers ""concentration camps"" - massive hyperbole. 
Unless they are far right, no white person goes around saying ""I dont want to see black people in movies"". No guy walks around saying ""women shouldnt act"". The problem is that there was this sudden and massive shove to embrace diversity without giving it proper ""who gives a damn"" status. You know who is the best example? Nick Fury. Oh, look, he is black. Wait, he used to be white? Didnt know that. What about Blind Al? He used to be a dude, now its a woman.

"I fail to understand why anyone would think, ""More opinions from more people"" is wrong when it comes to a field like film/tv/art/game criticism when
A) Having opinions is the whole point of the field. 
B) A wider pool of people with different backgrounds would allow YOU the view to find someone who might agree with you on something few others do. 
C) More people of different color / gender means more job opportunities for said people who otherwise might not have that opportunity. 

Anyone who thinks that's wrong clearly isn't looking outside their own personal bubble. And, yes, the idea that ""this film isn't made for you"" is a problematic line of thinking because anyone can enjoy any film (just some on a deeper level than others). But I admit there is some ""truth"" to that sentiment, even if the idea wasn't fully established by Brie Larson per the context of your video. As you've said many times, Spiderman Homecoming isn't a movie you particularly enjoyed, but you also admit it wasn't really made with you in mind. I find Black Panther to be more on the ""okay"" side of things, but I'm aware I'm not the target audience for that film. And I can't stand the Cars movies, while loving most other pixar films, but I understand that I am totally not who those films are made for and my opinion on them likely won't stop the people who those films ARE for from seeing them.

It had nothing to do with critics being old white guys (most critics are actually progressively minded leftists).

There are different reasons to like different stuff and understanding and analysing is what critics should do instead of tomato scores.

"I... really don't like the last Jedi. I can see where Bob is coming from, but the movie fails to portray many of the themes Bob mentions here. The force has always manifested pretty randomly, Poe being told to shut up and not be a hero doesn't make sense in context, and Luke almost killing Kylo Ren seems not moody and impulsive but like a non-sequitor. It does not follow that ""I sense evil in Kylo Ren, I must attempt to murder Kylo Ren"". That is not an emotional or logical leap that makes any sense. And Luke knows that the Jedi/Sith dichotomy will continue since Ren and Snoke are out there. What does he think he is achieving with his exile, again? I know that Bob isn't a lore guy, and so I haven't brought up any of the flaws from that perspective, and trust me, they are legion. But in terms of characters, I didn't connect with any of them in the way the story wanted me to. Poe learned a lesson that he didn't need to, Finn learned a lesson that it seemed like he learned in the last movie, only to get told it was wrong by someone who was pushing it on him, and Rey should've already known how to overcome disappointment based on her backstory from the previous film.",0,1,2018-06-21T23:24:26.000Z,tesnacloud,UCPB24DRJy4jCYNFhRj4T-WA,bxDX-nywiTc,True,UgyZowoVGvvvVoyGYPd4AaABAg

"As a straight white man, even I get tired of this perceived victimhood you see from other straight white dudes who think everything is gonna change overnight because some movie/show/person is celebrated because it touches on some cultural touchstone of the time(like now it would be the push for more non- straight white guy voices,the me too movement, black lives matter).

I respond to the stories of disempowerment, violence, ignorance, and etc. I might not get it on the cultural level persay, but I don't need to enjoy it on every single level to like something.

"What Brie Larson said determine someone's input value based on their immutable characteristics it is fundamentally anti-human.  I don't think white men are hurt by what she said, I think everybody else is hurt by what she said even if they don't know it.  

White men don't tend to take their self worth from being white males in the same way that every other demographic seems to find their value in their immutable traits.  Larson is basically asking for token people.  People who's reason for being there first and foremost is sex/gender/race etc not their actual contributions.

"Yeah, this is right on the money, and you are actually an example of that for me, Bob. Your review of Wreck-It Ralph was basically ""it's good and funny"", whereas I ended up seeing it second run and sobbed through the entire second half. As someone who struggles constantly with mental health, the entire film was obvious as a metaphor for mental health, trauma, and abuse, with an impressively subtle message layered in the more obvious stuff: King Candy literally abused Vanellope by fucking her code up. This gave her ""pixlexia"" - maybe a throwaway joke, but in the movies world, it's straight up a disability. She tries to cure or run away from it, but in the end, she is able to prevail, not through suppressing it, but working with it. This is still fairly standard. The kicker is that when the day is won, memories and code restored... She still has her disability. Defeating her abuser didn't make it go away. It is now an intrinsic part of herself, but she has learned how to live with it.

None of which was touched on in your review - which is fine! But this was the first time I had the experience where I felt like a film was saying things that I didn't see any reviewer talking about. And knowing all that perspective is not necessary to say whether you should see the movie, but it is a worthwhile part of the post seeing it discussion.

"Oh, bollocks to this. No one is stopping women or people of all races and religions from becoming critics. It's not like it's a fucking exclusive club destined only to white men. Any pleb can film himself ranting about a movie and post it on YT and bang, he's instantly a critic. You want to become a certified professional critic? Even that is easy nowadays, since most film and theater schools pertaining to most universities now have entire distinct branches dedicated to teaching people this particular profession instead of acting or directing. What's stopping them from going to one of these? Or run of the mill journalists that have up until now written about anything else can just branch out and start stating their opinions on films and thus become critics. Seriously...what's stopping them? There aren't many critics outside the ""dreaded"" white male demographic simply because people from outside this particular demographic are much less interested in this endeavour. And that's an objective fact that has nothing to do with racism or inclusion. It just is what it is. You can't fucking force someone to become a movie critic, if they don't want to, just because he/she has the desired skin color or genitalia in their pants. There are very few professions that have a 50-50 ratio of men to women, because in the case of most, one or the other sexes has a less degree of interest in that particular field. Who cares? Let women do what they want to do and men as well. Seriously...DUMB statement is dumb...

Now, I'm not necessarily saying she was wrong about more variety being needed, but there really isn't a solution to this dilemma (if you can even call it that), cause the people who decide who gets to be a critic are...the critics themselves (those who become new critics, not the already existing ones, cause like I said, it's not an invitation-based gentlemen's club), so don't turn this thing into some kind of SJW bollocks agenda, please!",0,2,2018-06-21T22:58:20.000Z,Madalin Grama,UCc36p_1u0XK8nAUw9Xp25sA,A56uPViecy0,True,UgwFhGbVkuz3fPqQtqZ4AaABAg

Scott Pilgrim, but you've already seen it a 100 times. Still, one more won't hurt.

Great actress, proved herself in all types of roles. Also good singer. Also beautiful woman.

"Okay, nobody asked for my two cents, but I've been thinking about the defenders for a long time now, and what should have been changed. We're all agreed that the Hand and Elektra were a mistake for a villain, which begs the question of who would be their replacement. The answer is simple. The Wrecking Crew, which debuted in The Defender's anyway. Each member of the team could be a foil for one of the defenders member. The Wrecker would fight Daredevil, Bulldozer fights Luke Cage, Thunderball and JJ fight, and Piledriver and Iron fist fight. The origin can even stay the same, with maybe the Tinkerer augmenting the Wrecking Crew's gear. We can still have the Odd Couple dynamic of this defender meats that defender, but this way each member gets a definitive fight where they can shine and maybe grow a little. We could even tie it back to Fisk and Cottonmouth and other gangs leaders of New York (like Tombstone).

"I'm going to piss people off.

Blade Runner is a terrible adaptation even if it is a good movie.

I used to be one of those purist fans who wanted as much of the source material preserved and duplicated as possible. Over the years I've relaxed and realized that as long as they don't fuck with the underlying theme and make a good movie, it's all good. When that change happened, I started to realize that Blade Runner is a terrible adaptation because it *reverses* the theme, thus violating it in the most profound way possible.

The original story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep was inspired by the author finding out that Germans who lived near the concentration camps complained about the noise. They lived near one of the greatest war crimes of all time and their primary concern was that it interfered with their sleep. Philip K Dick was disturbed that beings who seemed like ordinary humans were actually monsters. And that's what the story is supposed to be about: the fear of finding out that monsters live among us.

Blade Runner completely reverses the underlying theme and treats the replicants as sympathetic beings. The monsters were turned into a metaphor for an abused minority forced to endure short, brutal lives. In other words, Ridley Scott turned the Nazis of the story into Jews.

So.

Yeah.

Great movie, terrible adaptation.",0,0,2018-06-17T02:31:14.000Z,Paul T Sjordal,UC4JiE-d3K9WA3ow6_6G_dYw,Ap28L5MPLlo,True,UgynC5d8C6u07Z0ccxd4AaABAg

"Amazing how times have changed. A Gen X fella like me can look back on a time (not too long ago) when you could ask a kid, ""Which would you rather see? A movie with Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman? Or a movie with Iron Man, Captain America and Thor?"" And kids would have said, ""Who's Iron Man? Who's Thor? I've heard of Captain America but what's his powers?"" NOW the mere idea of taking on the Avengers at the box office is a major risk for a filmmaker and potential career suicide. One decade changed EVERYTHING. 

I wonder if things would be different if Christopher Nolan weren't so dead-set against allowing references to other superheroes into his Dark Knight films. What if Man of Steel were allowed to happen in that universe? And what if, instead of the Batman v Superman we got, it were a film where the same Batman from Nolan's trilogy comes out of retirement? (Played by a new actor but the same guy.) Then we'd KNOW him. And the movie would feel waaaaaay more.... right.

"Great video!  I think one reason most critics were really, really hard on this one was because they couldn't wrap their head around such a kid-oriented, ""childish"" story being given a $50 million superproduction -- by '80s standards that was huge.  Maybe it was a hangover from New Hollywood and its distinct laser focus on adult audiences, but critics in the '80s tended to come down hard on movies directly aimed at families, period, the odd ""E.T."", ""Star Wars"" sequel, or Muppet movie aside.  (They eased up by the end of the decade; see how well ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" was received.)  ""Labyrinth"", released by the same studio less than a year after this, was largely roasted too and grossed half of what this film did.  And like this movie, try to explain the plot to a newbie and you will get some raised eyebrows.

It's fascinating to look at this film now and see how it plays the story completely straight, especially in the second half and even more so with Dudley Moore's performance as Patch, which I find absolutely charming (his scenes with Lithgow are high points).   ""Let's put the A-list comedy star of the moment in our kids movie!"" can easily end in catastrophe -- the actor can end up a bland straight man to CGI (Eddie Murphy from ""Doctor Dolittle"" onwards) or at the other extreme they'll ham it up and their presence encourages the filmmakers to get ""hip"" and ""meta"" and ""edgy"" at the expense of the story (the live-action Dr. Seuss adaptations, especially ""The Cat in the Hat"").  Neither happens here, and while I understand the argument that he doesn't get enough to do,  I think it's the best choice for the actor and the film.

Any fans of this film should try tracking down the excellent novelization, which has tons of additional scenes and backstory.  There was real thought put into the worldbuilding here.",0,0,2018-06-16T03:26:40.000Z,Rori Stevens,UCwIf1V9Pkj4WaLxosDvr6yQ,uNI-H3WpUpo,True,UgyjEfDq734jCDizGzF4AaABAg

"My biggest problem with that moment really had less to do with why Star Lord did it.  The whole thing just felt cliched to me, and something that I've seen too many times before.

One of the few times where I thought it was well executed was in Season 3 of Avatar: The Last Airbender.  When they invaded the Fire Nation during the eclipse, Azula was trying to distract Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Toph to keep them away from Ozai until the eclipse was over.  Sokka realized this, and tried to disengage, but then Azula taunted him by mentioning Suki.  Even though we knew where this was going, it made more sense, because Azula is a psychopath and it makes sense that she would know what buttons to press to manipulate him.

Here, however, it just felt not only predictable, but far too convenient.  Not an act of manipulation on Thanos' part, but an actual fuckup on Star Lord's part in a way that didn't really work for me.  It would have made more sense if he had just kept it together a little longer so that he could have his way with him after the gauntlet was removed and Thanos would be vulnerable.  I wish they could have found a different way to have Thanos regain the upper hand.

"The idea of the Matrix was simple and universal:  We present ourselves to the world in such a way that the world demands of us, and that under it we are different people; our 'true' selves.  We struggle against what the world wants from us, and only very few actually find freedom from it.

Any personal struggle can fit inside the Matrix, that's why it remains culturally relevant even to this day.

The red-pill movement is a thing because realize it or not, you have a generation (if not two) of people that have been oppressed, told that they are worthless and perhaps downright evil; that their struggles are imaginary and not to be considered.  The shackles of oppression that were removed from the minorities weren't destroyed, they were placed on a different group of people.  That those who were freed in the past, have now become the agents of enforcement of a new Matrix. 

No one escapes the Matrix, there will always be a layer above to keep you trapped: It feeds you what it needs to keep the system running.  Those who become 'The One' will be used to create the new Matrix and a new generation of agents.  After all, that is ultimately the biggest criticism of the sequels:  They never took that final step and said ""It's just another Matrix within a Matrix"" the movies instead fed people what they needed to see: The happy ending, just like the first movie did.  Though all the clues are there to show that it's just a simulation inside a simulation, and ultimately the choice is left to the viewer to accept it; or reject it.",1,0,2018-06-10T19:48:43.000Z,rahn45,UCVpNhQn3DsGkdJSAEXHOchQ,LGopT-KNvlM,True,UgzCgsAGLqQMUC_pPSt4AaABAg

"Lex's plan?  Oh, that's easy.  He undermines everything Clark does from the behind the scenes while smuggling Kryptonite and creating DOOMSDAY.

It's for him, after he kills you at the end of another massive battle that drops half of the skyscrapers in the city again.  And then I WILL BECOME EARTH'S HERO. Me. A HUMAN. Not a FALSE GOD.""  Fast forward twenty minutes when Clark is seemingly dead and Lex unleashes the Kryptonite only to find out that DOOMSDAY is immune to it.  Clark then saves Lois, tells her that she's his world, and then goes and beats DOOMSDAY to death, just like the comics.

Only then Warner Bros. gave Snyder the go-ahead to add Batman and Diana to the movie. And then Batfleck had to steal the kryptonite to give him something to do. Basically, adding Batman to this film is the very first fatal flaw in the film, the point at which it automatically fails irredeemably.

"Here's a thought of how to improve a potential sequel: write characters who are remotely believable, rather than make poor attempts at comedy by trying to portray everyone except the main cast (and even at times failing to do that) as bumbling caricatures. As a highlight, I'd point to the main human antagonists of the original versus the new.

On the one hand, we have Peck, who more or less rolled into the original Ghostbusters just trying to do his job and being rudely brushed off by Venkman. Within the context of his job, his concern could've very well been that something environmentally harmful was going on, and his aggression towards the Ghostbusters was because they were telling him to buzz off when part of his job is dealing with matters that affect the health of the public at large.

Contrast, the government agents of the new. They could've been entirely reasonable and entertaining characters if their actions lined up at all with their words. Keep knowledge of actual ghosts out of the public eye to prevent panic? Okay, that's reasonable. But reason takes a back seat in the newer Ghostbusters if they think something will be ""funny"". Case in point, I strongly doubt that any government agent of any remotely serious capacity is going to lean out the window of a moving van just to extend a gag of, ""LOL, we're watching you, because we're the government. Isn't that just the funniest?""

Intent and execution, as this very channel has observed, matter. Where the original Ghostbusters worked by virtue of this contrast is that Peck wasn't the one cracking jokes or trying to prompt the audience to laugh. Because in terms of tone, his character was supposed to be at least moderately serious. Contrast the dubious government agency of the new, whose tone should have been entirely serious, but whose actions couldn't be further removed from the concept. I'd say that I would've had an easier time taking them seriously if they just started doing randomly choreographed dances out of nowhere, but...",0,0,2018-06-10T01:30:01.000Z,David Harder,UCNC7GJHlSTD6aZSkmu5AkRw,NO42eho8jQI,True,UgxRE5kMhlx8eQATwHt4AaABAg

"So how does one go about making Apu less offensive in a land composed off offensive characterizations without making Apu someone who doesn't fit the tone of the show?  

Honestly, I think it best that they just retire the character if it's such an issue.  Because making him ""less-offensive"" isn't really doable at this point.  The die was cast nearly 30 years ago.  Apu is Apu and always will be Apu.  

Or film his scenes live action, starring a well-dressed, completely integrated 2nd or 3rd generation Indian American and incorporate the live footage into the cartoon.  That'll teach 'em to bust their 'temater.

And how come no one cares to mention that Azaria also voices Carl and BumbleBee Man, two minorities that are even more under-represented in Springfield than Indians are?  

Is that also not problematic?  Shouldn't the Problem with Apu be The Problem with Hank Azaria, or the Problem with the Simpsons?

"Leia from the old trilogy was a far better character than Rey. Leia saved the rebellion by befriending the native people of Endor. She also resisted torture and stood up to Darth Vader. Leia was also the first character smart enough to figure out that the ""escape"" from the Deathstar was staged. Finally, rather than being ""won"" at the end by the male hero, Leia takes matters into her own hands and straightens out Han Solo who thought she was in love with Luke and was about to bow out.

In contrast, Rey is just a generic male-fantasy of a person who is instantly awesome of everything she tries including piloting a spacecraft, fighting with a lightsaber etc. because well... she's just that awesome. Worse, she solves all her problems with violence which makes her a grossly inferior character not only to Leia but to Luke as well who finally defeats the Emperor by throwing away his weapon and refusing to become like the violent men he opposed.

Rey is not a Mary Sue; she is  a gender-swapped Gary Stu and one of the worst in any mainstream fiction. She is basically written like the protagonist in a brainless Schwarzenegger movie from the 80s (not one of the good ones like Predator in which Arnold actually gets his ass kicked.)",0,1,2018-06-06T16:37:03.000Z,Camdenandroid,UChYcLSJU5osA_SFFeVatdpA,qf_rqde7B0A,True,UgyBUg97nPlbqOAFOPh4AaABAg

"I can explain why somewhat. It's actually a mixture of what works in both Bond and the Fast and Furious franchise, though it doesn't do as well as either in regard to the individual parts.

MI grew from a not terribly great Bond-esque action movie into the same thing but with an ever increasing and endearing cast of recurring characters.

It also happened to be released in the perfect time. Immediately after Goldeneye, which helped provide more interest in the spy/thriller genere, but prior to a series of lesser Bond films, providing the perfect environment for the sequels to flourish as an alternative for moviegoers to the diminishing returns for the Bond sequels up until Casino Royale in 2006. By that point, it had cemented itself well enough to stand out as its own thing.

In regard to the group dynamic, Cruise's Hunt is the odd one out. He doesn't have that chemistry or closeness with the rest of the crew. While they do help him out, they are usually functionally a separate plotline in the movies and provide that sense of thematic ""family"" that works in the Fast and Furious franchise, though to a lesser degree.

In a sense, you're getting some of what works in a Bond Movie mixed with elements of what makes a Fast and Furious movie work with this franchise, though they never quite mix perfectly well. The lions share of the plot follows Cruise's solo and detached ""Bond"" character in Hunt, where as Pegg, Rhames, and the rest of the recurring cast provide an interjection sprinkled throughout the films that provide a separate but endearing interaction and mesh together as a group.

These two nearly separate plotlines intertwine somewhat over the course of the films, but never quite mesh into a cohesive narrative or sense of ""we're in this together"" with Hunt's character. Instead they provide both the levity of the group interactions, as well as being a sort of audience surrogate that observes and makes commentary on Hunt's exploits.",0,0,2018-06-06T11:47:03.000Z,contrabardus,UC3j8eKsZlM42Grudw5LCS7g,E9sDZcpJYWQ,True,Ugy1CyxeI2g4CWvqKEN4AaABAg

"Holly fuck, I always thought that language is a prison for our minds, and your videos are proof of this, you talk waaaaaaay too much about things that can be said with less words and in a  more assertive way. A fun fact is that despite that languages have the goal to asign specific meanings to specific words we all asign subjective meanings to them, this means that even when 2 people speaking the same language say the exact same phrase, they can still mean different things, and I am not talking about synonyms.

In the intro to your video about ""transformers the animated movie"" you talk about how we can asign symbolism or meaning to anything despite the intention of the author. This is true, thats why we will never in the fucking world will find out what the ancient artists were thinking when they painted or wrote their work. there are also authors that deliberately keep interpretations open as they didn't think about anything when creating his piece other than creating expectation and interpretations from their audience. and some others make clear that his work piece is an actual paralelism to some particular situation. If we are smart enough we can conclude that we should not overanalize anything unless its the authors clear intention, in which case we would have acomplished the art piece goal; for the most part, art (including movies and videogames) only goal is to be contemplated. So, The matrix, its just a movie about a guy that is plugged to a machine that conducts electric pulses into his brain to make him believe he is free in a real world in order to maintain him alive, since this machine own power source are electric human pulses. Having found the true with his friend's help, he enters this fake world again to find out a way to end this human farming cycle. thats it, it doesn't matter what the brothers/sisters felt when they were writing the matrix script, the movie itself doesn't make any comparisson or relation to real events, everything is disclosed and specificaly said in the exposition dialogue, where analogies were used to explain the exact fucking plot without breaking the fourth wall or leaving anything to interpretation. If you make a draw of an apple and only you and other person  knows it means that dinner is in the fridge, the draw itself is still a fucking apple to anyone else or an overvalued computers brand. 

giving the matrix a transgender meaning is useless and stupid, since the movie can have the same analogy to a whole bunch of other topics/situations, and is even more stupid when the authors asigned this hidden meaning to it after they decided to cut off their dicks.

I know your intention is to entertain, but you need to speak just a bit slower and compensate that extra time spent with a more assertive but equally or even more entertaining script. That being said I think that your opinion should have been the matter in this video, rather than dumb loud subgroups agendas. Did you really think this movie was about getting through sexual confusion and finally embracing it with a sex change surgery? I mean, I thought the whole point of this videos were to comunicate your own thoughts on movies.

It is important to denote the difference between this video and the transformers animated movie video. The end goal of hasbro was to promote the new line of figures and you mentioned this fact but also recognized that the script itself wasn't an analogy of the hasbro factories ceasing production of the old toys and casting new molds but rather an independent story with no intention to make an analogy to this. The writters just did their work with the condition to kill certain characters to acomodate the manufacturers marketing goals, in any case hasbro might even ask the writers to do the exact oposite to an analogy, since consumers don't want to be fucked knowingly. In this video you mention that the actual script is an analogy to sexual confusion when it is clearly not, its just an external meaning third parties are trying to give to the movie. What I mean with this is that if the actual script intentions were to make an analogy with this condition, no one would have to explain it the entire fucking world, after all, the guy that draw the apple knew that the apple was a fucking apple and decided to give it a separate meaning just for his roomate. The little girl and the fucking bull are just that, despite the authors and stupid subgroups hidden meanings.",0,0,2018-06-05T08:49:36.000Z,Samir Gómez Novelo,UCxlwmXQF_fE_GpN6blgJBBw,LGopT-KNvlM,True,Ugw45gOIXSam5vVmNc54AaABAg

Nothing about it looked like something I just had to see, and I can wait to watch it on Netflix or Redbox. I can't say these spin off movies are something I felt like I needed to see. Just because you're a fan of Star Wars, doesn't mean you can't pick and choose what you see. I still have no desire watch the Holiday special.

It was a terrible script, a terrible plot, character “devolvement?” A few good scenes does not make a good movie. Trying to put Solo so close to a Star Wars film that was so divisive was destined to fail. Here’s the thing: Nobody now cares about episode 9. Know why? Because Lucasfilm doesn’t even know what it is yet! Unlike Infinity War which had very obvious lead ups and goals built up for years(and was totally awesome), TLJ failed to deliver and now nobody cares. It helps to have writers and directors that are all working towards the same goal from the get-go. Otherwise, you just might get a garbled piece of curiosity that leaves you feeling empty and not caring so much to see the next film.

"If your take is correct, it would actually explain a lot... By which I, of course, mean it would explain a lot about why these movies haven't been terribly well received by the fandom.

I'm sorry, but Star Wars fans didn't ask for a ""meta-narrative."" They didn't ask for freaking ""Gwenpool."" They asked for quality STAR WARS movies. That simply hasn't been delivered. 

I mean... Gheez. No wonder I so greatly preferred Rogue One and Solo to the two main trilogy films that have come out thus far. The former two actually focused on telling a decent STORY, in keeping with the principles of the established Star Wars universe, rather than being some pretentious hipster director's ""meta"" wankfest.

Hell! It actually seems like TFA and TLJ are actively focused on pretty much everything BUT trying to tell decent stories in the conventional sense. TFA was a giant load of meta-textual ""membaberry"" ghoulash which squandered what potential it had for genuinely interesting characters and concepts on over-the-top pandering and groan-worthy political messaging. TLJ not only doubled down on that, but also sacrificed narrative coherence in the name of pointless shock-jocking.

FYI, Rey being a stand-in for ""fangirls"" who obsess over every detail of Star Wars wouldn't make her any less of a ""Mary Sue."" It'd simply make her an ""audience stand-in"" Mary Sue. That's - quite frankly - actually worse than a self-insert. It's rather patronizing, and shows a certain lack of respect for one's audience (that, sadly, the hair brained Milennial 'true believers' in the new trilogy have kind of shown themselves to be undeserving of in the first place).

"While I certainly think that a large part of the reaction to Solo's box office is a bit overblown, I think you're underestimating the issue as well. The reason being that while the people you refer to are, as you say, only a fraction of the public, they do make up a larger part of the core fan base that would typically be expected to turn out for a movie like this. Should Solo have made Force Awakens or Last Jedi money? Of course not. The fact that they had to lower their own estimates so late in the game, and still only managed to meet those lowered expectations due to a 4 day weekend is telling. One movie does not provide enough data to make a real determination, however, we should at least consider the possibility that Last Jedi could have a Batman v Superman effect (though likely not as extreme) on the Star Wars franchise as it currently exists. Both are movies that made a profit off of fan loyalty, but left a bad taste in the mouths of many in the fan base.

As for Last Jedi itself, I respectfully disagree with you on that film. It bothered me, and not for any anti-SJW reasons. Truth be told, I'm a pretty liberal guy when it comes to most issues, and I'm rather tired of people going on SJW (dumb ass term) rants any time they don't like something. Speaking of which, why does Youtube keep recommending right wing reactionary videos to me when I keep telling them that I don't care for channels like that? You'd think that eventually the system would notice the common thread in all of the channels I say I don't care for. Truth is, a lot of popular Science Fiction is infused with liberal ideals. So, the message isn't really the issue. The deliver can be an issue, however, and L3 was a poor delivery system. Anyway, my issues with Last Jedi all come down to storytelling points. First of all, I don't give a damn about Laura Dern's hairdo. I do care that her character is a piss poor commanding officer. Sure, she has that bad ass sacrifice at the end, but everything leading up to it is a perfect example of how not to lead troops in combat. When you show no sign of changing a tactic that everyone has come to realize is doomed to failure, and you've given no one a reason to believe that you've got a plan to deal with the immediate threat in the works, should you be surprised when the crew mutinies? As for as the movie goes, the people trying to prevent what seems like certain disaster just should have known better and blindly followed the orders of someone who didn't appear to have a clue. Then there's the completely ludicrous idea of having Luke Skywalker get to the point that he's standing over the sleeping form of his teenage (young adult at least) nephew with an activate light saber about to strike before rethinking things. Seriously? The guy who wouldn't give up on Vader after all of the things he's done and all of the years he served the the Emperor is going to give up on his nephew (the son of his sister and best friend) that quickly? It simply makes no sense for the character. Can't say I was a big fan of the reveal that Rey's heavily teased ancestry turned out to be that she was no one of any importance. Sure, we've only had every other Star Wars movie ever made beat into our heads that this is a Skywalker story. Why not just abandon those themes and character developments out of nowhere in the 8th of what's supposed to be 9 movies. Oh, and while it's just an it only annoys me thing, that lady that was crushing on Finn is pretty much Jar Jar level annoying...also comes off as a bit stalkerish and refuses to take a hint. Well, that came off as more of an anti-Last Jedi rant than I intended it to be.",0,0,2018-06-05T03:02:38.000Z,stanklepoot,UCd0SvyMBrLHBoh5PhyMCo4w,jrusTEvgxgI,True,UgwXnqwwFuD4hYo470x4AaABAg

"First, this movie is tracking to lose 50 mill that is a bomb. Second, Han solo is like the Second or third most loved character of the OG Trilogy that is western culture Star war is deeply rooted in our culture it should be making billion. serious The first three character everyone thinks of is Luke, Han, Vader this not a small side character.  Thridlt, its the opening weekend with this marketing it should not have struggled to reach 115 Million The fact a star war movie might not make 500 Million is odd as shit. Fourthly, Last Jedi did not get anywhere near The force awaken if it was 2 or 3 hundred million I would think it nothing but, 700 Million that is a lot of people not showing up again. I think the last jedi turned mainstream people off of star wars a weird indie-esque was not the thing to do for the 2nd film, Empire strike back is far more solid film.I think Disney flooded the market with too much star wars and people are tired of it because they are all just fine okay films so people interest just slowly started going down 4 connected films it is like why should I care there will be a new star wars later.

"There's another element at play here other than the ""SJWs are killing Star Wars"" crowd. 
As Bob said, movies like this are keyed towards the kinds of fans who get really into the ""deep lore"" of Star Wars. Problem is, when Disney decided to reboot the original continuity and render the expanded universe non-canon, they alienated almost all of that demographic. Sure, the new continuity has some hardcore fans, but the ""deep lore"" of the Star Wars rebooted canon doesn't go very deep. It's only four years old, as opposed to the 40 years that the Legends continuity was around, gathering a loyal following and keeping the most hard-core fans constantly engaged with Star Wars' offerings.
This movie basically has no target audience. The people who cared the most about Han Solo's origins already had books that tell that story, which this movie ignores. Not only that, but in this new canon, the character of Han Solo isn't even that important in the grander scheme of things. We see how he ends up: a deadbeat dad who runs from his problems and dies pointlessly at the hands of the son he failed. Why would we care about the beginning of a character's story when we know it ends in failure and disgrace?
Contrast to the original EU, where Han stepped it up and became a true hero, serving the people of the New Republic and fighting for what was right even when his son turned to the dark side in that continuity too. That version of Han had a proper arc; from urchin, to criminal, to scoundrel, to soldier, to hero. That was a character people could get excited about.

A sci-fi film initially envisioned as a sorta heist movie with a troubled production involving a change in directors, released oddly soon after a more prominent tentpole in the same franchise and a week after another major studio tentpole underperforms in the box-office? Possibly being attributed to fatigue with regards to the franchise as a whole, but could also be pointed to marketing that gives the film a feeling that it's more like the franchise's normal flair, plus a lot of people really wanting to see the original director(s)'s version?

"I am a star wars fan who had to be dragged to this movie. I could smell what it was going to be, and I was right. I do not like having any piece of media dangling fandom factoids in front of my face like someone entertaining a baby with their keys. Also, having so very many of Solo's things happen in the space of a single event (the few days of the movie in-universe) cheapened what a lot of those things meant. 
For example, winning the ship, meeting chewy, doing the kessle run and then gaining his cynicism sounded like a full lifetime of events, that would have been just the highlights among years of other smaller events, giving solo time to become who he is.

"Oooh, sick burn on Jeremy Jahns!    Thank you Bob, for offering a reasonable, well-thought out perspective to the increasingly hysterical Disney Star Wars hate currently congesting net culture.    I myself enjoyed ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" more than I thought I would, but still thought it was somewhat unnecessary and the endless spin-off films run the risk of diluting the Star Wars universe.    That being said,  the type of hyperbolic hate being spewed by incel alt-right man-children like Sargon of Akkad,  MundaneMatt and their 4Chan-dwelling ilk blaming the box-office slump of the new films on some imaginary ""SJW conspiracy"" is really getting out of hand; and poisoning the discourse on these movies.    And unfortunately,  the opinions of a bunch of racist, misogynist, homophobic white fanboys is being the loudest one voiced, with their review-bombing of RottenTomatoes scores.   In the words of James Hetfield, ""They say the empty can rattles the most"".   If you don't like the new Star Wars films, fine; that's your opinion.   But if you hate them because of the prescence of women and minorities;  it's time to re-evaluate why you were attracted to a saga centering around leftist militants seeking to overthrow an oppressive human (read: WHITE) supremacist dictatorship in the first place.",0,0,2018-06-04T17:38:53.000Z,DoctorPretorious616,UCJjQ1Lg1G-JlMe1wOvfJPMQ,jrusTEvgxgI,True,UgwdGBM4LfvW5ZItr7Z4AaABAg

"While you are entirely correct that Solo's lack of success at the box office isnt the GIANT thing that some YouTubers are pretending it is, and that super nerds (like myself and many others who adore Star Wars) ""boycotting"" the movie due to this and that isn't going to affect the film's earnings all that much, and it's more about the general audience having a lack of interest in a prequel/origin movie about a character we all like but is played by a new and generally unknown actor, there is more to the story than that.

I'd put most of the blame of Solo's failures due to the bad reception of Episode VIII, the release date, and ALL of the behind the scenes problems the movie has had over the last few months. It's not just anti-SJW, purple-hair-hating people who disliked The Last Jedi. It is a flawed film with many issues that turned off a LOT of people, so any movie that comes after that one is gonna have people a little wary. Releasing it in between Infinity War and Deadpool 2 was one of the stupidest decisions I've seen in a long time. If it came out around Xmas, like Rogue One did, I'll bet it would have done WAY better; One: because the lack of any sort of ""Star Wars fatigue, two: because there would have been a lot more time to forget the bad taste that TLJ left in our mouths a full year earlier, and three: it probably would have been the biggest movie at the box office at the time. AND maybe it would have given them more time to fix and improve the film instead of RUSHING it into theaters for Memorial Day, maybe? Oh, and I'll bet quite a few people over the last few months to a year or so have heard of the massive troubles in the making of Solo, so that lost a lot of people's confidence in it being an actual good movie (even if the final result wasn't THAT affected by the problems in the end)

It does kinda suck that everything happened like this, because I'll bet Solo is a decent, fun little film that WAY more people would go see and enjoy under different circumstances. Its lack of success has come about due to a lot more factors than simply the quality of the movie itself. Also, I'd HIGHLY bet that if the release dates of TLJ and Solo were swapped, Solo would have done MUCH better as the first new SW movie in a year, plus it could have been a nice build-up to TLJ rather than the stink of TLJ ultimately ruining some of the potential of Solo. At least those are my two cents.",0,0,2018-06-04T17:35:48.000Z,HeroicPunk,UCD_BYlP1HMAsCDlvV6MoZqg,jrusTEvgxgI,True,UgzYHR6hUHxGzRw9wHl4AaABAg

"From the very beginning, this video seems entirely disingenuous by Bob.  This video is not about Solo's under-performance, its about how its performance can not and should not be tied to the radical anti-SJW fanboys who hated TLJ and Rey in TFA, and in the process, Bob distorts the facts to suit his own narrative.

The movie is a bomb, at this point its factually accurate.  The movie was predicted initially to open at 105-112 for the 3-day weekend and 130-136 million for the 4-day weekend, according to Boxofficemojo.  It opened at 84/103, 25-30 million below expectations, and 55% below the other non-main title Star Wars movie in Rogue One.  And it dropped 66% in its second week against no competition.  Ignoring how ballooned the costs for the movie were due to the behind the scenes turmoil and reshoots, the movie performing so badly compared to its predecessors, and even then compared to its predictions, is a real story, and Bob brushes it off as if it should be expected the movie would open so much worse in the first 2 minutes of the video.  That, to me, feels like Bob is brushing off the poor opening as not being poor so as to provide zero ammo for the radical fanbase and videos he despises, mostly justifiably so.

Bob's analysis for its lack of performance is that the movie was aimed at a niche fanboy audience, and that because said fanboy audience is so small compared to the large scope, that the movie was going to perform as it did.  And, because the niche part of the niche fanboy audience that hates Kathleen Kennedy and SJW with a passion is so small, that their boycott has no impact on the movie's performance, which didn't bomb anyways.  Which, would be a fine point, if it wasn't for Rogue One's insane performance being a similarly niche movie about a story no one ever cared about in why did the Death Star have a design flaw.  And FWIW, having seen the movie, it has a ton of fanservice in it, but it never felt like a movie about the fanservice and it wasn't a movie I enjoyed because of the fanservice.

To me, there are a ton of valid reasons Solo underperformed, and rather than Bob explain why it did in his opinion, he crafted an argument about why it wasn't because of the boycott of the more toxic fanboys, while at the same time ignoring that the decidedly mixed reaction to TLJ, which extends well beyond the toxic fanboys.  TLJ was an unquestionably flawed movie even when you look past the anti-SJW trolls, but Bob does not seem to acknowledge the flaws/criticism as having validity.  It feels to me that Bob's galvanized so much against this part of the fanbase that he's ignoring the fact that the movie underperformed heavily so they can have nothing to hang their hats on, and it colors the entire video as a disingenuous take on Solo's box-office performance.",15,6,2018-06-04T17:34:06.000Z,Tarrot,UC_b_XaYRS3YV2CCtFsDF2ZA,jrusTEvgxgI,True,Ugxx31IuFXMuD7dgB5l4AaABAg
"I like moviebob. I liked TLJ & TFA well enough and didn’t like R1. But solo opened far lower than any MCU movie since 2011, and calling it anything other than a huge financial disappointment is bizarre rationalization. 

Star Wars brand was stronger than MCU brand a year ago. 

Be honest: if somebody had asked you last year what the FLOOR is for a Star Wars labeled mainstream movie to open at, it would have been a number north of $100 million. Solo opened below Dr Strange and Antman, which had almost zero going for them to make big money, other than the MCU brand.

For whatever reason, the Star Wars brand took a big hit this year. This is less than Justin League money. I know you hate the boycotting Star Wars fanboys (I don’t like them either) but in this case, they are right about the Star Wars brand being tarnished badly.",0,0,2018-06-04T17:29:52.000Z,Dukjin Im,UCJeYILSBoeemYi25Eil_YZQ,jrusTEvgxgI,True,UgwKhIC1AWEaiMpBL014AaABAg

"I wonder if this affects their plans for future solo movies. Like they've been announcing all these spin-offs like Boba Fett, Lando, and Obi-Wan assuming that general audiences would be as interested in the backstories of these characters as the fanboys are, but that's evidently not the case. The ending to Solo also suggests to me that they may have had bigger plans to tie them all together with the Crimson Dawn stuff. I doubt Solo underperforming will mean canceling those, but they surely won't approach them the way they did Solo. Making them with more reasonable budgets is an obvious first step, but I also wonder if they might look at why Rogue One was so much more successful than Solo. Rogue One didn't pitch itself as the movie about the rebels who got the Death Star plans, it pitched itself as a war film that took place in the era of the original trilogy. Whereas Solo pitched itself as backstory to a character most people didn't feel they needed backstory for, who is no longer being played by the actor who made them like the character in the first place.

So I wonder if they still do the Boba Fett and Lando and Obi-Wan movies, but instead of calling them FETT and LANDO and KENOBI, they give them more general titles like Rogue One and market them in a way that suggests they're not just a backstory movies for one character.",0,1,2018-06-04T17:21:38.000Z,Kevin Stevens,UCTcmzyMMyTq7LyobYSZWk1w,jrusTEvgxgI,True,UgxrXtYH8mj6nYODtLh4AaABAg

"I honestly have not bothered with the spin-off movies in this franchise, and I may stop caring about Star Wars altogether if this keeps up.  
My problems with Force Awakens were that nothing about it stuck in my memory and I feel no compulsion to see it again.
My problems with Last Jedi are that, while I rate it higher than Force Awakens by virtue of it actually having shit I remember, including things I remember positively, the movie as a whole felt unpolished, which I personally blame on the speedy release schedule not giving the director and screenwriter enough time to polish it.  All the pieces were there for a good movie, but it wasn't given time to work out the kinks.
And if Disney is going to continue this schedule of one movie a year, then I'm just going to wash my hands of it because very few people could ever produce great works of film under those time constraints.  There is a reason why films take YEARS to make.  The original trilogy was from 1977 to . . . . 1989, wasn't it?  That's more than ten years.  Because the film-makers took time to polish the films and they took down time between when one film ended and the next began to analyze the previous film and work out what was good and what could be improved upon.  Without that time, you can never make a movie that's better than okay and Disney does not want to give that time because they want the movies right now.

"Hey Bob, I doubt you will read this, but wanted to say something anyway. 

I usually buy 4 tickets to see a blockbuster like this, for me and the family. I was disappointed in TLJ, but was more disappointed in the comments from the creators who said (almost completely outright) that if I did not like TLJ it was because I was anti-feminist, or racists, or anti-lgbt, etc... Not once did I hear ""yes, we can see how some aspects of the story could make the fanbase upset, and we are sorry for that, but..."" or ""no, the story did not quite flow as smoothly as it should have, but that is a risk we took in the movie..."" There was no accountability, no admittance of doing anything wrong, only name-calling. And that is what completely turned of me and a good majority of people I know. 

So I did not buy 4 tickets (maybe 8 if the movie was good and we wanted to see it again) and I know a few other people and families that did not either, for the same reason. So call it a boycott or otherwise, but TLJ was disappointing to a lot of fans, and the response fro the creators was pretty bad (IMHO).

"I get your point here but I think you're underselling how hard Solo flopped. It wasn't crazy nerds that set high expectations for it. Everyone did, including industry experts. And even Disney itself, considering the budget.

Scott Pilgrim is a poor comparison. It was niche, and mostly unheard of, and cost 85 million to make.

Solo is a spin-off but it's still a character and franchise that everyone has heard of, that had a built in audience far larger than pilgrim did. 

Same goes for Ant-Man. It wasn't considered a failure when it didn't match the Avengers' gross because it was an unknown property and cost far less to make. 

Solo reportedly had a production budget of 250 million, almost twice as much as Ant-man and 4 times that of Scott Pilgrim.

Nobody expected it to gross 1.2 billion like Last Jedi, but most projections had it in the 700-1000 million range. Now it looks like it might struggle to hit 500. It won't recuperate its budget from its box-office gross. That's a failure.

I think trying to act like we were wrong to predict Solo that high and thus it isn't a flop isn't objective. It underperformed and Star Wars isn't bulletproof. I think there's more interesting analysis to be done to figure out why and how the unstoppable juggernaut has suddenly been slowed down significantly, and we won't get that if we just try to convince ourselves that it wasn't a flop.",5,0,2018-06-04T16:36:17.000Z,WhateverReally,UCRRVBwt3iFCYUaDYHKAzw_Q,jrusTEvgxgI,True,UgzhkM589Kx7YlurBUV4AaABAg

"Lucasfilm should (and I believe they do) view these ""Story"" films as building content for the Disney streaming service. So, when general audiences are ready to bing ""Star Wars."" There will be ton of content with different stories and feel. 

My (very uninformed) guess would be; Kennedy got permission to blow this budget out to a level Disney knew would be hard to make a ton of money off. She earned this right from Disney by making INSANE amounts of money with here first 3 SW films. 

I think they should keep with the plan they have. Make IX, Boba Fett (AKA, underworld 2), Kenobi, Weiss and Benioff films, Johnson trilogy, and Favreau tv show.  Right now, I think what is messing with people (more than anything is) SW films are no longer rare/special, events. It will take a little while to see what the full ramifications of that is.

"I love how you dismissed all legitimate critique about The Last Jedi by citing a non-legitimate criticism. The straw man fallacy- I mean- the force is strong with you.~ To refute your twisted conclusion: It didn't help that The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi character-assassinated the male protagonists of the original series. The movie audience might be dumb, but they knew not to get invested in a character, who ultimately became a dead-beat dad and who left his family to relive his past life as a smuggler. Han Solo was utterly wasted in the new trilogy, so why should ticket buyers make an effort to see his stand-alone movie? Lucasfilms was so busy destroying the series' older male characters, yet they were surprised to see the expensive backstory of one of said legacy character not do so well. Even animals know not to shit where they eat. Trust me, episode 9 isn't going to do better. After what they did to Luke, the protagonist of the original series, what makes Rey any safer from a character annihilation other than her double X chromosomes? Why should we get invested at all given Lucasfilms' track record of doing wrong by their older characters to introduce new blood? Rey could easily be destroyed to make way for a new homosexual mix Latin and African girl who is even stronger in the force. You can see why this system of revolving-door heroism don't work right?

"I agree with the fans aren't that big. But disagree with how they made Solo. Solo felt like a movie made that felt like using Traditional Hollywood Episodic Popcorn Blockbuster Franchise format. (I was entertain by the film but didn't feel like it was a great Star War film.) Take a popular character and just give them a spinoff movie/tv show before figuring out a story reason for them. (Minions, Finding Dory, Xena Warrior Princess, Joey, Frasier, etc was created with this format.) Some succeed, some failed. 

Like how the Solo got his name felt very simple. (felt very Hollywood blockbuster writer solution) Compare how Hodor(Game of Thrones) name story is done. Where is the depth? They need someone who is a deeper writer for those type of situations. 

None of their new films felt like long term story arc storytelling films. Writing a story that is 10 hours long is different than writing a story that is under 3 hours. Before Netflix(or streaming era), most of Hollywood only know how to make episodic one off stories. (Look at how Home Alone 2 was made) Most of Hollywood were discourage to write long term story arc stories until this era. (Look at how the writers from Star Trek Deep Space Nine were treated.) Something like One Piece(800+ episode) with a continuous story that is broken up into arcs would have never been made here. There is a reason why there is only one MCU in Hollywood. 

Do we really need to see Rouge One and Solo to get the bigger story arc for Episode films? Marvel work because it is the solo films building up to a giant event film. DCEU should use this format but it rush the format too much. The new Star Wars doesn't even try to use this format. They didn't make all their films matter or influence the episode films. 

Kathleen Kennedy is a very good one off movie maker but Star War property is not that. It is a long term story arc and lore based franchise. ) Those required someone that is a master world builder and lore builder like a George R Martin(Game of Thrones), J RR Tolkien(Lord of Rings), Eiichiro Oda(One Piece), etc to run it. She learned most of her skills from Spielberg instead of Lucas. Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest director in Hollywood but struggle to make Transformers franchise respectable. Why is Transformers a brain dead action franchise? How come his sci fi movie background didn't help him with Transformers? I would not trusted him overseeing any lore base properties like Game of Thrones, Lord of Rings, One Piece, Marvel, etc. I don't think they respect fictional lore stuff as much as non-fiction stuff(WWII). 

This isn't the first time a Hollywood producer misunderstood a property or just don't understand the source material or don't appeal to them. Death Note(they gave a horror director for a psychological thriller), Ghost in the Shell(they gave a discounted Zack Synder for a psychological thriller), Deadpool(it took two version before they went to the source material), etc. Sometimes in Hollywood when they don't understand something, they change the appeal part so THEY can understand it. Her appeal changes have divide fans.

A lot of her approach feels like any Typical Episodic Hollywood Popcorn Blockbuster franchise format. (If these films were not called Star Wars, this franchise would be fine. Her films are decent if you remove the brand.)",0,0,2018-06-04T15:53:20.000Z,Sherwin Lui,UC-cH0wvITb3aS4VEoEa5bmw,jrusTEvgxgI,True,Ugx9PsQE3B3pYZOQBxV4AaABAg

"I'm calling BS on this one, Bob! IT sounds more to me that you're beholden to the studios.

There's no denying that this movie looked and felt like two completely different movies slapped together. That has everything to do with the fact that Ron Howard took over from Phil Lord and Chris Miller, after they'd already completed most of the filming; and they had completely different styles. It's a movie with a personality disorder! It doesn't know whether to be a movie that drags you through with a story, or pulls you along with action; and ne'er the twain did meet!

Look! We know, Bob. You can't slag movies in the same manner that got you to where you are, because if you do... you'll get dropped from Geek.com and lord knows what else you happen to work on. We get it.

I won't thumbscrew you on this. Just saying... Solo could have been a LOT better; and it fell short, because they didn't stick with the original format. Had they gone with Lord and Miller... sure, you'd have a lot of tired (but fit) actors...  from having to do 30 takes of the same scene, all the time... but the end product would have been so much better.

This isn't to slag Ron Howard. He's a proven director; and maybe Solo would have been great, had he been the director from day one. Who knows?

"Alright Bob the reason why so many people hate The Last Jedi is simply because of how they handled Luke

Luke Skywalker was a character that didn't give up even when he had been utterly outclassed defeated and had his hand chopped off. he was an optimist to the point where he was capable of seeing the sliver of good left Within Darth Vader. throwing away the lightsaber he had constructed to replace the one he lost so that he could be no longer tempted to end his father's life or give in to hatred symbolizing becoming a true Jedi. While knowing that this would most likely result in his death at the emperor's hands. he risked his life and the success of the Rebellion in order to give that sliver of good a chance to persevere and to bring his father back from the Dark Side. something he was told could not be done by every Mentor that taught him about the force.

In The Last Jedi they took that Luke Skywalker and had him attempt to murder his own nephew, In Cold Blood, while he slept. just because he sensed some dark within him? that's the polar opposite of his character.

That lightsaber belonged to his father before he turned to the dark side. it was the lightsaber given to him by Obi One Kenobi. the one he trained and learned the ways of the force with. it was an heirloom. it should have had immense sentimental value to him being the only physical item left to him from his late father and mentor. The last time he held it in his hands he had two hands. And he threw it away within a couple of seconds of being reunited with it like it was a piece of garbage.

It would be like watching a serious Superman movie where he acted like Hancock with the same motivations he did in the Injustice universe or red sun",2,2,2018-06-04T15:35:43.000Z,ShadowMatter,UCum7R7DS9smgbvcDAf6FQAw,jrusTEvgxgI,True,Ugx5zmzzAYsyOv5JYwx4AaABAg

"Sorry Bob but you're kind of wrong on this one, and it's obvious when you yourself say that this was only going to appeal to the hardcore fans, and then say that a boycott of hardcore fans from this films doesn't have an effect on this at the box office.
You would have also had a point if Rogue One didn't exist, a spin-off side story with unknown characters and no major actors in the role, and yet that film did well at the box office, which shows that when Star Wars fans show up for these things they can still do well even if they aren't films aimed at the mainstream audience.
You would have also had a point if you weren't ignoring the painfully bad audience score for The Last Jedi on Rotten Tomatoes, and if you didn't do videos about Batman Vs Superman and how it would translate to Justice League.

Solo failed at the box office for three reasons: 
1, It's an average film, and that is on Kathleen Kennedy, she chose the directors and the writers, we know that Ron Howard generally shoots a film as it's written, after all that's why he was hired in this case because the writers (the Kasdan's') weren't happy that Lord & Miller were changing things constantly. So from that we can say that the story was average as it was written and she probably backed the wrong horse.
2, Timing, they brought the release forward from it's Christmas release, you still have Avengers being shown, and you had Deadpool 2, so are you going to watch an average film? Or a good film?
3, The boycott, sorry Bob but it's true, when you have the above factors and the only hope of breaking even is that your fanbase will mobilise and show up and watch this film again and again, then having a chunk of these fans refuse to show up will hurt you",2,1,2018-06-04T14:20:17.000Z,mrfried,UCHacyWx0oqZ90IYFa-26J5g,jrusTEvgxgI,True,Ugwe7tRmXoD1U88n87V4AaABAg

Last Jedi would have been a great film if it had cut everything except the Rey, Luke, Ren stuff out and properly fleshed that stuff out into the character driven story it should have been.

"""Laura Dern's haircut, I think?"" Look Bob... You don't have to agree with HALF of the audience on The Last Jedi.

It comes off as disrespectful and completely undermining the Star Wars fans that aren't digging the 'Disney era' of the franchise. Even though I enjoyed Rogue One (as a prologue).

"No thumb. I get it you liked a TLJ but honestly yes this is a film that lost money. And the story here is that no one in the nerd culture as you call it was saying or acting like they should save it. It is a story because they DID los money on Star Wars. That they may one day break even tells you how big a fail this is. And most importantly,  no one expected this to make a lot less money the Rogue One! That is the bench mark. I don’t know many fans that wanted this and they did it anyway. That is a misstep and thus a story. 

PS - TLJ sucks and clearly failed in multiple STORYTELLING ways. My elderly mom is a grandmother and she watches it once and was completely in impressed which is a first.

"Why even make such a pointless episode related to box office? Disney making money or not is something I really don't care about. 
All the matters to me is if the movie is good or not.

edit:
This came off more egocentric than I meant it, because this applies to the audience as a whole as well. TFA doing well at the box office won't change my opinion that the movie had been rather boring. Neither will it change anyone's else opinion on the movie, no matter if they loved or hated it. Same for Solo, TLJ, RO, etc 

The only thing when box office success matters is in cases like the golden compass, when the movie was a huge flop on a 180 million dollar budget and 400 million international, but the studio sold the international rights for cheap and did only get like 50 million back on domestic sales. So no complete trilogy for that series. The american christian boycott actually worked, because the studio screwed up their business plan. 

But on a huge franchise like star wars? A flop only means that they need to do better the next time and maybe increase marketing budget. Now they might be more careful with their directors next time, because apparently the risk did not pay off this time and making the movie a lot more expensive. I am not sure if Disney was cutting a lot of the usual marketing budget for that reason as well or if they maybe did just use this movie as a test bed to see how well the movie would sell on the just the brand itself.",0,0,2018-06-04T12:39:25.000Z,Traumglanz,UCscxopqd6af2ZC0X47hstxg,jrusTEvgxgI,True,Ugy7nesI87BmFADPJ114AaABAg

"(Not having seen it, I can't speak to Solo's actual content), but I think I can speak to my general ennui of the franchise that's been growing since about Rogue One.  Bob's take on this seems more counter-reactionary than particularly insightful, and that's not something I say lightly as a genuine fan of his that sees where he's coming from with the Last Jedi stuff even if I'm not 100% there myself.

He's right that the ""SJW screaming internet assholes"" aren't the real story here, but devoting that much time to them still makes them disproportionately part of the Solo box office conversation.  Star Wars internet culture is a topic in itself, and how to extricate every goddamn comment about franchise from those assholes is a pressing need.  But, like Bob correctly says, I don't think it had much to do any box office slump, so why are we talking about it in that context?

Secondly, the ""pro-Last Jedi"" corner of my own personal circle of obsessed internet-myopic-fanboys have been selling this idea that Disney's success comes from avoiding the deep-cut fan references in favor of taking the franchise in a new and fresh direction with open irreverence to the kind of fanservice that dominates the old Expanded Universe.  That fanservice seems to be exactly what Solo is, but (like Rogue One), I don't understand why I, as a super-invested Expanded Universe fan, get essentially nothing out of it.

So, I'm left in this really unsatisfying middle-ground.  The more casual nerd-hostile fans want a Star Wars that grows out of the Original Trilogy mold into something that (I think) loses the unique spark of space fantasy that the OT had, while the old school fans feel that new thing is missing that spark, but instead of having that conversation, the louder alt-right opportunists are jumping in like parasitic leeches to claim that dissatisfaction as part of their toxic agenda, and then the people I like and listen to would much rather fight that battle because it's one that has a clearly delineated right and wrong, instead of actually digging into what makes Star Wars special and how Kennedy may not have a firm handle on that.

While obviously miles ahead of the DCEU, I think Disney's Lucasfilm's problems are similarly a *series* of problems, often with overcorrections and tangents that distract from what should be the core of their business.  They're circling the bullseye and (with the exception of Force Awakens which I think got mostly the right balance of fanservice to fresh soil) it's been further and further off the mark.",1,0,2018-06-04T12:26:02.000Z,dorsk188,UCij8PRTpwTKYrM5b-JNqt_A,jrusTEvgxgI,True,UgwpG7BhkdtA61TW2st4AaABAg

Also, back in the 90's, the fandom resurrected Star Wars by showing such massive support for a series of novels that it spawned a revival of the franchise so intense It inspired Lucas to go ahead and write new scripts for the prequel trilogy.  Or, most recently, another fandom inspired WB to resurrect Young Justice as a Netflix series.  Don't underestimate the impact of widespread fan support, or the lack of it.

Is it true that Solo looks like  mediocre movie, that was never going to pull in big bucks anyway? - Yes
Is it doing OK anyway?  - No, it may not break even domestically, and that will be a first for a SW movie.
Does no one care about the interstitial SW movies? - No Rogue One made a billion.
Was Last Jedi a much better movie, that was only hated by sexists who didn't like purple hair? 
- No it was putrid and lost a lot of fans.
Does all of this mean that crazies on the internet have had a successful boycott? - Doubtful, but to pretend that Disney don't care and haven't noticed, is ridiculous.  Movies work on word of mouth, and if the word of mouth is 
"" that last movie was so terrible I'm boycotting the next one "", that's not ideal.   
Youtube is no biggie either, but remember it was youtube that tore Phantom Menace a new orifice.
Hardcore fans are a very small percentage of the overall box office, but they are opinion leaders.
The fans are the ones who help generate buzz and drag other people in.
The fan narrative is still important, and don't kid yourself that the execs aren't watching. 

Last Jedi made money, Solo didn't.
Batman V Superman made money, Justice League didn't.

"A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away... there were those who claimed every single non 100% reaffirmation of white people was ""White Genocide"". Then the great Disney Empire came along and in an effort to appeal to the masses began systematically killing off the ""White Genocide"" crowd. Many tried to alert the masses to the evil doings of the Great Disney Empire, who were finally making their play to take over the world. 

However the ""White Genocide"" crowd had been raging at nothing for so long, when someone actually did start killing them off, no one believed them or cared about them and their eradication was a breath of fresh air for the galaxy at-large. Thus began the rise of our glorious Disney overlords. Today there is a Rebellion that resist the pull of Disney.

"Although these are mostly valid points - Yes, of course a small set of pissy fanboys promising a boycott isn't going to have the box office clout to effect anything (otherwise The Last Jedi wouldn't have been such a blockbuster success). And, yes, there's no way anyone should expect a niche fanservice driven spin-off prequel to make anywhere near the money that Force Awakens and Last Jedi did. And, OK, you can even say that Solo will eventually turn an alright profit so it isn't the biggest flop of all time (remember how the animated Clone Wars movie dropped to just $5 million on its second week of release?) - but Solo's failure at the box office is still surprising and can't simply be explained by those observations.

Rogue One was also a niche prequel explaining backstories in bits of Star Wars lore that probably only hardcore fans needed filling in, also a well publicised troubled production with massive reshoots, and also a largely good enough but not amazing product, and yet was a pretty big box office hit, especially compared to Solo.

There's probably a lot more factors to Solo's failure than ""no matter how much nerd culture has become mainstream, only super nerds actually care about detailed Star Wars lore."" I think this video touches briefly on a far more plausible explanation: blockbuster oversaturation. It's only a few months since the last Star Wars and Infinity War, Deadpool etc. are still out.

Most of the people that actually cared about how Han met Chewy or how Sabacc was played have had decades of expanded universe material that answered those questions. And while it's true that some of those answers were technically removed from canon, it doesn't change the fact that we'd had that knowledge so that itch was scratched. In some cases, the fact that they were retconning ""known"" information may have even further hampered desire to see it.

"If this movie happened today where they killed off and changed the whole cast of characters like this, there would be social media outrage from all the whiney fan-babies. #notmytransformers
It's amazing to see adults in all of nerdom have fucking conniption fits over any type of alteration to their favorite IP's.
I mean, I don't enjoy all the whack changes done to some of the things I like, but I don't lose my shit like a toddler, and cry that my childhood's been ruined. Hell even as kid it didn't ruin my childhood. Sometimes the change works, sometimes it doesn't.
I remember when this movie came out. As a huge Transformers fan, I loved it. And honestly after the movie, the Transformers IP became lame, because the new toys sucked. Same with GiJoe. But I just quit buying the toys and reading the comics.
It was pretty easy. I moved on to other things. It certainly didn't ruin my childhood.
And yet now, so many ADULTS in soo many fandoms cry and whine about every single little thing that's changed as if it's the most important thing in the world. As though it's sacrilegious to alter these properties that they don't own anyway. If it doesn't work or you don't like the change, let the creators know if able, then stop buying or supporting the product. And then? Move on! But now it's all about tearing down everything and starting vocal social media outrage to whip up fury and hatred, which gets directed by, to, and from the fans, creators, and employees alike. Sadly it comes off as entitled fan-babies who have too much time on their hands, that have the privilege to spend time engaging in and/or creating fantasy entertainment. The ""We don't get to have nice things"" meme is fucking pathetic. There is literally millions of, shows, movies, cartoons, books,comics, games etc to choose from, all of which have countless varieties of quality and subject matter within.

"dude...at 26 25 when you summarize the ""there is no spoon bit"" that really took me back, I still get chills thinking of that.
not about physically changing objects, no, but about a lot of conformist behavior that you seemingly HAVE to obey or (cue exaggerated scary voice) ""bad things will happen.""

Which is of course, a combination of 
not at all true, 
not nearly as bad as everyone implies, and
""people haven't actually experienced this, they have just heard, so they unthinkingly conform and spread the ""conform or you will get punished"" message even though, well, see above.

even when they DO ""exhile"" you, it doesn't hurt all that much, and most of them don't have any idea what they are talking about, they are simply conformists repeating a lie.

which REMINDS me of a VERY different (yet tangentially related) context.

They (corporations in this case, and by extension, all the conformists who allow their beliefs to be determined by corporations and by everyone else and by conformity) unthinkingly just go along, even though almost none of them have really tested if the the messages they are being told and spreading themselves have ANY truth (which frankly they usually don't, but as I was saying:)

So often you hear ""lowest prices of the season"", or get the idea that 10 percent, 15 percent, or 25 percent off clothes are a GOOD deal.

HOGWASH.  

the LOWEST prices are 90, 95 percent off.   and prices that low DO happen, at the RIGHT times of year, even at (especially, one might say) stores like Macy's.   it doesn't happen when THEY SAY it does, but it DOES happen, and these prices ""ARE"" the lowest. 

I have seen nice sport coats, for 178 dollars, marked down to 14.99, no joke.

that's around 90 percent off.

but they don't advertise this, they advertise, well, see, above, their usual conformist ""black friday"" type things.  

it serves THEM, the system, not anyone or anything else.

all the conformists simply don't question it enough, and just follow suit.

blah blah.  

moral?
don't believe ""the system,"" any system.  It has itself in mind, not you.

"Thank you Bob, this is the best defence of the film I've seen even though I still hate it. I agree that Luke's return was the best thing about TLJ, but I feel that the meta-narrative in the film isn't coherent. This is connected to how the Mary Sue charge is absolutely valid. It seems absurd for Rey, a fan, to be able to become the giant she/the franchise is metaphorically standing on in the fictional timeline because she hasn't earned it yet- just because you grew up in an ultra-militaristic environment surrounded by stories of war heroes does not mean you can lead a war front (e.g soloing a whole squad of imperial guards with a half assed contribution from Ben). The effect is that Rey is an IMITATION of the audience, a caricature of near perfection trying to be ""just like us"" because she just happened to be born out of nowhere; thereby it's insulting rather than celebratory. 
It's also quite clear that Luke was absolutely right in his analysis of the Jedi order- the wheels of the old Jedi/Sith morality would eventually drive a new fascist tyranny that we see in the First Order (something which Luke gave into by trying to kill Ben and thus creating the modern trilogy's new villain). So he definitely has a point and it's not just a grey area- so the ending becomes so incoherent when Solo is punished for essentially agreeing with Luke, and Yoda's ghost confirming the point by burning the Jedi text. The books being stolen at end by Rey now appears like she (and Rian) is saying fuck off to all these characters and the old status quo that they themselves want to evolve by... Maintaining the wheel herself through keeping the texts?! I don't know if we should keep the old ways because it's bad, or burn and build a new one, or improve upon the mistakes of the old and keep it because of how symbolically contradicting it is. The fact that it is revealed at the end that Rey keeps the texts mean that it is separated from Yoda's symbolic through simple screen time, befuddling the whole thematic story.
This is on top of the rest of the batshit writing problems, becoming basically propaganda which you hint at (Disney's capitalist hypocrisy), that riddles the supporting plot on a technical and thematic level; I would love to like the film, but the writing choices make it so hard to do so. I'm not even a Star Wars fan, so maybe it doesn't connect as much, but still damn this movie infuriated me.",0,0,2018-06-01T20:57:16.000Z,Des Morga,UC5Lb7LgPklYWCap-l3KYQog,qf_rqde7B0A,True,Ugwu-ip8nwWm5XV2hDh4AaABAg

"You know here's the thing. This new Thundercats is very obviously going for something different. And well ok but keep in mind one of the big demographics of this sort of nostalgic reboot is older audiences less so than kids. Not that kids won't watch it or even original fans of Thundercats with kids won't watch it with them, but in making it so dramatically different you're closing off that potential audience. Which brings up the point of how much you can change something before it not only ceases to be that thing altogether. For example the ReBoot well...reboot. Not only was that so different but its making and premise were so far removed from ReBoot that even the people making it wondered why to even bother calling it ReBoot. It didn't help that it was also poorly acted, lazily made, and flatter than a cardboard cutout. I guess my point is yeah let kids have their silly Thundercats Teen Titans Go style cartoon but in that same vein as an entertainment company don't expect fans to like it and then wonder in amazement why the nostalgia numbers don't pour in.",0,0,2018-06-01T04:58:19.000Z,Xecryo,UCghL-IUgWh_aYo4Ii6ChzpA,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,Ugx5_IT71UkaED9YD2B4AaABAg

"The people who feel that they need to defend cheaply produced, trend-chasing, and intellectually bankrupt shows like this clearly do not have the foresight to see that history will not look back kindly on these types of dumbed-down reboots. Animated shows like Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Bojack Horseman, and Avatar The Last Airbender will be remembered because they were either great or contributed something to the genre that hadn't been done before.

People whose opinions are soured on this show based on the style and comedic focus don't feel that way because they believe that Thundercats is the holy grail of children's television. It's because they're sick of seeing these unambitious attempts to recreate the success that Teen Titans Go had. These shows are lazy - plain and simple.

Fun fact: if you hadn't realized, the Teen Titans are owned by Warner Brothers - meaning TTG is a licensed property and Cartoon Network has to pay a percentage to them. Now, it couldn't be that CN just wants to recreate TTG with a property they already own just so they can improve their profit. That would be very cynical and definitely not reflective of the true intentions behind making this show.

In that regard, I would say that Tyler Durden is a very good example of a skinhead. Fight Club is vague on if Tyler has any racial ideology. He was all about social class.

"It can't be a coincidence that you released this video after I just  discovered Buckaroo Banzai. It must be a sign! On topic, I'm glad I got the chance to appreciate and own this film, though I can understand why others wouldn't get it. At first glance, Buckaroo Banzai feels like one of the movies that MST3K made fun of (like Space Mutiny, Future War, and Time Chasers), and Lithgow's performance is pretty bizarre. It's also slow in its pacing before it really takes off. And yet, if one pays careful attention, it's very funny and cleverly written. It also resonates with other cult films like They Live, Escape from New York, and Big Trouble in Little China. In way, it also slightly resonates with Dr. Who and Back to the Future. It even inspired parts of Wes Anderson's Life Aquatic, which is one of my favorite films. I concur that there is much to learn from Buckaroo Banzai, not only in terms of sci-fi fantasy adventure, but also in terms of absurdist theater and sci-fi satire.",0,0,2018-05-31T13:57:39.000Z,Cephalopod51,UCxSS9Bm3wrpY8iCP4HzfF2g,ht-4Q8rQeu0,True,Ugxfgxt3Q-cImIlMQGN4AaABAg

"I understand the whole just let kids have their cartoons. But most of us grew up with shows like ThunderCats. So to us seeing it dumbed down and not taken serious is upsetting because as adults we feel that a show should grow with us and prove we should also be taken serious. Ironic that it be a cartoon incredibly cheesy to convey maturity. 
   Or perhaps the dislike of the show is created by someone who so clearly is out of touch and comes off as a hipster trying to be ironically pretentious. 
 I did not watch the Reboot because I did not have the ability to at the time. But back in 2011 if I could I would’ve given it a chance. Making a crazy cartoon come across more mature is not a terrible idea. But from what I’ve been told they took it serious to the brink of boredom.

"I liked the old show as a kid and was happy to see the 2011 reboot turn it into something I enjoyed as a ""grown up"" - the reason I hate the new show is because it looks so dumbed down and similar to everything else CN is putting out. Kids cartoons don't have to be dumb. They can be fun and creative without resorting to soy boy humour. 

The Roar team watching the original show and saying to themselves, this show has silly bits so lets turn it into a comedy. But there was so much more to it. There's a whole mini doco online that shows the amount talent and effort went into the original. And in turn, the amount of effort and fan service that went into the 2011 reboot. 

 I honestly can't believe that you saw this controversy and came up with ""get over it, grow up"". I see a debate on artistic integrity vs ""fuck it, lets make some money"".

Artist integrity for the sake of an example,  is the difference between Spiderman 2 and Amazing Spiderman 2. Thundercats Roar looks subpar and people called CN out on it. If the wanted to be so far from the Source materiel, they might as well have made a new show. BUT no, they wanted to generate interest and in turn, possible sales figures, by tapping into an existing IP. you can't dig up something that has a fan base, turn it upside down and then expect fans not to be upset.

And the TMNT comparison has some merit, BUT we didn't have Leonard walking being like ""have you seen my slicing stick?""

"To be honest, I think the fact that original Thundercats was so goofy and dumb is part of the reason people are so resentful of this reboot. People remember watching the original series as kids, in many cases loving it and finding special meaning in it, but if they go back and watch it now, it can’t make them feel that special happiness that they remember, because it’s way dumber than their kid brains realized. So they hope for a reboot that can appeal to them in the same way that the old series did when they were kids and make them feel happy memories again, but instead they get this daffy comedy that is clearly aimed at a particular, familiar audience.

Of course, the people who wanted a more emotional and mature reboot already got one back in 2011, so there’s still really no excuse. :P",0,0,2018-05-31T00:27:09.000Z,Luke Schwiebert,UCEGDzEyIJ1sBsQiPJnRm-WQ,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,UgyHRloignrwkQNbpuN4AaABAg

"I honestly didn't like Buckaroo Banzai the first time I saw it.  I didn't know the whole gag it was built around was that it was a lampshading parody of pulp fanservice and felt that it was creative concept that failed to realize it's full potential.  I still got laughs out of a lot of the straight-faced absurdity, but felt that there wasn't enough world-building and character dynamics to flesh everything out to make the whole thing click.  Once I gained proper context for what it was going for and that the callbacks to a greater universe that never existed was the entire thesis of it, I suddenly had a lot more respect for it and see how it's only grown more relevant as popular media has evolved more and more into the very thing Banzai was playing with.",0,0,2018-05-30T18:00:18.000Z,The NPC,UCWSYBoh0_VHq_rRBPbchVqQ,ht-4Q8rQeu0,True,UgwiYSOq5DCUCrkS49Z4AaABAg

"Aside from all the other bullshit you spew about the people who are taking issue with this new show (seriously, cut it out with the whole ""THIS Is what  your upset with? Don't you care about real issues?"" angle, it's manipulative and hypocritical, it's not like you're making videos about environment conservation or how to help war torn nations, you're only looking at the controversy of this one show, of course this is the only controversy you're going to see us talking about, you lying ass)
Is someone really paying you to further that ridiculous lie that no one watched the 2011 Thundercats? It was the most watched show on the network after the other one that they cancelled because it was popular with girls. It was watched almost twice as much than the cheap as crap flat flash cartoons that the network was trying to push.
I don't know how it is you found the gall to push the idea that wanting more of the 2011 type of show is magically something nothing wants (even though it's what kids almost always like the most) while trying to lie to our faces that saying not wanting more star vs and teen titans go is ""not letting kids have their thing"". If you pay the littlest bit of attention you can see easily that the Avatar style is just as much what kids are loving as the Steven Universe style. One isn't more the kids thing than the other, and the networks that are playing the god awful flash cartoon marathons are the ones trying to keep the cartoons that are trying to be Avatar from kids. Disney is really the only one that is doing it right, giving kids half and half by letting kids see the cartoony Duck Tales and Star vs while also providing the actiony Guardians of the Galaxy and Spiderman cartoons
You try to push this idea that because Thundercats was dumb in the 80s, that, somehow it has no reason trying to be deeper when they had a new crack at it 25 years later?
Well how about you open your ears and listen to the fact that trying to take a cartoon that was all about fighting by a moral code and trying to turn it into a gummy goofy comedy has even LESS of of a reason to happen, and it's not me who came up with that, it came from the THOUSANDS of kids who it's being aimed at who are loving that CN is bringing back the action-comedy mix that was the older Teen Titans cartoon and would have loved seeing new episodes of an Avatar-esque fantasy show 8 o'clock on saturdays with their friends.
I have no idea how it is you pulled it out of your butt that somehow not having another one of dozens of dumb comedies with no moral lessons was somehow robbing from kids but you need to lie about no one watching the serious show was warranted when the networks are actively robbing kids of chances to be asked to get invested in the stories they see.",1,0,2018-05-30T13:49:54.000Z,Dominic Proctor,UC2g5RW0Z0S0aXAE465fsVuQ,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,UgwzSDLeruSK1CqZp0J4AaABAg

"Eh.

I get that it would have meant a lot... if it hadn't been super-obvious to us, as the audience, that Thanos wasn't going to let Quill kill her. He didn't do anything smart or cool or tricky, he just assumed that Thanos would simply stand there and let him end her life. You say ""in a world without the reality stone"" but if he hadn't had that, he would have just used the Power Stone to protect her, or the Space Stone to take her away, or any of a thousand other possible things that wouldn't have needed an infinity stone to stop ""a doofus with a gun acting like Thanos isn't standing right there.""

We, the audience, knew there was no chance she was going to die, because the movie telegraphed her importance to the soul stone so hard a royalty check was sent to Morse's grave. And, as you yourself had a whole section on in (one of) your review(s) on how bad BvS really was, there's a difference between intent and execution. When Quill's ""ultimate moral decision"" was based on a moment that, for us the viewers, was basically ninety seconds of people trying to pretend the foregone conclusion isn't foregone, it loses its meaning. Maybe that's what the movie-makers intended the scene to mean, but they botched the execution.

"this movie got me into heavy metal music. i think i was the only black kid that was into it, even to this day. i got into def leppard and other rock bands back then. 

if you were watching the cartoon back when i was, then saw this movie, it would make your head spin. i was not expecting death and drama at all. none of the 80's animated movies i saw back then did anything like what Transformers the Movie did. they never killed off characters, especially lead characters. i remember at the time i saw this movie at 11yrs old, when Prime died, i remember being in shock, then when his body turned black and grey, that fucked me up even more. i never cried, but i felt empty and depressed. from there i was like, who are they gonna kill next. so when Jazz and Cliffjumper were in trouble, i was like, fuck!!! my boys are done!! the Junkions, thank god for them, the mood was lightened a bit. 

i loved Hot Rod. he wasn't much of anything after Optimus Prime was resurrected, though, at least in the US cartoon. i think he had a better role in the Japanese animated series. i like that in season 3, maybe four, Hot Rod/Rodimus, was struggling with taking over and living up to Optimus Prime's leadership. that particular season made for more compelling stories in terms of someone having conflict with their abilities to lead or be put in a position that never had experience in, and how to power through it. in this movie though, Hot Rod was awesome.

though Galvatron is Megatron, just not the same. Megatron was a very well done villain. Megatron, Starscream, T-1000 and Joker are my favorite villains.

question. why was Starscream the only transformer to come back as a ghost? Prime was a zombie, but no ghost. (both events in the 3rd season i think). no ghost for wheeljack, windcharger, prowl...the inconsistency of G1.

As for the 2011 show, I thought it was alright, though I don't think I ever finished it.  I do wish more western animators WOULD follow the Avatar paradigm of creating an epic show with a definite beginning and end, with a good mix of serious drama and light-hearted comedy.  I pretty much have to go to anime for that(and that can be a mixed bag itself due to cultural differences), and would love to see some competition from the west.

"I remember when I first read about the Muppets getting a new primetime show on ABC in 2015. I was pretty excited mainly because I enjoyed nearly all of Jim Henson's creations, and I was sad that Muppets Tonight got pulled so quickly.

I watched the first episode and... good lord, these characters were flat out _murdered._ Kermit was bitter and didn't give a damn about anyone. Miss Piggy oscillated between rampaging terror and tinpot dictator. Gonzo was a backstabbing jerk. Fozzie had various neuroses that ranged from cringeworthy to maddening. Don't even get me started on The Electric Mayhem. The reaction, as you might imagine was pretty bad, enough for ABC to take time off to retool it (in the middle of _the first season_ ). It was a definite improvement, but the damage was done, and it was not renewed for a second season.

I thought the concept had plenty of of potential and could've become a pretty funny show if only it hadn't gotten off to such a rocky start. So I didn't feel good about ""dark 'n edgy"" characterizations effectively killing the show. I was actually bummed for a while. But I didn't fly into a rage about it, and I certainly didn't harbor any pretensions about it ""ruining"" the previous, better incarnations of The Muppets. Why?

Because _they ended._ They were long, long over. Done. History. _There was nothing to ruin._

Times change, ideas change, audiences change, and new creative teams get new ideas of what's cool and what will sell. Sometimes these ideas work; sometimes, as in the case of the Muppets, they don't. But I will not rail and rage about networks adapting to the times, trying new things, and appealing to what audiences and consumers (particularly consumers of what their advertisers are selling) like NOW, watch NOW, give a damn about NOW.

In brief: Your childhood is over. Grow the hell up.

(Footnote: Pretty much the only thing I remember about Thundercats were the parody drawings my 5th grade class made, some of which I thought were pretty funny. I remember ""Lion-Odor"", ""Panthro-up"", ""Cheaterah,"" ""Tiedgra"", ""Wileyfat"", ""Wileysnitch"", and ""Bum-Ra"".

"I thought you, Moviebob, of all people would understand. Cartoon Network doing this to ThunderCats is the same as what Micheal Bay did to your beloved Transformers: Sucking the soul out of a franchise. You did a ""Really That Good"" on ""Transformers: The Movie"". The same earnest energy and talent that infused Transformers also was infused into ThunderCats. That earnest energy is the reason ThunderCats held on long enough in a generation's collective memory to be an item of nostalgia in the first place. 

You can say that the 2011 series was wrong headed, boring, and soulless for going in a pure action direction. I liked the 2011 series, but I won't argue against your charges. That said, I would argue that ""Roar"" is wrong headed and soulless for going in a pure shallow comedy direction. I can argue that because I've seen the director interview. I'm glad he enjoyed the comedic elements of the original 1980s run, but there was more to ThunderCats than comedy and he completely ignored all those parts and appears to be going shallow. If the director had gone in a comedic direction with a nod to ""My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic"" and ""Steven Universe"", I'd say, ""Fine, this isn't for me, but at least ThunderCats is in good hands.""

"I'm going to kick the beehive with this but Bob...you're just wrong on this. 

People are upset with the new Thundercats for a multitude of reasons outside of 1980's Nostalgia and I'm going to explain it to you because you handwaived a lot of legitimate complaints that people have towards Thundercats Roar. 

1. The 2011 Series was actually pretty popular despite not being advertised and suffering from timeslot shifts. People were hoping that the 2011 series would get a new season because the effort that they put into it showed and it caught on with kids, teens, and adults alike. Not just because it was ""copying Last Airbender"" which is actually a moot point because 9 years prior, CN got massive success with the 2002 He-Man reboot.

2. Thundercats Roar is literally going the Teen Titans GO! route. The previous series which is beloved and ended abrubtly, never had a proper follow up, only for the next series to be some cartoony nonsense that's probably going to begin lampooning the original series and the 2011 reboot essentially spitting in the face of the fans. This is actually worse than Teen Titans GO! because in this instance it feels less like a genuine attempt at making a good TV show that will help grab audiences and more like an attempt to create the next Teen Titans GO! so that they can have some other cheap and easy to animate show hogging all the timeslots on TV. 

3. The Calarts style is not some buzzword. You don't have to go to Calarts to do their style just like you don't have to be born in Japan to draw Anime. Remember 1990's comics? Was every overly muscular character packing several guns and gritting their teeth drawn by Rob Liefeld? No. This is a tired art style that people are sick of seeing. We're aware that art styles go through phases and it's best to emulate what's popular to draw attention but is this style really popular? CN's ratings have been slipping for quite some time now along with Nickelodeon and Disney. Everyone is apparently  ""baffled as to how this could be happening and what can we do to stop it?"" but...ya know...call it a hunch but I think it's the over reliance on the same unpopular art style and lazy cartoons?? Naaaah it's just that Millenials hate new things and are trying to kill cartoons right? It's our fault that they can't make a product worth watching. 

4. Side point. But I find it funny that you tell us to go and care about something else (as if we can't care about multiple things at once) while you're complaining about us complaining. Don't you have more important things to talk about? I'm aware that this is a Tu Quoque but I think it perfectly illustrates your lack of self awareness. You even said in this video that you can't bring yourself to care and pounded that point home by making it known how little you care in the description. You don't care and you want us to know that you don't care by you writing a script, recording audio, editing a video, giving a description, charging your patrons, linking other videos you've done, and posting links to your website and blog. I can just feel the apathy from you towards this show.

5. Bottomline. You just wanted to massage your own ego by misrepresenting what people are actually mad about. Trying to be the apathetic ""Shut up whiny fanboys"" guy online is done far better by Adoseofbuckley and he actually points out where he's being hypocritical.

"I think you miss the point on why people are upset. Just because a concept sounds ridiculous doesn't mean it can't be done well and have meaningful depth. Superheroes are in themselves a cheesy thing but can still be interesting because the writers put in the effort to make them relatable and believable as characters in themselves. Cartoons don't have to appeal exclusively to children as good writing and art will always have lasting quality, like with Dr. Suess.

Having watched the Thundercats reboot myself, I can say it was good in that it had a lot of decent world-building and character development that kept it going without degrading in quality like many other cartoons did (Dexter's Lab, The Powerpuff Girls). It deserved a chance to finish its story before being cast out into the trash bin of unfinished shows with the likes of Green Lantern: The Animated Series.

Simply dismissing people's dislike of something as fan outrage without any in-depth, thoughtful, discussion isn't constructive critique.

"Obama wasn't a good guy president. He was a president that oversaw the drone-striking of over half a dozen countries. He didn't close Guantanamo Bay, used the IRS to target conservative rivals, and was simultaneously too conciliatory with House Republicans and too frequently went around them with use of executive orders, which further normalized their use for the next guy to come into office. Obama was a politician, only ""good"" because he had a few key issues he did the bare minimum on in a direction many people consider to be good.

The whole ""this is not normal"" thing has been annoying me because this is normal.

"Before I write this, need to disclaim: I don't go out of my way to shame and accuse people of having poor taste or of 'being the problem'. Everyone has the freedom to enjoy what they want. Lastly, NONE of what I am about to say has anything to do with fans. I do not speak for them, and my analysis is purely on the nature of the culture surrounding this phenomenon.

All of that said, my beef with Thunder Cats Roar! isn't the art style or anything of the sort. Case in point, Steven Universe, Star, etc.  are shows I like. Hell, I don't even care if it uses infantile/silly/toilet humor. Gumball does it and it didn't receive any flack (aside from people who literally can't find any artistic compromise and need EVERYTHING to be a certain way, even new IPs).

The problem I see that the show is damaged rather than enhanced by using an already-established franchise as its setting, let alone one that does not have a history of using this art style/humor. Had it been slightly repainted it still probably wouldn't be considered 'original' (nothing really is anymore) but it could at least have claimed to proudly stand on its own two legs.

Yes, the original Thunder Cats was goofy and corny (perhaps intentionally or maybe not), but if it ran again using the exact same formula here and now it would be laughed off because of that. 2011 Thunder Cats took the beefy, comic-bookish aesthetic and streamlined it whilst attempting to make the show less corny and more mature. Did it work? Maybe not enough to save it, but it certainly did not suffer a stillborn reception as this show has received.

Overall, I think a franchise's history should be respected, and if its successors cannot embody, improve, or in some way relevantly be impacted by that history then it is better to be brave and bold and carve out a fresh-faced franchise rather than alienate it from itself and pollute its own success.",0,0,2018-05-28T19:45:16.000Z,Classy Villain Gaming,UCpzfqApiudOdqDeGtDVtovg,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,UgzCThKubegq36DaqKl4AaABAg

"Wow, way to not actually pay attention to what brought people Ire, considering most of your talking points have quite thoroughly been refuted, and the opposing position being based on statements from production staff that outright said they were a successful product, but were screwed over by Cartoon network after the show had been renewed for its second of only 2 planned seasons, which was in production since the first season--even with the harm the massive hiatus in release the show suffered AND the screwing over of its time slots--did not do much worse than season 3 of Adventure time.  Instead CN got a Lego show that did nowhere near as well despite prime placement (and for 2013 was considered to have bad ratings), but was cheaper to produce so lasted only a little bit longer.  Lego Chima, incidentally, was a disaster for Lego and CN, and part of the citation of CN's decline in ratings numbers which have curved far outside the 5-10% overall drop in cable viewership.  Thus it is no different than CN's arbitrary cancellation of Symbiotic Titan, Young Justice, Green lantern the animated series, or the rest of their older kid-to-teen-oriented programming over the years despite those all having stable audiences and viewerbases.
Had the 2011 series not been screwed over like that, there likely wouldn't have been a blowup about this.  As Then you'd have the balanced-but-campy 80's show that's a Nostalgia garden, then the serious reboot allowed to run to completion but despised for reasons the Nostalgia-laden ignored was also in their thing, and then the goofy one just having fun with the setting.  But because there was bitterness left from the arbitrary canning or the last incarnation, it was likely just too soon to consider approaching it from an angle (the teen titans go/Powerpuff reboot-esque show) that has received so much negativity for the network since 2013, especially at a time that CN is trying to win back viewership when the network is suffering its lowest ratings ever, even in comparison to other networks of a similar programming nature.
After all, when CN's Older-teen-and-adult-oriented overnight programming block Adult swim consistently matches or outrates the implicitly-child-demographic programming a station runs all day at the most convenient viewership times, you have a severe problem.",0,0,2018-05-28T18:38:20.000Z,Des Shinta,UCJITRl8lKLOFDBarn13-KLQ,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,Ugw8MKql5O0m0HAu-HZ4AaABAg

"What was it Linkara said about the toxic nature of nostalgia?  ""The idea that your past is more important than someone else's future.""

My prime disappointment with the art style is mainly that it always looks the same and it feels to me like it looks like it does because it's easy to animate, not because somebody wants to stylize it that way.  Yes, the art looking all the same is an argument that applies to the style of cartoons in the 80s.  I don't defend 80s cartoons, most of them are shit and even the good ones I can't call good without multiple qualifying asterisks.  Honestly, TV animation is always like this, though.  Shows that actually experiment with the animation (like Batman TAS using black cells instead of transparent ones so they could do more elaborate tricks with shadows) are pretty rare.  TV animation is always trying to find the cheapest way to animate.  At least we're finally moving past the point where everything looks like shitty puppet rigs in an older version of Adobe Flash that was everywhere in the mid 2000s.

I'm disinterested in Thundercats (never even got into the original), so I can't get upset about it. On the whole, I'm just annoyed every time a reboot of an old cartoon comes up because I'd rather see something new put out.  Say what you want about the 80s cartoons, at least they were more or less original ideas - if you stretch the definition of original enough to include the kind of corporate inbreeding that produces copycats.  If people actually wanted to respect the spirit of 80s cartoons, I'd say they ought to be looking for a wide variety of trial-and-error concepts all vying for attention, letting what sticks rise to the top and everything else just die off as nobody watches it.  That's what the 80s were really about.
And if you really want to have the spirit of the original, you know all these old cartoons have DVD box sets, right?  Why worry about trying to capture the spirit of the original when the ACTUAL original is just one visit to Amazon away?

That said, isn't it a little bit hypocritical of you to tell fanboys to grow up when you went into incoherent rage over MB's Transformers?

Also Thundercats 2011 wasn't fully serious, it was serious at the start and overall serious but it did have lighter moments.

It even got the second season approved and while they were working on that, think they got 6 episodes down Lego decided to do the ""Legends of Chima"" which was a cheaper cartoon to sell toys, and probably gives Lego more profits too so Cartoon Network took that and rescinded the second season of Thundercats 2011, which is a shame having recently rewatched the series, it felt like it really had only 2-4 season MAX unless they were going to start making new things after Mumm Ra.",0,0,2018-05-28T16:27:17.000Z,Kevin S.,UC3HVLNMi4yyuMbY67bPVMKQ,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,Ugyk9Xn6G4UVfl-WFLd4AaABAg

"I liked the original Teen Titans and then this show came out and ruined my childhood! With a anime style show with weird music and watered down retelling of my favorite stories. But I kept watching it, gave it a chance and Teen Titan became a show close to as good as the ORIGINAL COMIC that I loved so much. Still mad there was no Wonder Girl, but well, D.C. rights are a mess. Then Teen Titans Go came out, and all those kids who loved the first show had the same reaction I had when the first cartoon came out, I laughed. I thought Teen Titans Go was a silly kid show and had no issue with it, gave it a chance. The first couple of episodes in season 1 were rough, but they hit a stride and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th season episode are hilarious, There are over 200 episodes of Teen titans go! It is fourth wall breaking (they know they are stupid and the ""fans"" complain that they are ruining their childhood, but the kids actually love them) has no narrative so you can watch any episode in any order and or just one and get the story, unlike serialized show on the network who are better to watch in order and on DVD. Plus jokes about 80's and 90's stuff the intended audience wouldn't even have been alive to get that are there for the parents to enjoy. I hate to say it, but I see why they are doing away with the episodic show, They want to have something to show, in no order, to fill out 8am to 4pm. that is 10 minutes long and self contained. and they can show 2 every half hour between commercials.

"So the comments and sometimes Bob goes into this notion like 20 and 30 year olds should remember that shows like Thundercats: Roar, Teen Titans: Go, and so on are not made for them.

I'm coming at this from two perspectives: someone who likes cartoons and a parent.  As someone who likes cartoons, there are cartoons I like and I'm good with my kids watching.  Among them was the aforementioned 2011 reboot of Thundercats, the original Teen Titans, The Amazing World of Gumball, Young Justice, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Avatar: The Legend of Korra, Star Vs the Forces of Evil, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Steven Universe, and Voltron: Legendary Defender; those are just ones I can think of off the top of my head on network television right now.  

The shows generally have positive messages for the kids, the animation quality is decent to excellent, and I can sit through them without wanting to plug my ears or throw my eyes at the screen.  Keep in mind my family doesn't watch much in the way of TV, streaming or cable.  When we do sit down to watch something, it is something we agree we like and want to share what time we do get together as a family watching.  I work a *lot* of OT, homework piles are bad and getting worse, so what time we do get to share with each other needs to have some quality to it.  So sometimes we default to one of the shows I mentioned, a Ghibli film, Summer Wars or a similar film.

So yeah, I'm all for ""Letting the kids having their own fucking cartoon. Goddammit.""  I'm down for that.  I was a kid once.  I grew up on the original Thundercats, TMNT, and all the rest that are, in many ways, damned cringeworthy in the plotting and animation watching them as an adult.  The animation and stories that still hold up for me, the ones I want to own on Blu-Ray or digitally, are works like those above and Batman: The Animated Series.  Hell, it's been so long I forgot there were so many damned episodes of the original Thundercats and I'd give that a viewing just for kicks.  

In a lot of ways I think Netflix is leading the newer charge for quality kids' content, between its work with the Avatar team on Voltron: Legendary Defender, and the host of stuff from Dreamworks.  The Netflix subscription is worth the cost for entertainment for the kids alone in my book.

I don't care for Teen Titans Go!'s animation, I found Batman: The Brave and the Bold rather hard to watch, and I'm not a huge, huge fan of the new Thundercats: Roar animation.  I don't see myself watching it.  So in all likelihood my kids won't either, but if other parents let their kids that is really their call.  At the end of the day we're not just talking about ""what the kids are going to watch"", we're also talking about ""what the adult(s) let the kids watch"".",0,0,2018-05-28T14:02:07.000Z,SarenthDricten,UCrkyrBVMrin4Eqfoaion0fg,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,UgwaIqWPmyYqAELJ0Xx4AaABAg
"agreed this isn't the end of the world and maybe it will lead to something better-like a comic series in the art style i like-the classic or the reboot i just am not a fan of this so ill just ignore it. 

but there is one thing i need to mention the reboot tv series wasn't canceled by low ratings it was canceled for low rating , rating play a part but not for that reason.  it was the toy line. the toy line was late and poorly distributed and not selling well because of that they moved the show to a dead time slot where viewer ship is low, they did the same thing with masters of the universe and toonami because someone at CN likes killing things that people like. the ratings for thundercats stayed good for most of the series it wasn't going to be a block buster but it was still popular and the creators don't even know why it was canned",0,0,2018-05-28T14:00:36.000Z,Chaosmage42,UCAjHkB5FdoK1Lt3BydwSxXg,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,Ugzt_TI8V74-OUw8nZN4AaABAg

"Other points to be made.
1) Most of the ""Thundercats was awesome"" nostalgia just comes from the theme song. The show itself (apart from maybe the Trials of Liono arch and the Lunatacs arch) was silly.
2) COUNTERPOINT, but with Bob's transformers Really That Good and Really That Bad Batman v Superman, there is indeed meaning in what we find as childhood products because (this is how I internalized it) the audience is a part of the art.
3)The ""Cal Arts Style"" thing  (And this is a former hater sobering up) really comes at the ignorance of other contemporary shows or other eras of television animation. For every Teen Titans there were 5 Totally Spies, for every Ninja Turtles there were 10 Biker Mice from Mars, for every Transformers there were 5 Inhumanoids Trends happen................and while we are here; Steven Universe, Adventure time, Mighty Magiswords, and Thundercats Roar seem to all have a fantasy RPG aspect where swords and sorcery are an afterthought to just goofying around in a village for a while.
4) Really should be called ""Thunder Cats Meow"" or ""Thunder Cats Neko"" or something else cute. Would have softened the blow.
5) I call this THE ADAM WEST LAW: If your franchise takes a funny turn, it will be around forever. Take this as optimistic.
6) Yeah, look at how much LESS Teen Titans Go we got by complaining about it. HATING DOESN'T WORK. 
7) The 2011 Thundercats already happened. The drama fans GOT what they supposedly wanted and FAILED to support, celebrate, or watch the show. FAIL ON THE FANS PART.
8) Glad you are not talking about Marvel or DC, Bob. It is a long time between Schlocktobers and Simpsons controversies.",0,0,2018-05-28T13:52:34.000Z,butchdeadlift10,UCYXwZ1BhemjBbxvCpyCkxbg,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,Ugy72fov5P6cxfpzD3h4AaABAg

Cartoons are just made differently now. Kids have, notably, been dwindling in attention span with every generation. My parents read comics and played table top RPGs. I watched TV and did chat rooms. My kid has at least 3 devices blaring entertainment at her at all times. So of course this version looks all....stupid like everything else. All our stuff looked kinda the same too, and our parents thought it was rubbish. 

My thing is.....kids today don't know what Thundercats is, nor will they ever givashit.

"For all it's issues, 2011 Thundercats was a pretty good show and an unexpected variation on the series lore.  But once again the downfall can be put squarely on the shoulders of Cartoon Network. Showing all the new episodes in a row, repeating those same episodes twice over before showing new ones, moving timeslots, almost zero promotion after the show started, and then not even advertising when new episodes were starting. All that coupled with their demands on the backside for a certain amount of money from the action figure sales (and to be fair most of the Bandai TC line wasn't that great but BoA had that history  going into the line) pretty much killed any chance for the show to succeed. There's a reason I say when show fails due to the network being clueless on how to handle it, it's been 'cartoon networked'.",0,0,2018-05-28T09:34:03.000Z,SuperFireDagwon,UC3pYNSP60CJYmfns0Vu_Zmg,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,UgxqQ6oOUUKf2xiHO354AaABAg

Not the first won't be the last. Love the idea. I personally have never watched a video game viewing session view before. But i agree with alot of the other comments. 1 dead space one the feed with the views is too much. bring the video in tighter doesn't need to be a face cam but no need to show the table with soda/beer cans on it. the game video should take up the majority of the screen. 2 work on the roles of the cast. no need to change the members of the cast just give everyone their roles and let them work in that space. If one person is going to be the play by play for on the screen action let them do that. If one person is going to bring up random colorful facts do that. and if one person is going to just make jokes let them do that but the timing has to be right so people aren't stepping all over each other feet that leads me to number 3. either do a dry run where everyone loves over the footage gets some notes and or jokes to use and uses those as a guide or section it out and do retakes of things that didn't work to well or both.

"I think you can boil most fanboy's rage down to: ""we don't like this art style"", which is the same for the latest TMNT cartoon.
I think we can safely assume that the style of animating cartoons we grew up with died when Young Justice was replaced with Teen Titans go.
I personally don't like this style, but if the story is good, it can still be worth your time (just look at great shows like Steven Universe, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, etc).
Honestly, I kind of wanted to rage at this reboot due to its art. But the more I thought about the original show, the more I realized this reboot would be perfect to spoof and make fun of the tropes of 80s cartoons. Because if you think about it, the 80s cartoons Bob mentions all kind of suck. Sure, they looked amazing and we remember them as amazing; but it's just our nostalgia goggles that keep us from out loud that the stories were horrible.

I really feel like this is the exact same dynamic. Do you not?

The goofy tone is one thing, and I can't comment much on the writing direction--But I would argue that Thundercats Roar's visual aesthetic (or at least character design philosophy) is objectively bad, and I'm willing to cite my art degree to back that up; even if the intent is something round and bouncing, it's still done terribly.

But I also 100% agree that the old shows were in no way some kind of untouchable genius, and that fanbois need to learn to chill. I'm angry and disappointed with this direction of Roar, but I'm also not gonna lose sleep or waste too much time talking about it; as you say, there are way bigger things to be worried about right now.

"Don't criticize it, ""it's for kids"", kind of a dangerous position to take for a movie critic nowadays when nearly everything in cinema is a comic movie and the 18 rating never gets used any more.

The 2011 show, while competent, took itself way too seriously and is one of the reasons why fans didn't like it as much.
Thundercats Roar, plus others of that style, was made because that art style is cheap to produce.

"""Let the kids have their fucking cartoon.""
We already did. It was called Teen Titans Go, and now we are suffering the dumber stories, dumber comedy, and cheaper animation that came with having no standards for what children are exposed to. If all you eat is junk food, and never know the taste of quality cooking, then when quality cooking finally finds its way to your belly, you'll find it unbearable.

Repeated exposure is often what forms tastes in children. For me, Thundercats Roar isn't bad simply because it's obnoxious, it's bad for taking a franchise whose primary audience is now in their 20s and 30s, appealing to an entirely DIFFERENT audience, then expecting long-time fans to just climb aboard like the good little cattle they are. It is probably the only show to top Teen Titans Go for hackneyed cash-grabs, by virtue of alienating its ENTIRE core audience and appealing to the audience of an entirely different show.",1,0,2018-05-28T06:14:30.000Z,Ikrani,UCNkPBLDBWKBFU_kttMPmcaQ,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,Ugym_v2tMUxZ3fiwXIl4AaABAg

"Bob, I had to stop it when you said ""Nobody watched"" the 2011 reboot. That isn't true. I watched it, a lot of people watched it. The problem was that Cartoon Network pulled the same stunt that Fox pulled with Firefly and they changed its air time in the middle of the season with little to no advertisement beforehand. They set it up to fail. 
The problem that I have with these kinds of editorials is that when you say you didn't care much for Thundercats or the reboot or whatever, that's completely fine, but there are a lot of people who do care about these shows and what producers do with it. That's part of the problem with these nostalgic properties and people who complain about the people who complain because they're screwing with something they enjoyed as a kid. There are a lot of people who these are not just ""some cartoons"" that came on, it was something that was a comfort because it took their attention away from their parents' collapsing marriage and ensuing divorce, something that got them through while a loved one was sick and maybe dying, sometimes they themselves were injured or sick and were recovering. You can go and find interviews of voice actors who worked on these series and the anime and such on Toonami and other popular programming blocks who will tell stories about fans who came to them at conventions and said that show or whatever helped them get through a really difficult time and that it means a lot to them and it'll always have a special place in their hearts.
Yeah there's people who take this stuff too seriously, but there was no shortage of personal and life-changing problems that a lot of people were dealing with back in the day. Just try to keep that in mind when you call such people ""losers"" and suggest they need to ""grow up"" and/or ""get a life"" because that's kind of the problem, some of them had to do just that while they were still kids and they see networks and producers taking these shows and such and turning them into what looks like a ""lowest common denominator"" show and it's like seeing someone who has an old, classic car that's good, but needs some work and could be very valuable, but instead of making use of it, they use it for paintball target practice or something.

Now I actually am one of those few people who pretty much unapologetically loved the 2011 version of the series, but that is because it played directly to every guilty pleasure bone in my body, and ran a lot like a D&D adventure, which I thought was a fun direction to take the series for a ""new era"" so to speak.

Teen Titans GO! doesn't suck because it's a comedy, it sucks because it's lazy and the creative team doesn't know the source material well enough to make it actually funny on its own terms.

That's not a bad show to take pointers from and it tried to do something a little more earnest with what was a dopey toy commercial. While it wasn't perfect, at times it succeeded on crafting something to be invested in. 

Avatar started a trend in style this show followed. Popular shows tend to do that. But there was more effort there than you are giving it credit for because you saw ""a little more serious Thundercats"" and thought it couldn't work at all.

When it got picked up by Toonami it actually got the viewer numbers to get a second season, but by that point the people who would have been needed to make it had moved on.

On to Thundercats Toar, the art style is simply a money thing. The blob style of art is cheap to make and easy to mass produce, so that is why it is being g gone with now.

"Okay so here's my take on this: You can't, on one hand, grab an old brand to try to get recognizability cash from and then, on the other hand, mock people for feeling nostalgic about the brand's previous incarnations when they don't like your new stuff. That's just not fair. If you grab an old brand name, it's because people ARE nostalgic for it and you want them to be invested in your new version. If you lash out at people for not liking your(or someone elses') WILDLY different (let's agree the new style is SUPER different, and yet it's not even original Teen Titans different, it's the same goddamn design elements just abstracted!) you just come off an asshole. 

And my issue with the style is that if you look at a slhouette version of those characters all you see if a pile of lumps and they don't even LOOK like cats!

Personally I've always been way more of a fan of the Airplaine! school of comedy: Absurd situations that are taken dead seriously by the characters and writting. There is a point where self-awareness goes too far. 

Thundercats taking itself seriously is part of its appeal. Let's not forget that the shows' main characters are, from their point of view, the last survivor of their planet who BLEW UP and they land on this wild new world menaced by an immortal undead tyrant with immense power.

But at the end of the day my little brother and sister love it and it also got them interested in watching the original show so I can't be too upset really.

"First, the last Thundercats was being watched, but Cartoon Network did everything in their power to kill it without breaking contract (awkward time, minimal reshowings, next to zero marketing) because the audience it attracted was not primarily young boys like they wanted, i.e. the people who aren't super into buying toys, ergo the wrong people.

Second, you accuse the other show of attempting to be the next Avatar.  That's far from a bad aim.  Both in quality and creativity. Seriously, what of this property says it doesn't have the bones of an epic fantasy besides coming from a dumb 80s toy show first.  Yeah they decided to be serious about it and you didn't get to giggle at how dumb it was.  But consider this, IDW is presently closing out the current era of Transformers comics that have been amazing, why?  Because they  took dumb story about robots punching each other and finally made it not about robots punching each other.

Another funfact: About half the first season budget was traditionally spent on the show's opening animation sequence, as that was the part kids would see most often and associate with the show more than any individual episode's scenes.

"The first reboot of the Thunder Cats was not nearly so bad. It was just on TV which many of its fans do not watch anymore.
I am not particularly invested in this topic either way but I will say that the reason this art style is used is because it is CHEAP! It requires far less time and fewer artists saving tons of money. However, unlike in Steven Universe or Adventure Time this is not going to be a show with a good plot or story. It is going to be more Sponge Bob Square Pants level retardation combined with cheap art lazy art style that was originally going to be used for a different IP that they could not land.

"No clue what has you so salty about this. This art style is promoted because it can't be cranked out on the cheap. It's not reflected in the ratings: Unikitty is the only one that did remotely well. Not the Ben 10 reboot, not the Powerpuff reboot. The only three shows that had ratings over a million viewers last year were Regular Show, TTG and Steven Universe. TTG is a Flash cartoon that they have literally cranked out 300 episodes. Regular Show was deeply beloved and they only gave it a farewell tour in space. Steven Universe is building a rich world but the creator can and does go ridiculously slow with new episodes.

So with one popular show dead and the other one taking its sweet time, they run TTG like it's a Law and Order marathon because the other shows in this style (my go to example is OK KO) don't pull ratings.

"Having watched the original Thundercats in the 80's I could still not give a shit about this but I question their motivations for doing it.  I understand the IP has a fanbase so that's reason enough but anybody who liked the original likely will hate this and the inverse is anyone who likes this probably doesn't know the original brand so what's the point.  You have a recognizable IP with a fanbase that's never been really good so why not take a run at it and actually try to make it good rather than goof on it?

Considering Rankin Bass tried to ride the success of Thundercats with two copycat series in the two years following Thundercats, why not take one of them that no one gives a shit about and do whatever you like because no one would care.

"To be honest, I wasn't interested in watching that show in the first place.  See from what I learned in the past, the whole rebooting shows and focusing on the children would be a dumpster fire no matter what direction they go to.  Hell, I watched a couple of episodes of Teen Titans Go! until I stopped when I realize this wasn't the show I watched in the past and that damn show is still on for five god damn years and now has a movie coming in July.  There's a reason why My Little Pony works as a good cartoon, because it has an animation style that people would remember, characters that people care and are believable, and lessons that need to be learned.  That's what makes a cartoon really good.  This Thundercats thing is going to be a huge mess judging by the video and since by the same people that was behind TTG, I fear that CN will be covering 75%-80% of their schedule with this abomination and will become the next face of CN.  In fact, I should go ahead and watch the first reboot of Thundercats because, while forgettable and boring for some does have a story behind this world.

Implying something doesn't deserve that is the same shit from people who defend the Transformers films despite the comics (supposedly, havn't read them) taking the franchise to really interesting  places. If Thundercats wants to be another meme-machine like TT:Go, thats fine, kids love that stuff and none of this is to say that a franchise can't be good because of more singular aspects.

"Look, I don't expect cartoons to be directed at me, specifically, but I'd like to think think we can be critical of them without devolving into cries of  ravaged childhoods. Or trying to blame Anita Sarkeesian for no reason. LOOK AT YOUR RECOMMENDS AND DESPAIR.

There's been quite a few cartoon reboots recently, ok?  Inspector Gadget, My Little Pony, Voltron, Ninja Turtles, Ninja Turtles again.

These haven't ALWAYS been well received by the old fanbase initially, but as time passes some have proven to at least be good on their own.

My point is fanbases are pretty fickle, but this looks more of a  Jared Leto than a Heath Ledger if you know what I mean.   They made this based on the old cartoon hoping some of that My Little Pony TMNT magic would hit, but they seem to have gone too far into a direction that doesn't seem like it'll happen.

And you know, it's not like a tragedy or anything. So they made the worst version of Thundercats, so what? Maybe TC is unrebootable, like Knight Rider. But I think we can discuss that in more terms than ""well it's for kids so it HAS, by law, to be terrible.""

"You've pretty much hit the nail on the head. The reasons why 'Thundercats' fans are livid over this new show is mainly because they're 'butt hurt' over the prospect of their favorite show being remade into something like 'Teen Titans Go'. Which already has 209 episodes, and gets alot of hate on Youtube because it airs so god damn much on Cartoon Network, as well as shit all over the original show's fans. That may sound like 'man baby panicking' to most people, but I do sympathize with them. If 'Teen Titans Go' didn't air as much as it does, and didn't shit on it's formers fans with episodes like 'The Return Of Slade', it wouldn't get nearly as much hate. I was never a huge 'Thundercats' fan growing up, and I'm well aware that alot of 80's cartoons weren't exactly 'high art', but I'd rather watch them over 'Teen Titans Go'. Also, I'm honestly not the biggest fan of most current art styles these days. (With notably few exceptions) That being said, I do miss seeing a good action cartoon on TV nowadays, but sadly, they don't bring in the ratings on cable networks anymore, and some have migrated to streaming services like 'Voltron'. So I won't be watching 'Thundercats Roar' when it does air on Cartoon Network. Just like how I won't go see the 'Teen Titans Go' movie. Trends come, and go, and when animation starts to get better, I'll get back into it, and offer something better. Until then, I'l stick with my cartoon collection, and go live on another planet while earth continues to devolve into a place I don't want to live in.",0,0,2018-05-28T01:27:32.000Z,Marc Baker,UCEJz4DFFueFD-8EM_8SOBDw,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,Ugw9lPPcFIKSR6ChGGN4AaABAg

"Remember when Zelda fans got so pissed off about Wind Waker's art style? And now 15 years later we pretty much all agree it was one of the best looking games of that era while Twilight Princess, the gritty and realistic Zelda they thought they wanted, is kinda ugly, and Toon Link himself is so popular that he appears as a separate character in games like Smash Bros. and Hyrule Warriors?

Remember when Batman fans got mad that The Brave and the Bold was a more silly take on the character inspired by the Adam West version instead of another Batman TAS? And then it turned out to be a delightful love letter to Batman's history and the rest of the DC universe, and is remembered far more fondly than the more edgy attempts at post-DCAU Batman cartoons?

Remember when Star Wars fans wrote off Clone Wars for having a weird exaggerated CGI art style and giving Anakin a plucky kid sidekick? And then the show turned out to be so good that it retroactively made the prequels a little less bad and kinda redeemed that whole era, and now everyone loves Ahsoka?

I don't really care about Thundercats or Roar, and I'm not saying the series is gonna be an instant classic.

Another person who because they aren't particularly interested in something has to declare those who are and critical ""man babies"".
It can't be that these ""man babies"" have many other interests and concerns in other areas but because they take the time to be concerned about ""Thundercats Roar"" too, when that is the freaking subject being discussed, because they care to make a critical comment *on topic* they are whiners because they aren't commenting about the latest horrible thing the President is doing (and that's no sarcasm, the President is doing very horrible things, but still, not the topic here!).
It can't be that kids have TONS of other cartoons to watch.
It can't be that adults can care about and like animation too.
It can't be that while it's very easy and valid to pick out many silly things from the original ""Thundercats"" cartoon there is also a very solid, creative, and interesting mythology developed over the years and it is disappointing to see the potential for earnest exploration of that go to waste.
It can't be that attempting to bring something the quality of ""Batman: the Animated Series"" or maybe the 90's ""X-Men"" is something to hope for and seeing something similar to ""Teen Titans Go"" brought forth seems unnecessary and very disappointing.

"Bob, I think the issue a lot of people are taking is not just because it's a horrible-looking take on a property people like, it's because it's horrible-looking PERIOD.I'm sure a lot of it is butt-hurt, but I know that a lot of the rest is genuine lamenting over the TTG ascetic taking over and drowning out a lot of good stuff.  A lot of networks keep choosing the quick path to make stuff where little thought is put into things, as opposed to actual quality.Instead of renewing Young Justice, they decided to make a cheap spin-off of the old Teen Titans show a lot of people liked, hoping to cash in on nostalgia, but instead of doing it straight and trying to figure out why people liked it, they made a bad comedy show with enough flashy visual to hopefully distract kids into not realizing that they were ingesting crap.  And when people complained, they were ignored or even made fun of within the context of the show, despite many of them having genuine grievances.They did the same thing with Spectacular Spiderman and Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes.  The Marvel shows of today stink, there's no real effort or thought put into them.  If Avatar had been made today, you can bet it would be more like this than what we got.  Nickelodeon only has ONE really decent show in right now, and Cartoon Network isn't fairing much better.  The new Powerpuff Girls and Ben 10 reboots are of the same mold as Teen Titans Go, and it actually hurts that kids are buying into this garbage.  Good stuff running now like Steven Universe or Ducktales is few and far between.I remember helping keep an eye on some kids recently, and they decided to turn on the TV and watch Teen Titans Go.  Sure, my first thought was a weary thought of 'the original was better', but my second was 'I should show them those Superman Animated Series DVDs I have, show them something better for them'.  And this pair of young brothers I sit for a lot, I was overjoyed when they expressed interest in Gravity Falls, because I knew they'd stumbled across something that's far better for them than a lot of other stuff they'd see on TV.That's what I think is behind a lot of the anger.

"""Kids deserve better than this"" 
That is what you said about the TMNT movie, and the same applies to cartoons aswell

Sure there may be nostalgia factor when it comes to complaints about what is being done with thundercats but there is some merit to it. Even if these shows are made for kids, they deserve the best we can make; they don't deserve cheap cash in's. What has made cartoons like Adventure time, Steven universe, and gravity falls so great was the fact that they both fun and very well written. Sure Thundercats isn't as cool as some of us might have remembered, but why shouldn't it be that cool today? When it comes down to it, there has been some success in modernizing those old 80's cartoons. 

TMNT 2012 was a great re-imagining of the original show; it was funny and bit silly, but was also able to be a bit more mature. Transformers Prime took itself completely seriously and the it turned out to be a fantastic show. My Little Pony FiM, managed to turn a gag-worthy property, into something genuinely enjoyable. All these Franchises STARTED as nothing more than cheaply made, poorly written, toy commercials, but more modern takes on these shows, often created by those who loved these properties as kids, has shown that even something with a silly premise can be turned into something fantastic. Those old 80's shows were actually pretty bad and have aged horribly; the only reason remember them fondly is because of nostalgia; we remember the shows better than they actually were... And yet, the new takes on those old shows are genuinely good, make for much higher quality entertainment for kids and they will age much better. Kids deserve shows that are both entertaining AND well written, not mindless drivel just made for a easy cash.",3,0,2018-05-28T01:00:10.000Z,Montimation,UCZ1Z-mli8Hdy1EzvMsONFKA,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,UgwX-cg-zXVRSSH8uBx4AaABAg

For what it's worth, I liked ThunderCats 2011 for taking a Last Airbender approach to the original series, doing what it could to respect and honor the original while also updating it to fit new themes, times, and taking more critical looks at itself, the genre it inhabited, and even the real-world echoes that could be found.

BTW; to angry commenters; no, just because the art style is less detailed than others doesn't mean the writing is any better. Also, i like the art design for both the new Thundercats & TMNT.

"I’m going to have to disagree with you Bob. Being roughly the same age (holyshit, 1981? I’m actually older😭) I thought the reboot of The Thundercats was a good cartoon. I agree that it probably rode on the same tails as Avatar: The Last Airbender, and in turn was heavily inspired by Japanese animation, but allowing the creators to enhance the lore of The Thundercats is what made it really well done. I will say this however, creativity can get stagnant if a show remains on for a longer than usual period of time, and that Cartoon Network probably thought that the reboot Thundercats would bridge the gap of both our generation and those younger than me, but this even newer version on TTC (The Thundercats for short) is something that will only reach out to my children. Will I watch it, probably not, but at least they haven’t shelved it for good, and who knows maybe when we’re taking care of our grandchildren, they’ll be another reboot to this franchise that’ll either tug at our nostalgia or be an even worse show.

Late in season 2, the exploded planet they fled from reformed because of magic gyroscope.

"The one thing that made me dread this show and not hate it is that, judging from the trailer, it seems to be aping the formula that spawned the previous Cartoon Network reboots (Ben 10, Powerpuff Girls, and Teen Titans Go). Mainly brain-dead content that insults the intelligence level of one-celled organisms (unfunny humor, Internet humor, nostalgia baiting, etc). And after seeing these abominations, I hope that a sane minded parent has them watching quality shows like Adventure Time, Steven Universe, or Craig of the Creek. Kids deserve better shows that don't talk down to them or don't feel like putting in the effort.

I would love to be proven wrong and see Thundercats Roar knock it out of the park. However, judging from the batting average of their reboots (0-3), it might be best for CN to mainly focus on original content. Also, they need to get their act together on airing their shows, promoting them, and figuring out where to take the channel in the age of streaming.

The one thing that did upset me was the hairstyle of Thundercats Roar's creator. That was the moment were I became my dad and went ""Kid! Do you actually go out of the house looking like that?! Either grow an actual ponytail or cut it short!""",43,14,2018-05-28T00:24:27.000Z,chwen hoou,UC3wD8GJss24PIb3AQH1m3IA,3jV7HFrYIyc,True,UgyoKPWtdT9Vpw5YiiR4AaABAg
"I love this. “Let the kids have their fucking cartoon. Goddamnit!” Bob is on point.

I feel like this could be turned into a wider discussion about nerd man-babies and how we’re tired of their shit.

Also, something to point out in that trailer is that the lead animator or director or whatever looks to be sincerely into Thundercats and wants to make a fun and silly cartoon based off of a franchise he loves.

Honestly this doesn’t look any different than any number of artist Tumblrs where the artist is drawing cute and silly pictures of characters from Lord Of The Rings or Star Wars.

What Tundercats fans should of done instead of bashing all modern cartoons was use these reasons:

The previous reboot wasn't successful so I'm concern this one might not be successful 

CN currently has a bad track record of shit reboots and I'm concern that they will continue that track record

"You know, having now seen Deadpool 2, I kinda disagree with his comment that DP1 ""Wasn't trying to be great by having weight and depth and meaning because not trying to be great means you can get away with more"" I think it could be argued that DP2 actually did get away with more (X-Force, for example) and it did have more weight. For example, giving Wade a character arc without extended flashbacks as DP1 did. 

Also, I would guess Bob has read little to none of DP's comics, since ""everybody else in the superhero community finds Deadpool annoying and unfunny"" is also in play in the comics as well. Spider-Man, for example, in their first proper crossover well into Cable and Deadpool (it's amazing it took that long, compare to now, where the two share a long-running ongoing series where they're basically a bromance) Spidey finds Deadpool abhorrent because ""he's a thug"".

"Yeah, I have the kind of friends that go ""what a baby, couldn't he have kept it together for literally 20 seconds longer"". 
And then I'm trying to ""explain away a shitty character development choice"" by explaining how Starlord is really a mama's boy. That trauma like that actually shapes a personality, that the whole first movie is about that, that his impotence against Thanos makes him fall back on the tried-and-true, go-with-your-gut reactivity. That kind of instinct-based actionism has been his entire life until the end of Guardians of the Galaxy 1, where he grows up a little and earns the respect and affection of his team and Gamora especially. 
Now he has a singular woman that he loves back in his life.
And he even tries to do right by her, to the n-th degree, by respecting her most singular wish to be killed before being captured. And it means nothing. First, her singular wish gets denied, but that's OK because she's still alive. I think Starlord could learn to live with that, at that point, as long as he knew she was still alive. Again: He has a singular, special, female relationship in his life again for the first time since he was like 8 years old.  
And then she gets dead -and it means nothing. It's like violating her last, singular wish for a meaningful death, plus violating Peter's own internal and personal deal with the universe and himself. ""I kill her so she gets what she wants. Or she lives and can be with me.""

"First of all, completely agree with you on Boba Fett. Never cared that much for the character even though everyone else loves him for having a cool suit and.......I guess having a sort of cool voice? Idk, theres really nothing to him at all yet people love him. I also more or less agree with you about Jar Jar as well, I've never been so confused by the hatred of a character in my life with the possible exception of Rey from the sequel trilogy. I'll agree hes not exactly a great or even good character but he's certainly not the worst thing in Star Wars, not by a long shot (though I do think The Phantom Menace is the worst Star Wars film, Attack of the Clones is far more enjoyable to watch). Really, I think Jar Jar was a victim of what was ultimately the reason for the vocal fans who hated The Last Jedi, that being not getting what they expected or wanted, now I'm not saying they're wrong to dislike Jar Jar but to act like he's this horrific, cancerous wound on the Star Wars brand is just ridiculous. I kinda wish this video were a little longer as there were some other things I had hoped you'd mention, like how superficial a lot of fans are, I.E. the brief comparison between Boba Fett and Jar Jar, neither character really adds or detracts anything from their respective trilogy but one was beloved for having a cool outfit and the other was hated because he didn't cater to their sense of humor.",0,0,2018-05-24T20:46:59.000Z,MrEffectfilms,UC4kXVARa-BjMh_eNM6kzqCQ,b5An7aeVXFU,True,Ugz_xH5uRTocbB7Ug_V4AaABAg

"My 2 cents worth for DC (being a DC Fan myself): 1. Select the best playdate. Time it whenever there are few competitions. In the Philippines for example, do not air Aquaman on December, especially last 2 weeks. People are gearing up for local films festival called Metro Manila Film Fest. Time it when you think you can own the month. This is marketing wise. 2. Too dark. While i enjoy your animated series - JL, JLU, Young Justice - all of which have great twists, turns and stories, please also note that it appeals only to comic enthusiasts. Bulk of the sale of movies is due to the fact that kids play an important role. If kids will watch, then you count the whole family watching together. so instead of 2 adults, you get 4-5 people watching if you look at the average household. Plus, kids have pester power. Ergo, loosen up a bit to accommodate the future lovers of DC. This is marketing wise as well. 3. Casting. Whether we like it or not, sex sells. i don't mean to go all out sexual. get actors and actresses that look good and beautiful on camera. nice builts and curves and all. after all, these are superheroes. i am not saying, current ones are not, but add some more. 4. costumes. i know, we DC fans have very high affinity with Superfriends because we grew up with them. But over the years i have grown loving new costume designs seen at your comics or at Injustice game. For me, it wouldn't hurt to have multiple costumes in one movie. Batman, e.g., after all changes suit if underwater or fighting an ice villain to ""suit"" his defenses. Not to mention Linda Carter way back who also have dive suit and motorcycle suit and all. 5. yes i agree to not rush the films. DC you are known to come up with original superheroes and most of the time they are being copied. so please, come up with something new for the viewers. it might be SFX, or tandem of new heroes which are not done before. 6. Campaign your movie launches. Even Disney Channel promotes Avengers Infinity War. Launch in all available platforms. I am twice as much excited for the next DC movie. Please give me more reasons to watch it for 5x! (And as support, you might be interested to know that we watched JL 4x, WW 3x, etc. And we bought the DVDs, too. =) Thank you.",0,0,2018-05-24T07:13:17.000Z,TWIINZIFIED - The Philippine Twiinz Alec Pang & Manny Licsi,UCw9MmUn7YHWRFeJTPOOCYNQ,-0pgi5G68y8,True,UgwlfT2wSFQEVwTgGmV4AaABAg

"Finished the video. Citing the appeal of the X-Men as a strictly the millennial thing is a misguided criticism. Discourse between the marginalized allegorical groups and whether seeking the difficult road towards peaceful understanding or violent overthrowing of the established societies that marginalize difference is what x-men has ALWAYS been about. That same “because you’re different doesn’t make you any less” is what captivated readers decades ago, and it’s what got many audience members hooked  in the new millennium until now. They’re not perfect movies, but they get what x-men is about and what makes them great and they introduced memorable characters. These are the things that are mostly absent in first class and decide to retcon the history to focus on a love triangle for a character that was fine without one.

"I'm not sure I agree with your read on Verhoeven's Starship Troopers. Heinlein's text is far more explicit in its examination of fascism and fanaticism, and how it leads to genocide. Please keep in mind that I'm solely citing from memory, here, and it's been awhile since I've read the book (although I've read it a few times). That said, the novel is told in the first person, and we learn of this militarized society through the main character, who is gung ho, but still reflects on the horrors and genocide he witnesses. 

I know it is fashionable to say that Heinlein is a militaristic, gung ho kind of guy (seeing as he was in and loved the military), but also keep in mind that Stranger in a Strange Land is practically a hippie required text, and also strongly endorsed an inclusionary lifestyle. Verhoeven took some aspects of the book and expands them to make them a running sub-text, rather than a casual pondering by the main character on the terrible things he is doing to another sentient species--a species in the book that is otherwise not examined at all except as a faceless, mindless antagonist.",1,0,2018-05-22T01:24:10.000Z,cboehm24,UCnfXGCmMY_9p_RUBCNiPutQ,uuwxDLdXALc,True,UgzkzuZ64ynD79SG7z94AaABAg

"Even before it went into production the critics thought this was going to be the biggest bombs in film history. As the budget kept rising those doubts were magnified 10x.

In the commentary even with all the skeptism James Cameron and the cast and crew knew they were making something special. Something of this size and magnitude is rarely seen in films with real sets and lotsa practical effects. With the years up to its release Hollywood was looking for a big bio pic to take center stage rather than the honest budgets of indie films that has been winning all the awards. Titanic came at the perfect time. We needed a huge blockbuster to do well and it did.

Whatever you wanna say about the man James Cameron has always delivered when it comes to film making. He is exceptional at what he does. Sure they may be cliche at times (Avatar) but we see it for the spectacle. His films are like an amusement park ride it doesn't need to be a work of art as long as you are in it for a ride of your life.

"This whole video is pointless because nobody really makes a big deal about Mission Impossible movies. Box office wise they make average earnings while being profitable, and they are just good pop-corn action flicks that adults (for a change) can enjoy. Perhaps they still represent a genre that has kind of disappeared, since they are some of the few suspense action thrillers that don’t rely on overblown CGI, in most of them the action is extremely well directed and realistic, and yes, the set pieces have become a tradition and a must see, and they are worth it. (James Bond leans more on the larger-than-life espionage fantasy thriller, Bourne franchise is perhaps closer). Also you mention at 5:16 ""If he wanted these to be better, he could ask for the best directors and writers"". Did you think it through before you pointed that out? Have you checked the credits? Brian De Palma, John Woo (at his height), J.J. Abrams, Brad Bird, Christopher McQuarrie (he is very good in my opinion). What would you prefer? Steven Spielberg? Or Christopher Nolan perhaps?

"A couple of gems in this one. 

""Because Reed Richards is back, so he decides to fuck with him...""

And

""This pisses off Johnny Storm who wants to go kick his ass.""

Lmao. Bob, you're the GOAT. 🐐 

Only thing I'd add to FF joining the MCU is having Tony Stark or some other super genius teaching Richards about the latest technologies. 

Richards developing a new fondness of the wonders of the new world would be important to Reed's character development as he masters new sciences (and possibly experiments with or is exposed to magic). 

And maybe through his gained knowledge and applications he actually discovers the cure, but decides to throw it away—maybe even having a conversation with a X-Men character who hears about his work and teaches Richard's about the discrimination they went through (but of course that's contingent on if they ever joined the MCU). 

Side note: it would be the X-Men from the 70's who died out after the whole discrimination/Sentinel program thing, and the whole entire affair was covered up by the government until now with all the other heroes with superpowers cropping up.

To digress, I do agree Galactus should be saved for the crossover, but with also Dr. Doom deciding to aid and possibly even Thanos joining the fray which would put the power of Galactus into perspective for viewers. And then Thanos could have a realization that the cosmos would always have been in balance with Galactus eating different worlds.

It's the exact same emotional roller coaster that Scarlet Witch goes through with Vision at the end of the film: finally works up the courage to kill a loved one so that Thanos won't get an infinity gem, only to have that death negated, the gem acquired by Thanos, and then the loved one killed anyway.  It's also a very similar arc to Thor's at the beginning of the film, with Loki; and has shades of Tony Stark with Peter Parker, too.

"Haha, why fix Spiderman in the MCU? He was already perfect and miles ahead of Spidey in the Raimi films. 

Here's how we'd fix Raimi's Spidey though:

- better casting for Spidey 
- better casting for villains 
- no Jesus imagery
- better casting for Mary Jane
- no happiness
- better dialogue 
- better music
- better acting
- better set design
- character motivation that actually makes sense (i.e. doc oc wanting to build fusion reactor after wife dies for reasons)

Coming out of Avengers 4 I can see Star Lord being a changed person if they allow him to recall his past actions. I can see him being a bit serious in terms of his future heroics in order for him to never let his emotions get the best of him In a critical moment.,0,0,2018-05-15T02:36:06.000Z,M567dk,UC9D5ZYI1qMv4NppJZMUObqQ,oLvux3kpu1o,True,UgxQXnklS4mh4ZDWSyx4AaABAg

Funny this movie reminds me alot of TLJ how it just kills beloved characters and expects you to like the new ones right off the bat. and thats not all they seem to wanna end episode 9 the way the G1 sereis did  with the Autobots getting along with the Decepticons. its amazing how history repeats itself am I the only that sees these similarities.,0,0,2018-05-15T02:07:05.000Z,The 1-Up_Triforce,UCwFX5sb5sb9oOAr9jCz0h0A,_9iab0z6Kyg,True,Ugx1JNEtxjnhe80pzCt4AaABAg
