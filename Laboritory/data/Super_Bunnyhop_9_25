"If this was actually Counter Strike in VR, it would be amazing. But, nope. Its got the typical broken baloney progressive unlock system that breaks the balance of the game, especially for new players. 

Plus, there is no offline mode of any kind. No single player campaign or even bot options. So, the moment this game's player base moves on, you'll own a dead game or a new drink coaster if you've got the disc. 

Why not review PSVR games that actually got single player focused stuff? There's Bravo Team, Farpoint, The Persistence, Doom VFR, and Operation Warcade. 

Operation Warcade in particular looks fun as it is a giant love letter to the classic gun arcade games like Operation Wolf, Area 51, or Terminator 2.

"Great review that I fully agree with. Unfortunately most newly released multiplayer games these days are not without their teething issues, including Firewall.

Fortunately this game's problems are fairly obvious and (hopefully) shouldn't be too difficult to fix. Nor are they game breaking and don't detract from what is a fantastic game and an awesome online experience.

This is definitely my favourite PSVR game and is also the most fun I have ever had in an online shooter (including VR and non-VR).

If you have a PS4 and not a PSVR, I would recommend any online-FPS lovers (who can afford it) to go out and buy yourself a PSVR with the AIM/Farpoint bundle.

"This video does an excellent job of explaining how while it may not seem like a big change to simply put an FPS in VR, in reality, it opens up a LOT of gameplay options that are just impossible in a traditional FPS (short of creating specific animations). 

One moment that comes in my mind is when I was playing Fallout 4 VR. In the traditional version of the game, you can only throw grenades from the same direction and always with the same force. If say, you were standing on a ledge directly above a group of enemies that you wanted to blow up, your best option would be aim the grenade at a wall and hope it bounces back to land close to the enemies, as simply aiming down would either result in you falling off the ledge or throwing the grenade into the floor and blowing yourself up.

"Personally I think the good way to sell hundreds of hours of worth of content is to make it all interesting and engaging; either through making it a difficult or interesting combat challenge or by making it a well-told story either by NPCs asking you to do things or by notes and environmental details. This is why Skyrim is called wide as an ocean but deep as a puddle largely due to mostly bland and uninspired quests and radiant quests, with only a few stand out pieces of engaging quests and environmental stories (the Thieve's Guild quest comes to mind). Whereas New Vegas can do basically the same thing but be much more highly regarded because almost every side quest has interesting characters, plots, and are generally more complicated than going to a dungeon and either clearing it out and/or getting a thing (though I will admit fetch quests aren't uncommon in New Vegas). Morrowind does a similar thing with it's large open world but mostly by making the rewards from exploring and completing side quests actually useful more often than not and simply by letting you see more nooks and crannies of the strange alien landscape that is Vvardenfell.",0,0,2018-09-24T03:14:31.000Z,Roondar Lastname,UCTKRIcrezvCN0yLwl7i8zRQ,Q5LL3VCZC5w,True,UgxDjtorVXaNcvc8caB4AaABAg

"Who plays CSGO with speakers? ""Cutting the Pie"" is actually almost something people should learn in TF2 against sentries, besides the wall distance thing. Sentries do not attack an enemy unless enough of their body is visible, but strangely that means slightly more than half of it, meaning that corner peaking to destroy sentries with only your crosshair around the corner is almost overpowered vs non-expert engies, or those who don't have someone like a pyro helping them out, which is very rare because ""what is teamwork?"" That's why Engi is so frustrating for new and most players. Because they have to learn to divide their damage and threat output from multiple angles, and because defensive teamwork doesn't happen as naturally as grouped aggression with casual teams, especially with Pyro and Engineer. And attacking team knows that a sentry is the primary target. A novice Pyro doesn't know how extremely helpful they can be to Engineers. And an Engineer still needs to know how to angle and divide out their counter damage output, rather than standing directly on a sentry. Also knowing the often tight decisions of either whacking the Spy or getting rid of the sapper. (Though killing the Spy asap is usually more important than the sentry/sapper.)",0,0,2018-09-23T17:43:42.000Z,Josh Russell,UCt93m6ofLuYACtjsLcVo2Xw,18074QFwdmE,True,Ugz4x2yisbn3EY3iY_d4AaABAg

"I haven't played the game, but it seems to me the jammer issue could be fixed by either requiring at least some part of them have line of sight to the laptop (meaning they can't be tucked behind some busted geometry without at least a little corner sticking out- changing the placement into a game of where can it be put where the most of it is covered, or where it's trickiest to find while still working) or maybe some sort of signal tracker which indicates as you move closer to a jammer (since they'd have to be emitting a signal, which could be tracked).",1,1,2018-09-23T15:47:06.000Z,Liam Richardson,UCnhZ2N0qH9tPHeMcaY_C7tQ,18074QFwdmE,True,UgzyuUIbE2_E0ZljgWp4AaABAg

"It's awesome to get a window into VR when you're too poor to afford it yourself, thanks George! It did seem a bit unfair when you called out the peer to peer matchmaking and linear upgrade curve as things that should be obvious in 2018. Because while giant publishers/developers with lots of money have figured that out, and use their institutionalized knowledge to not make these mistakes in their later games, this game was made by a relatively small/unknown team. Cut them some slack! While I'm no game developer, I've dabbled enough to know how DIFFICULT this stuff, especially netcode is.

"8:04 did you seriously just suggest that 3d positional audio and using headphones is a new thing, think those VR headset straps are a little too tight there buddy

edit 1
9:03 your gun ""bumping into"" objects and cover and becoming unusable when too close to those objects is NOT exclusive to VR, and in games PRE DATES VR. Whats wrong with you George? Seriously sub par writing my dude.

edit 2
10:32 Its not VR exclusive to be able to prop/mount your gun to scenery for extra stability/recoil reduction, AGAIN this predates VR. Generally a good video, just a few piss poor mistakes either caused by a rose tinted VR headset or just laziness when it comes to researching whether your use of the word exclusive is valid... the 3d audio part though, christ.

Check out warowls video on ""VR counter strike"", just as enthusiastic about what VR can bring to FPS, i think you would enjoy it.

"Anyone here, that is really butthurt by George reviewing VR content, really needs to get his shit thogether. VR is a very important thing for gaming. nobody says that it is going to replace anything and half of you people must have not tried VR until now because then you would understand its importance. 
Firewall Zero Hour is doing something significant here - it is bringing tactical online shooters to a new dimension with strategic possibilities simply not executable before. I cannot understand why anyone would think this is a disservice to gaming in any way. VR  is just going to be another option in the future, similar to handhelds in a way. Just because Nintendo once released the GameBoy didn't mean that people stopped playing the NES, if you understand where i'm going with this. If you are somewhat like me, you were a fan of Georges videos because of his critical and analytical outlook on video games from a artistic and philosophical standpoint. It baffles me then, that you with that knowledge of his personality, still cannot trust him enough to accept that he is loving his VR headset for a reason. Are you really thinking all the positive feedback from VR users comes from nothing? Why in the world you people seem so offendend by this topic beats me totally.

"God, finished Morrowind just today, after I dunno how many characters, and I loved the hell out of it and it's complex world and politics and religion.

I was thinking on trying out Skyrim again at some point but... this video reminded me of why I got so angry at it and frustrated and tired and bored. I just absolutely hate the writing and characters and don't care about combat. I play RPGs to role play, not to focus on murdering shit, and Morrowind is filled to the brim with quests that don't require you to hurt anyone at all and be really fun still. But most of all I hate what they did to the dragons. My house in Balmora is an overflowing library from books I found through my travels, love reading of the lore and the diff religious and historical accounts written from diff angles that make the world feel that much more vast and real... and I loved the texts that had mentions of dragons and how rad and interesting they were. I was really looking forward to the idea of ""wow exploring what the series establshed that dragons could like they did daedra sounds awesome!"". Morrowind was hugely a deconstruction of fantasy tropes... and when Skyrim came, it WAS the worst fantasy tropes.

Hey you know this entire species of creatures that seem really complex and interesting and that had conflicts between eachother and many that allied themselves with and helped diff groups of people (hell even the spin off Redguard has one that prides itself on being ""The crown jewel of the empire"" and you have to kill because you play as an enemy of the empire, not because it's evil)? WELL FUCK YOU THEY EVIL NOW I GUESS! Why have interesting complicated morals that even the ""demons"" of the world of Nirn are actually just weird beings with morals beyond our understanding and that are called gods or devils based on if they fit basic human morals? You know that lorebook in morrowind that talks about diff interpretations of deities? How there's that almost footnote about how in Skyrim nords see this one dragon-god as a destroyer of time? WELL IGNORE THE ENTIRE REST OF THE BOOK, THAT'S ALL IT IS NOW! Oh wait why are they bad now? Dragon break is why! Even though dragons are technically the only constant on dragon breaks, so the stupid excuse they try to use doesn't work at all cause they are trying to excuse themselves with the element that can't change the thing they want to change.

And hell, I'm okay with retcons if they are in the service of something more interesting... but this ain't it. It's just dull and stupid and the antithesis of everything that made previous titles great. And this happens with every single aspect of Skyrim, not just dragons and lore... just... ugh... except melee and bow combat which is the only thing they cared to improve.",1,0,2018-09-23T02:38:35.000Z,Dragon Denton,UCgK8avxSdBfYUNBkDf8S9og,1wujJnlsJh4,True,UgxNTIWFz8loDOPuIpt4AaABAg

"It's weird seeing this reaction from the audience towars SBH and his mate's opinion on the game cos what they say is exactly how I felt like playing the game. 

The interesting element of the wworld Arkane created were absolutely irrelevant to everything that you did in the game; instead the game focused on a typical revenge story delivered through stilted cutscene and apathetic voice-acting. It wasn't captivating, it wasn't endearing and yes it does impact the game in a majorly negative way when the game frames your actions as having an influence on the world yet gives you no reason to care about said world or anyone in it. You'd think that would mean that you're free to do whatever, but then the game judges your performance and gives a strong indication on how to play the game optimally.

It also incentivizes low usage of the powers since they cost a ressource that doesn't replenish naturally so once again, optimal play dictates using them as little as possible (so no ""you're playing the game wrong"", I'm playing the game how it's apparently expecting me to play it, that is to say efficiently). But even if you do decide to go against the optimum way to play as dictated by the game and use all your tools liberally, it turns out that ""liberally"" doesn't mean ""a lot"" since you are so overpowered that any sticky situation you might find yourself into is never much of a bother. It's a really easy game where you don't need to try hard to succeed unless you impose on yourself specific challenges -- but then why not play a game that's challenging from the get go ?

"Heh, did you finish the final floor of this tower? Seems like you reached floor 23 and gave up instead of make it to 40 (which I don't recommend btw, it's SUPER punishing in the 30s if you fall). As someone with 900h+ in this shit I agree that it's a numbers game and that it's built to frustrate you rather than challenge you in a Souls like way. The stats thing is SPOT on, although some things have changed, like Haters are now the SAME level as the area you're in, but this was only done a few patches ago rather than much sooner. TDM raids just has broken matchmaking where tier 6 fighters can stomp tier 1s, so enjoy having less KC as you climb the tower. Srsly there's a laundry list of flaws I could make for this game but I honestly don't blame you for quitting at 23, at 31+ it just becomes pure cancer. Paywall thing is definitely a thing, but not a forced paywall more a ""pay to save time grinding 250k to retrieve your fighter when you die in the 30s"" type bs.

"An AMAZING tip for whoever wants to play this game on PC with a controller..specifically a Dualshock 4, and you'll get why in a moment:
since navigating the menu is so clunky, here it is what i use to do which makes it a lot more berable
use Input Mapper (or DS4windows..but i prefer the first one)
remap the Share button to Inventory, the Options button to Map, and the PS Home button to bring up the generic menu (aka ""ESC"" on a keyboard)
use the ""macro"" function to assign to the touchpad of the Dualshock 4 all the other menus like Journal and character sheet ecc(for example: swipe left to right=journal, swipe right to left=character sheet)
this seriously made playing this game SOOOO much more enjoyable

"It's good you bring up that type of model.  That's exactly why free to play games (and by extension, and even worse, pay to play) games are so fucking disgusting in design.  They quite literally harken back to a time when you the point was for you to die and spend more money.  And for awhile we had developers that were ready to grow up and have higher standards.  But then they've rescinded back into that abyss of game design whether by greed themselves or publishers realizing slowly, and over a long period of time that they can get back these types of fuck-scummery.  In the end we are left with worse and worse games.  And while it's certainly been over a year since you put this video out, we've only gotten worse since then.

And as for that DS analysis... even if someone were to go all contrarian and claim you could beat this game at Lv. 1 (I'm even sure someone will do it just to shove their E-Peen out there) it doesn't make it practical.  Just because something can theoretical be done doesn't mean that it's practical.  Hell, even when something can LITERALLY be done it doesn't mean it's practical.  The practicality of beating a game would imply it remains an enjoyable and fair experience throughout and also requires a reasonable (read NOT 100 attempts per challenge) amount of time and effort.  Claiming that someone must get lucky or else spend 100s of hours just to do something is far from practical.  In 100 hours one could learn how to play an instrument at a reasonable level and at 100 more they could master some songs.  Extend that to other fields and you also find tangible, real world benefits and an actual sense of pride.  Beating a completely one-sided fight in a limited and un-enjoyable game, though?  No.  That's not going to give anyone a sense of pride or relate to any other real world benefits.",0,0,2018-09-19T20:40:59.000Z,Desmond Brown,UCKKYYyXEBFfXsH14RV1Q3bA,n7sviJvnxZY,True,UgwRu_0qmoriLJ8yMid4AaABAg

Surprisingly, however not “super” surprisingly, she loved it! Anytime we had to stop our session, she was eager to jump back into the story to see what would happen next as well as being interested and emotionally invested in the characters and each one’s respective character arc. Which made me very happy.

She was in her late teens during the time this entry takes place, 1964. So she was actually able to relate to the characters and their respective mind-sets( i.e. Capitalist U.S. Soldiers fighting against Communist Russian Soldiers) on a far deeper cultural level than I would ever be able to. This clearly played a large factor in her enjoyment of the story.

There were a few times where she would ask me about a character and speculate (correctly, mind you) on their motivations(you know who I’m talking about) and I would have to dismiss it with a “You’ll find out, just wait and see,” or (jokingly) “Hey, you don’t like it when people ask you questions about what’s happening in a movie when if they’d just watch they’d get the answer,” and she’d laugh and say, “Yea, you’re right. That’s definitely how I feel about that. Alright, let’s find out!”

I did that for three reasons:
1.) Because I hate when people do that whether it be a movie, TV show, or video. Which clearly I got that outlook from her. 😁
2.) I hate spoilers (unless it’s a movie, TV show, book, or video game that I know I’m not going to experience or interact with.
 & 3.) I wanted every detail, story beat, action and character to be new or unexpected for her. I didn’t want her to know what was coming next, so the twists and revelations were a surprise for her. I wanted to recreate the experience we all had the first time  playing through MGS3.

When we beat it yesterday, and watched that heartbreaking ending she choked up and got a lump in her throat and almost cried. Me, on the other hand... I fucking cried. Like, actually cried. No exaggeration. I’ve beat MGS3 at least a dozen times, if not more, and I’d get a lump in my throat every time. It never fails to happen. Only this time, when Snake goes to that grave and lies the “Patriot” firearm and flowers on the grave as EVA tells Snake that the Truth of what really happened in Russia during Operation Snake Eater will forever live on in Snake’s heart and he salutes the Headstone and sheds that single tear as the music swells, I legit cried.

Seriously; if I had never convinced my Grandmother to go through MGS3 with me, that ending probably would never have hit me in the feels as hard as it did this time. My grandmother started to laugh because I was so emotional and crying but also laughing at myself because I was crying.

I let her know many times while playing, that MGS3 was my absolute favorite in the franchise mainly because of that emotional revelation and the build up to it and that I choke up every time. So that’s why she was laughing and then proceeded to tell me it’s because I have a tender heart and am really good at being able to empathize and feel other people’s emotions. Which, in all honesty, is something that I’m quite proud of.

Sorry for the long rant, once I started typing I found myself unable to stop. 😊",0,0,2018-09-19T10:03:41.000Z,InTheMindOfDavid,UCLWRTyle2m_Su6-wutmx6aw,N_-jyF987MQ,True,UgzaXNUL_o_hmnb7AQh4AaABAg

"I think I get the game a bit better. In short, the Raiden section is a dream from the imagination of maybe a typical gamer, and the game itself sort of struggles to fight back, keep some integrity as a game, and maybe help the dreamer be a better person. Short story long....

Ithink we play the Snake section of the game as a fictional gamer. This gamer is playing the first section of the ""Actual"" Metal Gear Solid 2. We, in what we believe to be reality, also get to see this section. After the natural break with the unveiling of the near Metal Gear design, a bizarre Kojima-like twist, the player gets to the end of the first section, saves the game, and goes to sleep. While dreaming, the player recalls briefly seeing a blonde partner character in  the promos, unidentified in the marketing. The player now dreams a dream in which he is this new unnamed character. Raiden is first identified as Snake, which is the best this player can imagine at first. Once he recognizes this is a problem, his codename gets changed to another video game character's name, Raiden from the Mortal Kombat series. No one else is using it, so it's fine. The dreamer is now placing Snake from the first game in a supporting role, but from a fan's perspective. The player has a few priorities: 1) recreate a new plot only using memories from the previous games, especially the first MGS, 2) this plot has to incorporate the revealed first act of ""Actual"" Metal Gear Solid 2, and 3) it must resolve the cliffhanger at the end of MGS1. The repeated dialogue is pulled from the first game almost identically. Hal Emmerich goes through the some of the same character moments from the first game, such as experiencing loss of a loved one. Which? A ...sister? Who is kind of the same as him? And... let's make it kind of romantic, so they are step-siblings, because that is the dreamer's kind of thing. Actually, let's also have Hal admit to *another* step-something relationship. His step-mom, the sort of thing this particular dreamer likes. Yikes. He also likes vampires, so that's in. Dr. Robitnik, but let's use roller-skates for him to get around. The unkillable daughter of a character from the first segment. Revolver Ocelot was involved, and didn't he have Liquid Snake's hand and part of his mind? That's back. Ughhhh.... The ninja from the first one is back. Olga will interact with this ninja toward the beginning of the game, but at the end, she will be revealed to be the ninja, when that is convenient for the plot. Raiden will have to go on a Golden-Eye style mission of defusing bombs. But the characters start to fight back a bit. We get the bomb guy to help out, but he points out the poor placement of the bombs, so now you have that as the mission, even if it kills the very character who brought it up. Well, that's over. Wasn't there a president involved? Oh, yeah, that. That ends by recreating the Nikita missile scene, but with better 3D. It's the president, so Ocelot is involved (from the cliffhanger in MGS1). Wouldn't it be cool if there were another Snake brother? He is here. He has a super suit and recreates the Harrier scene from the last one. Wasn't the president in the last one George Sears? That's Solid...us Snake. Solidus Snake. He will be the younger brother, but will also appear older, identical to Big Boss. He's working with Ocelot, and he wants to create a New Heaven, like Big Boss in the Nintendo game. It turns out the game design is really linear because the dreamer isn't a game designer. It's also a new Metal Gear. Which is a submersible directly underneath the Big Shell. And it's an Arsenal Gear, not Metal Gear. It would be cool to have a sequence like in the first one where enemies run at you. But it's a lot longer in a bigger space, and the enemies are ninjas. That's cool to the dreamer. Let's have that Patriots virus have the characters go meta as the big Kojima twist in the third act. The Colonel and Rose, the dreamer's in-game GF, are glitchy AI. And Rose is starting to be mean, like Naomi in the first game. (It's ok, in the ending she is real and happy with Raiden.) The ship design is based largely on the VR missions in the first game, which the dreamer has played a lot. There are tons of MG Ray's around. Raiden, the dreamer, is naked because of a torture scene that is nearly identical to the first game. The dreamer doesn't want to see Raiden uncovered, so you'll have to go without your hands free. You face a final boss fight with 25 MG Ray's and then just give up. It turns out Ocelot betrayed the Big Boss-like Solidus. (Actually it's cooler that Raiden is actually a former child-soldier in Solidus's army from the past Metal Gear games. That's a twist, and it separates the dreamer's identity from the game. Raiden ends up fighting Solidus to recreate the sort of hand-to-hand combat in the first one. (Also Solidus has Dr. Octopus arms, but from the front of his suit and only two, so Konami won't be sued.) The battle is at the Federal Monument because that is a memory of the dreamer, having  gone to NY on vacation once. (There are also video clips because MGS did that.) The ending has a sort of positive monologue, like MGS1, and the hero gets his girl.

"First off...you put Bloodborne as the front title and the thumbnail but in total barely talk over a minuite about it....

Now.
You talk about Old Hunters retreding ideas from Dark Souls 1...mate half of Artorias of the abyss is the same area from the main game with different lighting. I can't understand your measurements for this stuff. As a product the Old Hunters is huge, varied levels that are mish mashes of stuff seen before. The Cathedral Ward clashed with the Nightmare Frontier. The Healing church which while vaguely similar to the Dukes archives still has alot of new stuff going on, the traps, enemies that react by sound and plenty of clutter to cause it to draw them in. And a rotating middle pillar which changes the level half way through allowing you to explore to two times in different ways. The hamlet is so big its basically two areas in one. And im sorry but its nothing like Blight town.

Bloodborne's DLC adds so much additional content it doubles the number of weapons, items and attires, and much like DS3 is jam packed with extra content, small sections that are off the beaten path. Combat challenges entirely removed from the main progression path. And yet its the same price as Artorias of the Abyss. That makes it a Bargain by comparison to what was a DLC of essentially 3 repeated assets and 1 semi new section, the bosses were great in both with perhaps the exception of the living failures, but by contrast we also have the sanctuary guardian and lets not forget the crap shoot of fighting it again cloned twice over come the end.....but if we are talking as products. The Old Hunter's is one of the best content for price additions to a game I can think of.

"[SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]

You guys do realize that the ending of this game basically sorta means Solid Snake ain't shit compared to his father. Everyone thought Solid Snake was special because he inherited genomes from his father. Solid thought that he had no purpose in life other than to be a soldier because his fate/destiny (mgs4 confuses the two ironically) is tied to his genetics. But Big Boss proved that anyone can do it. And it was really a mind game at the end of the day. MGS4 is very mental. Psycho Mantis, Ocelot hypnotizing himself to thinking he's liquid and the paramedic hypnotized into thinking he was Big Boss the whole time. 

But he was just a regular old medic. As far as we could tell it wasn't like he was a battle hardened looking character. He looks kinda regular. So the fact that just with his mind he was able to become that much of a badass. Big Boss knew how to create real soldiers.That whole game was Big Boss's experiment. So you're low key just doing that motherfucker's lightwork while he's in the background continuing to scheme like it's a regular day or something. He had so much faith in you, his little soldier creation, that he was drinking martini's while he watched you work. Never even helped ya once. Think about how many times you died. He just watched all that. You dying. Over and over again. And at the end he wakes up. Look at that scene from Naruto and watch kakashi fighting itachi. Big Boss is Itachi and The Helicopter Medic is Kakashi.

"You know, a lot of what you're saying makes sense, but I'm still conflicted by it. I like most Sonic games, some of them I think are really good even, despite their flaws. I'm aware of their flaws and I'm okay with them because that's what it means to be a fan of this franchise. Sonic isn't perfect, but I still feel more invested in this franchise more so than any other. I mean I love Mario games and Zelda games, but in a more casual way, cause I know those games are bound to be good gameplay wise, but I just don't feel very strongly for those particular characters outside of their ties to a specific franchise. Sonic's different. Sonic feels like an actual character, and the Sonic universe is a vast one with lots to dig into, and I enjoy the games usually because of their stories and how the story is presented, aswell as the gameplay. Though I will admit gameplay can get pretty messy, but that's because of things like the controls and the camera having to be comrpomised to acommedate for Sonic's speed, usually because the technology available at the time simply couldn't convey said speed in a comprehensible fashion. 

I of course want to see Sonic do better, because he's proven in the past that he can be, but really he's a difficult character to make work, so anytime they do is a really impressive accomplishment to me. Sonic Unleashed is my favorite Sonic game not only because of nostalgia but because of how much they got right on their first try at the so-called 'boost formula' of Sonic gameplay. It goes to show what Sonic Team can do when they have something to work with, and in Unleashed's case they wanted to fix what they did wrong in 06, and I'm still really impressed at how well they managed it. Sure you may say the Werehog was a mistake and that it's tedious, but could you imagine what the game would've been like if it was only daytime stages? The game would be all speed, all adrenaline all the time, with nothing to break up the pace and the daytime stages would be lesser for it. The nighttime stages aren't perfect by any means but the Werehog is a welcomed edition in my opinion, and it also helps drive the story forward, and since it's a story I really like, the Werehog's inclusion is mostly positive for me.

Oh shoot I kind of went off on a tangent there, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there.

Also Forces was trash.

"Fan of the series and story up until after mgs3. They should have kept the wisemen committee angle with the twelve mysterious members, similar to the Illuminati in Deus Ex (2000). These cast and crew from mgs3 being the patriots makes no sense, while a group of twelve high ranking, shadowy, government, political, military, and financial/business leaders makes much more sense and is very intriguing. I like mgs3 but I prefer to think of the series story as being stuck in mgs2. The whole philosophers legacy thing in mgs3 kind of made no sense. China would not have been anywhere near a major role player from the 1920s-1940s. China was decimated from civil war up until and after World War 2, and Imperial Japan was much more powerful until her defeat in 1945. Japan was a much larger global role player than China from the Meiji restoration in the late 19th century, and the Russo-Japan War, to the Boxer rebellion and the Annexation of Korea and Manchuria, to the Second Sino-Japanese War leading into the beginning of WW2. Killing off Liquid was a big mistake too, although I enjoyed liquid ocelot from mgs2, it felt cheap to do it with just the doppelgänger angle with Ocelot in mgs4. It kind of destroyed Ocelots character for me. This should have been mgs4; Liquid survives and duels it with Solid atop of arsenal one last time; to me it would be quite symbolic and a nice ending to the series. Twin brothers, one of light the other of dark, opposites, Liquid superior Solid inferior. Both old and decrepit but still full of heart and fight. Their destinies firmly bound to one another. I feel we never got the proper send off for Solid and Liquid. Very underwhelming and disappointing. Just my thoughts, I prefer to play mgs1 and mgs2 while still thinking of the story as having stopped at mgs2, with Eva, Zero and Paramedic not being the fuckin patriots, just dumb. For me it’s actually much more immersive to play the games that way.",1,6,2018-09-14T21:47:08.000Z,Pfc Finn,UCfboexxlQooDMFmEibCTMsw,KO4Tusk_V2k,True,UgwaPF5W1gwzbIxcfYV4AaABAg

"I'm sorry for this but... In Peace Walker, Snake and Kaz briefly question if taking soldiers back to Mother Base against their will was ethical - or maybe in Portable Ops with Campbell. That's why you had the option to recruit soldiers connecting to different wifi networks, making it kind of difficult to recruit (genius right!?). The easy way to grow Mother Base was to kidnap soldiers.  The 'easy' way is the 'bad' way.  It is the same in TPP.  Even when you save animals, Kaz tells you to do it because 'there's money in it'.  When you grind missions in PW to get tanks, you can  a) kidnap soldiers OR  b) kill soldiers.  So the player is making Big Boss bad without realizing it...because the enemy is the CIA.  The way these games work the 'good' and 'bad' is cool because war is awful and this game teaches you that and beyond.  These games are not about Metal Gear, they are about the control of the battlefield; that today the battlefield is even inside us, physically, affecting every part of us.  From nano-machines and weapons to what we 'choose' to consume, The Patriots control everything. --- XD
While in Colombia, Snake was persuaded by Paz to check out what was the CIA doing in Nicaragua; he wanted to help countries that were proxy war battlegrounds.  In the way he teamed up with the Sandinista National Liberation Front, becoming indirectly an enemy of the US.  Snake beats the Peace Walker operation, but his trust is shaken when Miller confesses that he knew about Gálvez (Zadornov) and Paz being Russian spies since before meeting them.  And that Paz even spied for Cipher, the guy behind Peace Walker.  Miller also insisted in taking part of the growing war economy.  Confused and still haunted by The Boss' decision to give up her life the way she did, Snake felt betrayed.  But he's not evil yet.  He made peace with this messed up world, accepted the title of Big Boss and decides to fight the power.  ""Assemble the men!"" he orders Miller.
To fight the power I bet he did a couple of tours in the Caribbean and Central/South America, saving prisoners and stealing intelligence; the XOF unit of Cipher cleaned up after MSF's attacks.  After finding out about Chico and Paz being held at Guantanamo Bay he went to get them.  While returning from Cuba, the XOF unit destroys MSF's base and, Big Boss, escaping the attack falls into a coma.  9 years later he wakes up and helps his best soldier escape a hospital in the Mediterranean, splitting ways in the end.  His best soldier is taken by Ocelot, and is instructed to save Miller from a Russian prison in Afghanistan -he believes he's Big Boss.  spoiler?   Big Boss goes to Africa.
In Peace Walker when you're spotted, the voice coming from the guard's radios is the same as Miller's because it IS Miller.  Miller worked for the CIA training forces in Colombia and Nicaragua.  He also trained Mujahideen forces in Afghanistan -that's why he was kidnapped in TPP.  XOF and Diamond Dogs are Cipher rogue forces.  And Cipher is behind everything! dun dun duun Control of the battlefield analog mode!

"This review is like buying a premium high quality large supreme pizza and saying it was bad after eating it all in one sitting. 

This is not a game that's meant to be 100%ed. They put secrets everywhere to encourage players to explore, and there are 900 korok seeds to make sure that most players would have a comfortable number of inventory slots. The only thing I did 100% we're the shrines. The complaints about them all being the same aesthetic, the tests of strength, and the amount of time spent in unskippable cutscenesand loading screens is terrible, and I hope they fix this in the next zelda. However, many players who paced themselves with the game didn't really notice or mind. This also means I did very few side quests other than the shrines quests, so the ones I did do we're fun and fulfilling.

For example, there's a girl at a stable who asks you to get all 3 types of dragonflies for her sister or whatever, and I knew I wasn't going to have fun if I just searched endlessly for the dragonflies and returned asap, so I just continued with whatever else I was doing. Many hours later, I'd found all three types naturally just by exploring, so I remembered the quest and returned to get a reward. If I had done that for every side quests in the game, I would have gotten burned out quick. I think it's easy to see from the get go most of the side quests aren't super interesting so if you value your time and sanity you'll just ignores them, and having so many of means if you need some extra rupees you can look through your fetchquest list and see if you've gotten any of the items for them, and most of the time there's something. Approaching a game with the wrong mindset can be detrimental to your experience, but you can't always blame the game for that.",0,0,2018-09-11T20:28:04.000Z,Kebm,UC5koMOCdp-uEWOix2Jtk6Og,gNLMDWZY6_A,True,UgzEqDD4zSvW-qzuxwd4AaABAg

"Uhh, SteamVR is built directly on top and relies fundamentally on OpenVR an opensource initiative for VR created by Valve themselves. And they openly work with the OSVR initiative.

And while it might give you abilities you wouldn't have otherwise, I've most definitely read that PSVR is natively supported by OpenVR, and works in Steam. Apparently even on Linux.

From what i understand SteamVR is the Valve 1st party HMD (HTC-VIVE) specifically. So the lack of full support for other HMDs makes sense. Curious what the experience is without it, or if most of these tools you're using are developed specifically for VIVE, and therein lies the issue.

OpenXR (X being a symbolic representation of a conjoined A and V standing obviously for Augmented and Virtual) from my understanding it's not quite the same thing as OpenVR, and won't supercede OpenVR per se. Afaik it's an Open Standard akin to a Graphics API e.i Vulkan. And will be a layer to simplify the low-level rendering and VR specific techniques performed between GPU and HMD. I mean the Khronos Group primarily focus on graphical/compute APIs. 

OpenVR will most likely still remain, as the high-level SDK used by developers, it's a cross-platform HMD agnostic middleware for VR. Right now rendering for VR is the wild west, being rendered across DirectX OpenGL and Vulkan. OpenXR will help simplify and unify implementation efforts making it so you don't need to individually target each IHV. Microsoft are the ones being dicks, with their own entire Mixed Reality development stack, that's fundamentally single platform and proprietary. Oh and Oculus Rift, last i heard they were still pushing their own exclusive ecosystem and SDK.

Heck the LightHouse tracking stations technology from the Vive was turned into an OpenPatent by Valve. They're doing everything they can to avoid squandering VR technology and becoming defacto gatekeepers.",0,0,2018-09-10T08:18:17.000Z,Grimm Zane,UCGgGDlCfqblaMbwi5Th8v5A,pwgYgid6T6Q,True,Ugz29TbJqqwrvBAHWBF4AaABAg

"SteamVR works fine, I think your problems are only with PSVR. Try opting into the SteamVR beta, it's far far better than the ""stable"" branch but still completely stable, has tons of bug fixes and performance improvements.

Oh, and if you really just want to get into PC VR with no bullshit, give Windows Mixed Reality a try. I actually own both a Vive and a Samsung Odyssey, and I prefer the Odyssey in almost every single way. The only thing the Vive has on the Odyssey is comfort. Windows Mixed Reality's tracking is far better than people make it out to be, and the only difference between the different WMR headsets is comfort and build quality.

Anyway, great video, as usual. I'm also interested in running non-vr games in vr, and I'm really curious what your experience with vorpx has been like. It seems like a pretty bizarre piece of software, supposedly with a single developer but with a professionally styled (circa 10 or so years ago) website and no availability outside of that. It's also fairly expensive, and there doesn't seem to be any possibility of a refund if it happens not to work with whatever you're trying to get it to work with, so I'm nervous. Detailed impressions on the software and how usable it is are hard to come by, so I'd really appreciate it if you could find some way to go into detail about it.

-----I go on a rant here. Feel free to keep scrolling.-----

 As a game designer myself and having gone to a VR meetup once per month for about a year the progress and innovations that have been made is astounding. VR is not something that can be explained as simple as playing a game. It is an experience; to those who have not experienced or can not experience VR I am sorry, I am not sure how to put into words what it is like to experience it (especially when the VR works perfectly).
 For much of the negativity that see toward VR I have a bad metaphor for how I think VR is viewed: If you have never tasted green eggs and ham, but insist you do not like it nor could you sell it then try it. Green eggs and ham may have something for you. Vegetarian? Good news there is tofu green eggs and ham. It may even be cheaper, but you might have to jump through hoops currently to get it. However the industry of Green Eggs and Ham (trademark) may be on it's way to get cheaper and have more options for most everyone.",5,0,2018-09-09T20:28:02.000Z,StealthIntel,UCADbHfLup1YmhIxLwVe33jQ,pwgYgid6T6Q,True,Ugx9bIubaTikSnBxe2x4AaABAg

"Well, this has officially convinced me to buy a PSVR on eBay for the $100. I was planning on owning a Rift by now, but life happens and my finances got set back just enough to not make the PC upgrade necessary AND the headset viable both eligible for purchase. However, a $100 second-hand headset and a pair of $60 wands that I can probably get cheap second hand for a somewhat hacky but definitely usable experience seems well worth it to me.

EDIT: I've been reading a lot of comments and it seems like another great option, most likely even far better is a Windows Mixed Reality headset.

"Heads up for anyone more interested in VR stuff now, if you already have a decently capable PC and want a compromise between the price of PSVR and the tracking of the Vive, the Lenovo Explorer is a pretty decent choice. It's usually about $200 for the set with the controllers, but you can currently get the HMD alone for $99 at B&H. It's a Mixed Reality system, so SteamVR has official support for it. Not every game says it works with it, but as far as I know SteamVR can just force them to work regardless. The controller tracking isn't too far off from the PSVR's, but it only works when the controllers are in front of the headset, and if they can't, it'll just use the gyroscopes in them to guesstimate where they are.

"I prefer MGS's (and MGS3's) puzzle-like approach to stealth and level design.  It means that you as the player are responsable for what appears on screen.  Compare this to Splinter Cell (and it's later incarnations especially) that strip the player of agency in order to ensure the protagonist is badass.  Splinter Cell started the Press X to Awesome mechanic that has been the standard in gaming for two decades.  Sure, you creep under a tank or back behind a box and wait as guards pass by, but you the player are the one actively waiting.  Compare this to the darkness of Splinter Cell that garauntee success, levels built around one or two gimmick moves that you won't use anywhere else in the game, and a set-it-and-forget-it playstyle that has you watching Fisher's movements in game, waiting for him to complete his current action while you set up his next.  It's very much on rails, in a sense, less stealth than hot/cold (or the game hot lava you would play with your siblings as a kid), except hot is light and cold is dark.  Metal Gear made you responsable for Snakes actions fully.  So much so that the action pauses when you switch items, because when you are in game, it's all on you, and each moment counts.  Each button press to snap a neck counts, and the 'watching' is relegated to cut-scenes only.  Games these days are themsevles now movies.  You are a lone samurai against three foes, and, sure, you may press X to attack, but it's the character on the screen that perried, stepped up, then slashed down, all from that one controller tap, while you sit on the couch watching the choreography of the action.  In 1998, MGS was a game that really played like a game, and was all the better for it.",0,0,2018-09-08T08:36:57.000Z,Sean Jackson,UClHBTHDN-xFcYpGCJhFJLxA,zQx_VG4S2Vc,True,Ugz22d1P0m7L3C1sm7d4AaABAg

"I just recently finished MGS1 for the first time. I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised, this being my first proper go at a Metal Gear game (save for MGSV, but that just become confusing and exhausting story-wise). The first time I gave the Twin Snakes version a try, it felt kind of wonky and I didn't quite understand what I was meant to do. But with the original it slowly hit me: This game is more about creative puzzles than actual stealth. It was neat using claymores (after discovering by accident how to pick live ones up) to beat Raven in his pacman stage; or using the nikita launcher to beat Wolf. 

If there's anything I don't care for it's backtracking. I don't use a walkthrough unless I'm stumped for a bit, which would lead me back and forth across the map needlessly. I don't mind the exploration, but I'd prefer if they could keep objectives for your current goal in the same building.

"I think that the ending is boss looking into his own past, remembering his old self, 
The smashing of he window is him embracing his actual identity.

The clones and such are jargon made up by Miller and Ocelot to convince Ahab of his fake idenity.

 The first game is a game made by Xof to use as propaganda for smaller countries. 
The second game is a dream Ahab has about becoming the one, true boss, because of his faked memories of MGS3 snake eater.

The clones and such could also be him connecting up his remembrance of two bosses as clones, while inside of his coma, and all those characters are made up by Ahab.

One thing rings true in each game, the orginal motherbase was destroyed. That was OUTER HEAVEN, and the logo was him seeing Jack's past, the fog was his own past, and him moving into it is him trying to remember. The smirk is him seeing his own past clearing up after his comatose dreams, or fake memories are dissapating, and is him moving on.

"I still think that, though Paz was a figment of Snakes imagination, he created that situation out of guilt for not having saved her, and given Kojimas use of spirituality, I believe that Paz genuinely did return as a butterfly in order to say goodbye to Snake/paramedic, and put his guilt at ease, by showing she’s okay.

And the paramedic still shares the same guilt as Snake for Paz’s death, because he didn’t find the second bomb, which led to her death.

MGS4 was influenced negatively by Konami wanting to rein Kojima in creatively, and them shoehorning Ryan Payton to do so. Snake was pretty silent in that game, just like his dads double in this one.

"I'd just finished this amazing game 1 day ago and I can confirm that this is the most accurate review I ever watched in my life. You marked every point that I hated in this game (for not being really a a classic stealth game, hard to aim, hard to avoid enemies, level designs that likes to mess with you, really not fun to play objectives when you need to go back for searching cards or weapons to make you able to proceed in the game, that f*cking 30 floors challenge, and much more). Don't get me wrong, I really want to play the full franchise now but the fun fact is that I originally started playing this game by night just for chill and relax (I thought it was a stealth game with many cinematics, I didn't knew the missions/parts between the cinematics were so hard, frustrating and not really stealthy at all) I'd chosen the wrong game xD",0,0,2018-09-02T00:15:52.000Z,AX System,UCjWJplzJUG8GN7tMS8oUOtg,1ljAHf4zGQs,True,Ugy8HO3MTEwSblYGXbR4AaABAg

This review is pretty solid but I do disagree with some points. Mostly the shortcuts are meant to practice against a boss or memorize the more common rooms on a floor. This being a heavily RNG based game has its pros and cons. Pros mainly being every run is fresh and original with new items. Cons being that bad RNG or rare health and ammo in shops or spawns can dwindle a run in the beginning floors seemed as  a winning run.

"Unless you've extensively played previous monster hunter titles, you have no right to say any of what you covered in this video. This game has more than it's fair share of downsides that MH veterans  -or people with an actual sense of scrutiny- can see. 

First off, the monster A.I cheats. Whether the wyvernsfire of my gunlance has recharged, or I finally charge my blade and shield, or my special ammo has reloaded, conveniently the monster suddenly bolts, or lets out a roar that flinches you and runs away. It's happened more than enough times to me that it's too big a coincidence. So the only deduction is the A.I CHEATS. You'd know this if you played previous iterations.

Second, the hit detection and hitboxes on monster attacks are still, after years of releases, still horrible. And CapCom refuses to fix it, despite having the resources to do it.

These are just a few things that are more commonly criticized, but there's definitely more, if you had the know-how to look for it...",1,0,2018-08-31T23:40:19.000Z,RAGE AGAINST THE WORLD,UChgx7HGDbV91QOJ3V4WngLA,88_4E4RsO58,True,Ugz2f4qYr3W7Yp2BCEZ4AaABAg

"Enjoyed the video a lot.  I will say that it was definitely Peace Walker that changed the core game mechanic of tranquilizer head shots though.  Before this game, there was no need to engage a soldier of any kind unless you just wanted to in order to have fun.  All that mattered was that they didn't see you and raise the alarm.  The soldiers in the Pre-Peace Walker games were as safe around me as a sleeping child, simply a knock on one side of a surface and a switch around or have them investigate a tossed item and they never even knew I was there.  However, with Peace Walker's base building mechanic and the absolute requirement to recruit enemy soldiers into your rank via force, well... that peacefulness turned into, ""sorry, but you're going to have to come with me.""

"Personally,  I found Kojima's anti-American message to be too much in TPP. Its like a 14 year-olds conspiracy theories and they even had to warp history just to maintain that sentiment.

What I loved about prior MGS games was that there was no moral black and white. America wasn't wholly good or wholly bad, and in TPP they ruined Snake's descent into villainy by getting confused as to who the bad guys were really meant to be.

If America was as bad as GZ and TPP makes it out to be, then snake would be almost wholly justified in his actions and that's what makes it hard to embrace as good storytelling. At least in MGS3 the US and USSR were both morally ambiguous.  They missed a massive plot point in almost completely ignoring the Soviets role in Afghanistan and it hurt the immersion.

"The cynic in me says we can ignore practically everything you said and just acknowledge Nintendo is charging you exorbitant prices for cardboard boxes and the stupid gimmick of educational games. Games can teach you useful skills but trying to target those skills  to a productive life is hopeless. Does giving your kid a bunch of Legos mean they'll be a gifted architect? Does putting them on every local sports team mean they'll be a career athlete? Does buying them a PC mean they'll be a software engineer? So by what metric do you measure an educational game as good compared to a regular game?

I'm sorry if the way it was implemented made you experience the game this way, but honestly I can't grasp why you would. I think you could have benefited from taking a step back and looking at the design independent from your experience.

THEN after goofing around in tri for many hours and giving up, Tri U came out and I actually started to understand the game's minute to minute combat intricacies. I beat most of high rank on that one, and then from MH4U to MHGen to MHW I've played much more and gotten farther and farther in understanding with each game.

"Spec Ops: The Line wasn't about war, it was about PTSD. Everyone point at ""The Gate"" scene, but that scene practically mocks you with the line ""Sometimes you don't have a choice"", as you  reach the one point in the game where you're not even given the illusion of getting multiple choices (which inevitably lead to the same result).
To me, I'd say the most meaningful point in the game is when you ""meet"" the enemy commander. The real big reveal, when the big antagonist turns out to be nothing more than the main character's scapegoat.

So the game does well by making it easy for you to kill hundreds upon hundreds of enemies in a spectacular way, with little to no remorse. Because it helps emphasize the dissonance of a soldier who believed he was coming to save people, but ended up dooming them.
And the final choice, where you choose if to go home knowing everything you did, or to go down in a blaze of glory, really pushes the message.

It's not about what war does to civilians caught in the crossfire. It's about the psychological toll it has on a soldier.

"As someone who had never played any Metal Gear Solid games until V, this game was amazing. The story told so much emotionally without burying it in convoluted plot points that become increasingly hard to follow. I would say that Metal Gear Solid V is the average man's Metal Gear game. All the people who praise it were people who weren't intimately familiar and thus not accustomed to the style/tone of the original Metal Gear games. The only people I can find who disliked Metal Gear Solid V or have much criticism for it at all are the hardcore Metal Gear nerds. I think a lot of it stems from the fact that V was a departure from a lot of what made the series inaccessible to average people and the fact that the hardcore fans had such sky high expectations that I'm not sure any plot could have satisfied them. Being the filthy casual I am, Metal Gear Solid V is one of my favorite games of all time for not just gameplay, but plot as well.

"When I played Morrowind I didn't think of main or side quests, writing or characters, my objective was to gather allies, power and artifacts before facing the ancient evil. I traveled with a singular purpose, not checking boxes in my quest log on the way to my next quest hub. I dared caves and catacombs because I was interested if they were inhabited by monsters or people. I felt immersed.

Now I don't know if it came with age or 700+ hours of play but I started noticing things in Skyrim way before that mark. After the luster faded I could hear every quirk in voice acting, every lazy/rushed line of dialogue, that sometimes felt out of place, even unnatural. I kept finding myself thinking that I'm doing menial tasks that amount to nothing but useless steel greatswords of blazing (excelent reward for a mage) and gold bags as big as wedding dowries that I have no use for but to buy my 5th house I'll check out once and never come back again. I felt divided, indecisive, thinking for myself more than for my character.

The blatant fake urgency in the main quest I didn't notice before this video, I have to admit, but you might also find this problem in another game you might've heard of - Fallout 4. The immediate background story is already made for you to act on, and when you put yourself in the characters shoes wouldn't the objective take precedence over everything else except water, food and sleep? I felt constant nagging in the back of my head reminding me that I'm supposed to care about the main quest, that I'm supposed to get my shit together and go do what the writers intended me to do.

So I finally did... at level 40. I was left with such a bad taste in my mouth that I can't look at Fallout 4 anymore, hadn't touched it since. Thank the nine I did not notice this problem in Skyrim because I did love it to bits and still think those 700+ hours were not a waste of time. The 150 I invested in Fallout 4? I'm not sure.

"By the way, I may have a theory behind why no one ever really recommends you start with the 1st game in this franchise, but always tells you to go for the ""newest"" one.

Since I've played 2nd Portable G (Freedome Unite), 3U, 4U, some Generations, and World, I feel I can comfortably say it's because Monster Hunter is mostly a systems-driven gaming experience, and every newer MH game is an improvement on the basic game system, gameplay loop, and franchise content (i.e. new weapons and monsters, verticality, jumping mechanics, etc.). None of the individual narratives in each game are tied to each other; there is no narrative attachment between games. That means each new MH game is a fresh, new, clean slate, which encourages you to reengage with the franchise as if you're trying it out for the first time. That, much like the Pokemon games, may be one of the franchise's greatest psychological selling points - that each game is its own experience, and you are free to engage with each portal without baggage.

Consider BioWare's games by comparison, like the Mass Effect trilogy. BioWare's biggest franchises thrive on continuity porn, which gives each franchise's worlds incredible richness and depth as stories, but players are only able to appreciate the full scale and scope of the stories by playing each game in order. (PS3 ME3's my first Mass Effect game, but I never really appreciated the franchise nor ME3 itself until I purchased PS3 Mass Effect 2, then linked that save file onto a new ME3 playthrough.) Feeling like you need to go backwards in time to appreciate the legacy of a game franchise in full can be daunting, and it can be difficult if the means to do that aren't available (PS3 Mass Effect 1 came out well after I was done with the franchise, unfortunately). I think this is why people tend to talk about getting into a game lineage in story-chronological order, but never Monster Hunter.",1,0,2018-08-17T07:05:45.000Z,ZM Dumpbox,UChFzypWuxOCn74VkIHgc2Hw,88_4E4RsO58,True,UgwNvsghreAj1X6BJ154AaABAg

"Animal collecting was Konami's way of adding player interactivity to the wildlife. Plenty of games feature A.I. animals and include ways for the player to do more with them than just have them be a part of immersion in the scenery.

Games like FarCry and Red Dead Redemption gave the player a hunting/skinning mechanic that could be used for upgrades. Breath Of The Wild allows the player to use various quadrupedal animals as mounts in addition to just horses. Those are just 2 arbitrary examples, but there's many more.

I get what you're saying; It requires so much additional effort for a lack of reward. I feel like Konami added the conservation platform and the rescue/capture mechanic to give the animals an additional purpose; provide the player a tangible reason to interact with the various animals the developers modeled and programmed, rather than simply have them there just as 'window-dressing', so to speak.",0,0,2018-08-16T20:57:31.000Z,MC Apophis,UCtngtSFRbG_1u9JiV06H9dQ,hbVepJ5DbAI,True,Ugw3Deai7egagiYfGSh4AaABAg

"So it's the best game you've ever played when you're out on a hunt, 
but the worst thing you've suffered through when navigating the menus.

Yeah, I agree. My biggest gripe is how long it takes to do anything.

If I wanna see how many Jagras buttcheeks I need for that snazzy new weapon, you need to walk from the entrance, take a lift or open your friggin map, mash through 3 to 6 lines of pointless text, wait for the menu to load THEN select upgrade, choose the weapon i want, and SCROLL through the item tree to the upgrade I want.

Capcom KNEW how often you'd be stopping by the Resource Centre, the Farm, the Canteen, the Smithy (You'll be here a lot), So WHY are they so far apart?! In 4 Ultimate, Val Harbour was a hallway. Shops and upgrades on the left, Quest board and Canteen on the right. To get to the Quest gate from the Quest Board you have to walk straight past the canteen. You barely have to stop to eat, it happens so quick! If I take a quest at the Quest board near the entrance of Astera, by the time it loads I've restocked my item pouch and barely made it to Ecological Research, let alone the Canteen 3 stories up!",0,1,2018-08-16T09:00:50.000Z,Elzipper 7,UCxd3tL9qLGEAIlz1e48GOXQ,88_4E4RsO58,True,UgzgIdF1Wx2wKWQnY994AaABAg

"Eh, Super Bunnyhop just basically described in his praise exactly what turns me off about this game. Spending around 30 minutes slowly chipping away at a monsters health is not my idea of fun. The alternative is to hunt with other players, at which point the game just kind of devolves into a gankfest with very little in the way of strategy or tactics involved. 

MH World was my first try at the series. I sunk around 40 hours into it, got progressively better, learned to use the environment to my advantage, became proficient in a variety of weapon types, became familiar enough with monsters behaviors that I knew when and when not to strike, etc. But I eventually stopped playing when I realized I just plain wasn't having any fun. 

Objectively Monster Hunter: World is a good game. REALLY good, in fact. It has a series of goals it wants to accomplish as a game and it accomplishes them beautifully. Subjectively, though?

"I feel that you have to have the right mindset to really get into it. For about a month or two after I got it, I was obsessed with it.
Then I got bored, because it didn't feel like my character was developing.
It's because leveling up is directly tied to the type of loot you have. So sure, you can try to take down the Nergigante with low-tier items, but good luck doing it. Especially alone.
It relies on you grinding and grinding in order to craft weapons and armor so you can kill ""The Big Monster"", but in many cases it's a LOT of grinding. Killing the same creatures over and over again. 10 minutes, 10 minutes, 10 minutes, and you're no where close to building the doom weapon.
I appreciate the weapon choices, as they add variety. The insect glaive is really useful, even as a support tool. I also LOVE the Charge Blade, as it offers a different playstyle. However, you're still fighting the same and/or reskinned monsters over and over again, throughout the game.
That's not very compelling for such a large game that relies on you killing said creatures.

"This game is incredibly frustrating at times, very fun once you get the hang of it though. The campaign is very difficult at first unless you save constantly and use the slow mo functiom constantly. Got all the way thru the first campaign only to run out of time on the last turn.

 Constantly use cover air support and artillery if you have it. You wind up often outnumbered but if you bombard and ambush at the same time you wind uo with very few casualties. 

Infantry is best used in cities. Forests are great for recon units. You must have recon to spot for the bombardment. Tanks must be used behind infantry and or as far away from the enemy  as possible. Anti tank missles from infantry are usually only effective at shorter ranges. 

The AI isnt amazing so you can usually lure them toward the inside of a city full of infantry and  light them up with all the artillery and air power you can whild being of enemy anti air missiles, the evac function is a must if you air is in danger.

Theres a ton of little shit you learn and the best way to do so in my opinion is by watching other people play it that know what theyre are doing. I gaurantee you will do better by watching others otherwise you will be very very frustratrd. Very rewarding game overall when you get better.

"The story is good in one fell swoop, if you watch it like a movie it tells a pretty good story. It also was trying to conform to all the existing story and plot twists are kind of impossible when you essentially know what eventually happens. It's not the best, but it definitely has it's moments. I'll admit I can see through fan service pretty easily and thus I was able to easily see Quiet as being one of the best characters in the game. You can also see the groundwork for why Venom will hate Naked in the future, between the seed of doubt planted by him burning Quiet, putting him in the crosshairs of Cipher to save his own skin, and finally the fact that Naked chose to tell him of this plan after he had finished building up Diamond Dogs. Story wise it did what it had to, had it's own twists, and was serviceable.

The gameplay is the best in the series, by a landslide. It brings the stealth, action, and storytelling of Metal Gear to everybody, you can play through most of the story driving a tank if you want. Are there problems? Yes, from a permanent ""punishment"" for using lethal tactics, an online mode that is definitely spending a lot of it's effort to pursue microtransactions, to a lack of clarity on when the game ""ends"" are the side missions terrible? Yes, is the game too limited on placing them on the map? Yes. 

The problem I get is the extremes on this argument, this is undoubtedly one of the best metal gear games to date, considering the conditions it was produced under it's a small miracle we got what we did from it. Is it perfect? Hell no, is it bad, even more NO. The game has it's problems, the story ends early and was ultimately trying to wrap up a series that's ""Kojima'd"" up. Honestly, it's a good game, the reviews were Konami'd due to the review copy removing a ton of grinding, and disabled a most of the side missions, sure, but the game itself stands on it's own and being reviewed as a ""perfect"" is wrong, sure, but it's still a ""9"" if you will.",0,0,2018-08-14T02:31:39.000Z,Sherrif,UC4-bBswsLnGIVPRK-opByyg,KO4Tusk_V2k,True,UgyQC_ZW0cMDwZVRgYF4AaABAg

"sonic adventure 2 battle for the gc was the best sonic game ever made bar none, not only because of the level design, and the fast paced level design at the end of sonic's & shadow's arcs were amazing, but the very clever mechanics of the other characters, 

the main point though, was both the system where you needed to upgrade your character to unlock secret areas or hidden non-essential items, it gave the game a beautiful in in-depth rpg feel to it, not to mention the main reason for replayability for me - for me at least

was the Chao mini games, the Chao training, the Chao breeding system, the secret heaven and hell gardens in Chao world, and the plethora or depth it rewarded you with, along with being able to modify your chaos end stat points by deciding what type of animals you would feed to it, it was beautiful,

The gameplay is extremely polished, when you hit that super duper ultra combo you've been waiting for it feels buttery smooth, you feel the power of each hit getting you closer to the end of the hunt

"It took me a while to figure out that the radial menu settings were tied to the item loadout too. I understand why they did it in that way, but it was more trouble than the good it brought.

By the way, I didn't had to complains about menus and the mechanics because it opened progressively over the course of the single player campaign, letting us get confortable with each one before opening a new one.

What I still cursed today would be :
- The fact that each facility you need when going back from a mission is scattered in the village. Sure it makes it look realistic, but ... fuck that. You're coming back from a mission, you want to see what new things you can craft now ... up you go to the workshop ... at the opposite side of where you spawn. And don't forget to go to the garden where you grow plants, or check with the palico in your room for the safari, etc ... At least let us teleport when we want in the village. The elevator that works kind of like it isn't even located near where you spawn.

- The second one, which isn't such a issue on PC from what I heard, is the loading times ... oh gosh it took me some patience. They were awful AND why did they bloody need to put some features exclusively in your room (safari, palico equipment) where it needs a loading for entering and leaving.",1,0,2018-08-11T23:13:52.000Z,Schadows77,UCc8T2a86CzF4FCRZ7jpobww,88_4E4RsO58,True,UgyFz1UZM-sojUviA854AaABAg

"I think ff15 had what mgs pp should have had.
In ff15 you can camp to restore health and make meals to get certain bonuses. To make meal, You need ingredients you can get by fishing, hunting or picking veggies. Monsters are more aggressive at night, so resting was unnecessary battles.
Mgs3 had this concept. If they added camping in PP, the open world would have made more sense and would have been more fun. Gathering food, healing wounds, protect ourself against predators and soldiers. Also, Air supplying would have been more useful too.
And more importantly : Less helicopter.

The story felt incomplete but the directing was really good. The introduction mission and the infection mission were intense. The mission in the hospital almost felt like a horror game. The bosses had no story but their mise-en-scène were really well made.
Just feels the game was an explanation for why big boss is respawning everywhere. Or maybe a Sadam Hussein reference.
Quiet was a cringy and unnecessary pin up character. I won't say I didn't look at her, but her parts felt really awkward. Like one of those ""date a cute cavegirl"" type of stories. Well, her snipping skill was useful.
Beside, Still don't know if Huey was lying, misunderstood or used by big boss. Since you-know-who is not who we thought.

"Took a trip to Japan in June, and we randomly found Space Station. It was great, one of the best times I’ve had in a bar in ages.

It’s sad to hear that shortly after everything was shut down, I had no clue. I recall talking to Matt about how the idea came in place, and how he opened it. With my North American mindset I was dumbfounded that it was so simple. Essentially the way things work there is “You wanna start a business? Okay, just open it.” So to hear they now need various licenses due to copyrights is sad, and the primary attraction is unplayable, unless they cough up a $20 000 fee.

"Agree the can't view cut-scene together with friend is dumb, but I think Capcom said they wanted you to try it solo first before calling for help and SOS, as Solo is a learning experience first time. You can go to any place in town using your map lol. And the item loadout/radial menu, is good and bad, I know is ""meh"" if you not used to it, but imagine switching between Bow to Bowgun to Melee, it saves you the trouble to set a radial menu everytime you change your weapon, instead you just choose the load out. You could say they should've put radial menu to equipment load out, but then again, for bow/bowgun, each bow/bowgun might have different ammo/crafting item you need that are different, so binding the radial menu to equipment loadout might not be best, instead binding to item loadout make more sense.

"You seem to lack the understanding to constantly sharpen your weapon. And to add to that, you ignored the fact that there are SOS flares in the game which allow for instant online partners to join. 

The menus can be a bit much, and the way they almost force you to do the singleplayer/campaign mostly solo, is a bit odd indeed. But do not forget that solo is the way to dominate. Stun, sleep, para, poison,... all have resistances, playing solo makes it way easier to KO monsters with the hammer. And its in MHW that they really amped up these stun/sleep resistances as soon as someone joins you in a fight.

And please, sharpen!

"""Many of these weapons have their own meter management thing going on"" as he looks at the moves for the Lance, the only one that has literally no minigames. :P You just poke and block, block and poke, poke a bit higher, then block harder and counter with a harder poke. 

Not to say it isn't great, if you want to be the immovable object, pick the lance. The simplicity means you get to focus on fighting, the precision means you get to learn their weakspots, and the block means you get to learn monster movesets safely. And when you encounter the really big bad, you are the only class that won't get oneshot by his kill move, but can also immediately turn around to bring the pain during his recovery. Attack relentlessly, but weave blocks into your attacks so you never break that chain. You may not be flashy, but you are both immovable and unstoppable. Did I forget to mention you can do a lance charge?

Really thinking about it, I could probably write a whole paragraph on why every weapon is great, and that is something you rarely get in a game. Best advice is if you aren't liking your current weapon then change it up. There are two types of people in this world: those who like Monster Hunter and those who gave up before finding their weapon of choice.

On a final note: The Horn is not a support weapon. You best remember that. The followers of Dooteronomy do not take kindly to that poor classification of their beat stick.",13,0,2018-08-11T03:00:47.000Z,Draconic74,UCv8OBxYE5lCSNTvKYfvdzZw,88_4E4RsO58,True,Ugz5ec4zO2XODVYW0Sh4AaABAg

"I'm a ""trophy hunter"", I have this OCD thet forces me to try and get the platinum of most the games I buy (as long as they're reasonable). I left this game shortly after buying it because it seemed repetitive as fuck, the story was non-existent and the characters were boring. Recently, I thought ""Hey, you've completed the first Assassin's Creed several times and that shit was repetitive, why don't you give MGSV a second chance"" and so I did, partly because I was bored and because the trophies didn't seem to be too hard to get.

I resisted until the mission where you capture Liquid. Rescuing prisoner 42, extracting soldier 76, destroying armored vehicle 153 can only be entertaining for a while and I've had enough. When in Afganistan, wanting to see Angola made me continue playing but now that I've sen the two maps I'm just bored of sneaking into the same fucking places again and again and again. If I have to get into Nova Braga Airport once more I'll lose my shit.

There is also the fucking soldier extracting thing. A lot of time I was doing the mission just right but I saw an A++ or S soldier and going after him got me discovered. Yes, it is my fault for getting caught but the whole thing is just another fucking grind! It's not like you can extract a coouple of dozens soldiers and forget about it you have to spend the whole fucking game doing the same shit if you want to get your MB to the max level. At the end I was more occupied capturing soldiers than doing the damn missions.

This game could've been soooo good if they sticked to the formula of the other games in the series making a linear map with different environments a kickass story and memorable characters because the mechanics are perfect but they had to go with the trend of 2015 and make it *OPEN WORLD! HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF CONTENT! NUMEROUS SIDE QUESTS!*

And I've 100% completed games like GTA IV and V, World at War, Dark Souls 1 and 3, Bloodborne... In GTA the boring checklist was just the hidden packages, in World at War the grenades were annoying and the Soulborne games had some frustrating bosses but In MGSV the challenge is going through the game without sucumbing to the voice in your head that says ""Why are you doing this? You're not having fun"" because in MGSV the whole game is literally the checklist. My OCD trophy hunter dissorder is not that severe. I'll leave it for a while and come back when I forget the maps.

"I agree with a lot of the points you raised. Perhaps the most baffling thing about World is the way Capcom have implemented the online features in this entry in the franchise. Somehow they managed to make them worse than the half dozen games that did it fine before this. On a console MUCH BETTER SUITED TO ONLINE PLAY, NO LESS. If they improve on any one thing in future games, let it be this. The multiplayer for Monster Hunter is so core to its identity, that having a good lobby system should be absolutely crucial to get right and World sadly flops in this regard.

The menus being a labyrinthine nightmare of obfuscation is irritating to be sure, but it's still worth mentioning that World has taken steps to improve accessibility for newcomers with how it presents information compared to previous games in the franchise, and that at least means it's a step closer to being easier to understand than what it used to be. 

And perhaps the best thing that can be said about Monster Hunter World... it's on a console with a controller that wasn't designed for gremlins with broken hands like the 3DS was. It cannot be understated how much of a huge improvement this is to the series. So many long sessions of Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on the PSP or Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate on the 3DS with friends were cut short due to hand cramping and pain from having to contort my fingers into the control scheme that worked best. Having a controller with more than 1 analogue stick and more thought put into ergonomics than none at all? It's a gamechanger for me and I don't think I could go back having experienced it again.

Honestly this game is incredible. As someone who's stuck with Monster Hunter from the beginning, it's genuinely brought joy to my heart seeing new people finally dive into this series and experience it for the first time. I can only hope Capcom continues to improve on the formula as they move forward on this new generation.",0,0,2018-08-10T21:08:47.000Z,Skeleton-chan,UCeO1tt48MoZdNQAXkoTDOKg,88_4E4RsO58,True,Ugy0bHB70NqRmmpYW8F4AaABAg

"Everybody complains about the menus and UI, but I'm really surprised that I don't see more complaints about the *mission time limit*. This is a game that is supposed to be very deliberate and cerebral, that is supposed to reward you for careful observation, and planning, and stalking your prey, and setting traps, and leading the monsters into those traps. But then there's a 60-minute time limit that is (as far as I'm concerned) completely antithetical to all of those design philosophies.
http://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2018/05/11/Monster-Hunter-World-game-review.aspx

This time limit is either a hold-over from previous games, or it's a band-aid to fix other major design flaws in how enemies and resources spawn and re-spawn. Or it's a cheap trick to try to force the player into needing to grind the side quests to get the better elemental weapons because you simply don't have enough time to whiddle down a monster's HP with an undrepowered weapon. There are better ways to accomplish those goals, however, but Monster Hunter just picked the laziest, easiest, most artificially-gamey method that they could, where you could have the monster at 1 HP remaining, about to get the killing blow, and then the timer ticks down to zero, and it's ""mission failed"", ""quest over"", back to base (through multiple load screens).

If that time limit weren't there, I think I would have loved this game, since I would have actually had the time to experiment with different tools and tactics, without having to accept that I was just going to be flushing my time and resources down the toilet by doing so.",0,0,2018-08-10T20:00:20.000Z,MegaBearsFan,UC8yW3eK4meyI7IwMrUM-WiQ,88_4E4RsO58,True,Ugzg9VLhHzooVrQ0WtV4AaABAg

"My only experience with MH was through MH-3, and it went like this: ""oh, okay, weapon tutorial. Neat. Okay. so I get targets, kill them, collect the stuff, and complete the mission? Neat. Oh look, herbs...Do they expect me to pick up all of these...? Did I seriously pay to play a solo-MMORPG? Oh look, more herbs...And more monsters to just chase and slice...More herbs...oh look, ores. This isn't fun.""
And, honestly, everything Bunny was talking about did not tell me why I'd think MH-World would be any different, in terms of gameplay that isn't bland and sterile. Yeah, dynamic combat and whatever, but that doesn't transform gameplay, it adds on top of it. And if one thinks the base gameplay isn't fun, there aren't any additions in the world that'd change that. And tbh, what he referred to as ""cerebral gameplay"", to me, sounded more like: ""Being forced to make a shit ton of meta-preparations combing through an enormous inventory. Wow, that's super fun.""

MH will give to you what you put into it, it rewards knowledge, learning and patience. To me not even the Souls series comes CLOSE to being as gratifying.",1,0,2018-08-10T10:01:25.000Z,Womwur,UCY4xXxl1sXAzTQIpYxto3EQ,88_4E4RsO58,True,Ugx4AUhDzZWTuO1o_oZ4AaABAg

"Great video George! As someone who started playing on consoles though I want to throw out there  the element of this game that straight up killed my enjoyment and caused me to give up on it, because given your specific circumstances playing prior to and around release (and seemingly having a group of people you were aiming to co-op with), I don't think this would have been an issue that presented itself to you, at least so far.

It stems from how World's implementation of single player versus multiplayer works, and given how long it's been the case on the PS4 version (much like the roadblocks in story co-op) I don't think it's ever going to be changed. Basically multiplayer seems to be handled as though they hit a switch, with solo being balanced for one player and any other number scaling up in the same fashion regardless of player count. The number being thrown around is a 2.6x increase to monster health and since I'm a very particular breed of misanthrope, I only ever had an interest in playing MHW with one particular friend of mine.

What this meant is that as the game was a fun, albeit slower than intended romp initially but as monsters got tougher playing with just one other person became like banging my head against a brick wall, only the wall WOULD RUN AWAY AND NOW I'VE GOT TO SPEND 5 MINUTES CHASING THE WALL SO I CAN INEFFECTUALLY BANG MY HEAD AGAINST IT SOME MORE. What this ultimately led to was a point in the story where regardless of the tactics we used, my friend and I couldn't beat a monster without the game simply timing out and the hunt failing. I understand the AI Palicos are supposed to be a solution to this issue, but those furry little fellows seem to achieve next to nothing in practice.

We hit that point after 80 hours or so of playing, although it had become far less enjoyable than it started out way before we were close to that amount of playtime. It sucks because it feels like it'd be such an easy fix to have those health values scale based on the amount of players actually in the session. I can only assume since it hasn't been acknowledged at all it isn't something the larger community really cares about, but it certainly spoiled it for me.

Anyway, awesome work as always. I'm a long-time viewer, and I appreciate what you do. Keep it up man!",1,3,2018-08-10T09:34:01.000Z,Lux Noctis Gaming,UCzH35UChEqQF5Lq2NGCET2Q,88_4E4RsO58,True,Ugz9dDuDlaAxcY8DuBB4AaABAg

"My friends were getting super into this game and I spent around 20 playing it so I could enjoy it with them. Sadly I couldnt play the game without falling asleep or constantly wanting to play a different game. I respect your opinion and I'm glad you have fun with it but I think the game is extremely mediocre. I cant go into super detail on all of the problems I had with it, but when it comes to your video I feel like you focused on the wrong things. 

 A good chunk of the video criticized the menu, matchmaking system, and harsh barriers for new players. 

 I agree the matchmaking is one of the worst systems I've dealt with for online play. Which is a shame considering how terrible the game is solo. Fortunately i usually played with my friends and we got use to the online session system so I had a fine time with it.

 The most detail you gave in this video was about the menus. Although I agree they suck, you made it seem like it was the biggest problem the game had for some reason. I honestly think you were doing this to spend more time talking about how bad the game is and make the video seem more impartial after worshipping the gameplay and environment.

 I do agree on the barrier thing to a certain extent. The devs make these game assuming players will play online with friends or will use the internet to figure shit out so they can get away with being lazy tutorial wise. It does a good job explaining the basic mechanics of fighting and navigating the shitty hub. I'm fine with this because the game isnt that complicated, it just has a lot of bullshit going on. Any player who cant figure this game out is a lazy learner or wont take advantage of the internet/their peers. Its an active choice to learn a game and to be honest I'm tired of games being judged on how ""accessible"" they are. 

 Dont take my opinion too seriously tho as I am just some random gamer commenting on youtube. And your comment about this game being the cod of Japan made me actually laugh out loud.

i feel no sense of accomplishment when i finally beat them especially cause its just one of the many to come i wanna be able to hurry up and get back to the fun mechanics of a game maybe if i could one shot this things i would like this game but this and dark souls and any other game like it thats all bull sponge long winded enemies is no fun too me maybe if it was because the AI was so smart thats why it was hard but its not they are designed to be that way so wheres the accomplishment in just going along with something u cant skip to the end up thats why i love open worlds i can do what i want but man i wanna like these games but its those long as boss fights that just kill it for me just my opinion!",0,1,2018-08-10T02:15:49.000Z,Kryptik Komatose,UCWb9VSZjd3jumzcJvUjxLcw,88_4E4RsO58,True,UgxlvMOuDQtoTvp84qx4AaABAg

"A few corrections:
1) You can do every single story assignment (mission) with friends or randoms even. What you can't do is start those assignments with them. You must first watch a cutscene. Only then can your firends join.You can fire a SOS Signal which will allow randoms from other Online Sessions to join your quest. (It's pretty dumb I know)
2) You can easily access the Training Area by choosing it on the map.
3) Radial Menus are tied to Item sets because that way, you can have a Radial menu that gives you quick access to the items you may bring with you when you play with a Bowgun, which would be different than the items you would bring as a support player, which would also be different than the items you would bring as a melee player (you get the point).

That is to say, of course all of these systems could have been implemented in a better way.

"My views:

Episodic Release
There are pros and cons here. The missions are generally a lot more expansive and sandbox-ish when compared to previous titles. Having an episodic release at regular intervals would allow players the time to fully explore and appreciate the full extent of each map. However, not all players can accept this payout method. Previous titles had multiple maps and missions to experiment with, though arguably with much less detail and sophistication. Having only one main map (Paris) to explore at the game's release can make the game rather stale after a few runs. That said, it can also be argued that episodic release prevents the game from becoming too overwhelming and simultaneously squeezed dry too early, considering that it is a lot more ambitious in terms of scale.
They tried to keep it fresh through Contracts mode, as well as the new Elusive Targets mode, which gave the maps a twist, with the former aiding the community in learning as much as they can about the map throughout its launch month, and the latter bringing in some impetus to these already ""completed"" maps as new missions were released. The initial non-replayability of the elusive targets is a source of contention, but I'd argue that it served as an added bonus and agency to its completion, as well as a reward for the early adopters.

ONLINE ONLY
The incompatibility between online and offline saves; and mastery/challenge unlocks being disabled in offline mode is something that has irked many. Yet, the main bone to pick is with the resetting of run progress when booted off the server, through no fault (maybe) of the players' own. It ain't ideal, and the autosave system can be tweaked to help mitigate such losses, but that is a letdown on the technical aspect, not one of gameplay. The unlocks being made unavailable in offline mode is actually a funny point IMO, since the offline mode is more reminiscent of the previous titles where players had very limited item choices and starting locations. You can still play the game offline, just without the additions to the formula that 2016 has introduced. Separation of online and offline saves help to reduce the impact of game mods/hacks; and is not really a frequent occurrence, so I'd let the point slide unless there is vehement opposition.

The main missions were great, not perfect, but sufficient enough for me to enjoy. The bonus missions were kind of a waste of potential (I'm looking at you, The Icon), since only a few really gave the original maps something new and noteworthy to experiment with again, like A House Built On Sand and The Source. The Sapienza bonus missions wasted the best map in the whole game, Holiday Hoarders was largely skippable, The Vector while unique was highly restrictive due to its sniper only nature, and Patient Zero IMO wasn't as fun as Situs Inversus. Considering that these bonus missions were paid add-ons, I feel that this is the main gameplay shortcoming that I felt really shortchanged the game.

Here's to hoping that HITMAN 2 can improve on its predecessor and listen more closely to community feedback.",0,0,2018-08-08T16:25:09.000Z,Matt Ishida,UCpl9nBG1yfE3IXoiRzNOc7Q,yqAF2j_X-_c,True,UgyrxXywVabMQlb_6H94AaABAg

"I would like them to backtrack on the super fun tone and cringe references and dialogue. Watch Dogs 3 should enhance the controls and should balance the quips and jokes with actual consequences and real drama as well as comedy. As for the controls they should go full non lethal. The X, triangle and square buttons do nothing in the game so why not make them combat based like Batman Arkham or Sleeping Dogs with more Gadgets and melee/stealth than guns. As for a new setting, either London, Atlanta, Houston, Baltimore, Philly, or NY. Also control of other vehicles like helicopters and planes would be great. I also think the next hacking vigilante shouldn’t be wearing just a bandana like Aiden Pierce or Marcus Halloway, I want him to wear a mask and like jacket, boots, pants and gloves that go with the outfit selected for your hacker alter ego, then your citizen identity can be something to introduce with different gameplay and side stories. Like as a civilian you blend in during the day, but during the night you become your hacker identity. Both identities should be customizable with haircuts and new outfit unlocks. Next the new city should have the civilians sort of amped up from the last game, more random acts of violence and stuff, more gangs, more criminals, more civilian interactions and ones that can give you missions. Choose a new archetype of character, maybe instead of an African American or White dude, maybe a Muslim man, or a Hispanic woman, or a gay man. No more Dedsec, I want this new vigilante to fly solo and almost be an urban myth among both the hacker and criminal worlds. Maybe Blume isn’t the villain anymore, maybe a new company comes along that promises it will make a Smart City without the things Blume did and the main character has to uncover the truth (Including more detective work in the game). Bigger open world, bigger stakes and consequences. Maybe what you do effects the outcome of the city. Like you could potentially blow up a skyscraper full of civilians to take down the company or stop the company’s agenda with stealth and espionage. Oh yeah and dialogue options that show how supporting characters will think about you later. Also more buildings to be able to go in and more interactive environments. Like Hitman 2015. The side missions in Watch Dogs 2 were super entertaining but should be put to a higher scale. Like the shifter thing was fun maybe references towards Assassin’s Creed and aliens and shit would be fun side missions, as well as taking down the gangs of whichever city is chosen. A realistic display and control setting that changes how the cars drive based on environmental issues as well as like no warning when you are gonna get hit.",1,0,2018-08-07T17:20:27.000Z,John Delorenzo,UCu2puXlCbVhFu9fK9SUS-2Q,g0HX2_q7D1U,True,UgwJH9o4ykKgwH1bCat4AaABAg

"In Serbia we have a lot of internet cafes like those big bars  but with game consoles and arcades, the one I went most often too has been around for more than 12 years, but it has changed it location and a few times and it's no longer a bar, you can't drink anything. And from the beggining you have to pay just to play the consoles and it's timed. 
Anyway, it's a ton more illegal than this, they've had pirated games on all playstations they've had since the PS2, but if it weren't for my dad taking me there when I was 3 years old, I probably wouldn't have become a gamer at all. I loved playing the PS2 there, it was beautiful, they had an entire wall covered in ps2 covers so you can choose any game that seems interesting, that's how I found out about Persona and Disgaea, just by looking at a minimized copy of the cover(they even sold copies of their pirated games, but don't judge em too much, it's not like you could get PS2 games anywhere else outisde of downloading yourself, and back then almost everyone had really slow internet) ,eventually bought bought one, and when they got the PS3 I was really exited because I could save my game to the usb and stuff, but they had nowhere near the amount of ps2 games, I guess because of storage...

"What strikes me as bizarre here is that video game copyrights are given special treatment that doesn't seem to extend to other creative works (movies, books, etc.). Japanese artists _and_ businesses are notorious for widespread appropriation and repurposing of images from creative works; they have a huge, well-known convention (Comiket) dedicated solely to selling doujinshi, many of which are blatantly based on other copyrighted works. It's a pretty obvious double standard.

Video gaming happens to be one of the few world markets in which Japan is unquestionably preeminent, so that may have led them to make improper concessions to the industry due to overblown fears of losing that distinction. Hollywood certainly has a lot of clout here in the United States, and movies are to us what video games are to Japan in terms of prestige.

Remember when Shinzo Abe showed up at the 2016 Olympics wearing a Mario hat to advertise the 2020 games in Tokyo? That clearly shows how important Japan's government thinks Nintendo is, so they could hardly be neutral on an issue like this.

I can only hope that Japan's consumers ultimately realize how hypocritical this is and put pressure on the government to pass a more reasonable set of copyright regulations.

"I came back here because I saw you reviewed this and was interested in what you had to say, now that I have spend so much time with it, and the new update that adds a bunch of new stuff and makes the game easier in general, and it's interesting, I hate  to be the guy who says to get good, but it's actually kind of accurate here, because I also hated having to get the stuff for The Tinkerer, however I realize now that I never care to use him, especially because you are hurting yourself by not getting the Master Rounds early game if you want any chance of beating Bullet Hell, so I actually think new players should skip him completely and wait until they can beat Dragun on a majority of their playthroughs, especially since you don't want to actually use it when you can beat each chamber easily regardless. The game has so much content too that saying 20 hours is laughable, I don't have everything yet, I didn't before the update, and with the update there are so many new things to do, along with synergy weapons which add a whole new layer upon the game, as well as the super speed modes and much more.

"So you just gave me a mind blowing thought. The way that MGS breaks the 4th wall feels like it is clearly saying it's in a video game regardless of its narrative complexity or presentation. I had never considered this before.

Now in MGSV the story is almost universally seen as bad. I am not defending it. I think it was intentionally bad.

The previous games focus more heavily on narrative than gameplay, though they are still very well put together with lots of little details that can be easily overlooked. 

V shifted focus to the gameplay. We know this was an intentional design choice as Kojima wanted to make what he envisioned as the true physical representation of the world since it was able to be much more free form in nature and visual realism. 

The prior games emphasized the story in minute detail while V emphasizes the gameplay likewise. 

After 4 retconned several supernatural elements to be technological he decides to bring back 2 of the very few confirmed supernatural entities in Psycho Mantis and Colonel Volgin as the main boss enemies.

The story was almost entirely nonsense while being balanced with some extremely well done moments with unparalleled emotional impact. In direct contrast to how prior games were played mostly straight with that Kojima weirdness for balance. 

1 was about the story because the gameplay couldn't cut it. V directly contracts this by telling it's story in game and having most of the details entirely missable like prior games little gameplay touches. Because it was finally the gameplay he envisioned long after he had finished telling his story. 

So maybe V was so nonsensical on purpose.",0,0,2018-08-03T03:35:47.000Z,Zero Attention Gaming,UCeeFBzxg3RcGYctz9swXtow,zQx_VG4S2Vc,True,UgyP_FCeqI3Ic-Xwvp54AaABAg

"I'm probably a heretic to the internet by now, but I always say Sonic Heroes is a GREAT game. It sure has some flaws, namely when it devolves into a crude beat 'em up because some enemies have too much health (and outside that rails being wonky sometimes), but that's basicly the only real problems. The music is cool, it's fast, the camera is decent for once, and the levels are long and full of character. And if one wants a different gameplay than ""run from A to B"", play the Chaotix and do a variety of different missions from collecting items to guard duty. I frankly don't know why so many people hate this game.

Also, it's a testament to the failures of SEGA that Sonic Mania, a fangame which sadly came out after this video, blasted all those crappy official Sonic games out of the water with its scope and extremely high quality :/",1,0,2018-08-01T18:09:45.000Z,Katie R,UCL7mJjAUq32LyYfklDO2Cqg,-kE9BR24XIw,True,Ugw6-tOIeQRunNbFH1N4AaABAg

"i just went past the 15 hour mark and haven't yet beaten the game. i've made it to the 4th floor boss so far but the main problem is that it's just getting really repetitive. at first i really didn't like the game that much. while it has grown on me since then, i'm not sure if i stick around to finish it tbh... i'm mainly trying to hunt achievements now to keep my motivation going. 
my main problem is that there is really no progression except the chance of a new drop and doing all the quests is just really tedious. like the hunting challenge numbers are so inflated, i am no now at the blobulin challenge and i've been hunting them for about two hours and still have about half to go. and then there's 13 challenges more like this. this is just insane. just a big time sink. 

also i agree with the commenter who said the game is somehow fast, but slow at the same time. in nuclear throne for example it's my decision to play offensive or defensive. gungeon just traps you with a bunch of enemies in a room, sometimes for minutes at a time since some rooms have 3-4 waves of enemies. while you have a dodge roll the controls are slower and floatier, your projectiles also slower and hit detection is just better in nuclear throne. even tho there even enemy projectiles are faster moving than in gungeon, weaving through them works better because of that. in gungeon your whole character is the hitbox as far as it appeared to me so far. also most interactive things in the environment are pretty useless or super situational. unlike nuclear throne, where decisive mobility is often the best option, efficient play in gungeon from floor two on means to find hard cover, then dip out and spend minutes cleaning the room with your standard gun which is objectively the safest and best way to play if you don't want to take any damage at all and still have blanks and ammo left for the boss. 

the game makes you think that something of impact just happened whenever you rescue anyone out of a cell or when you bought or unlocked an item, but really nothing changes. you don't get stronger or a better starting loadout, and that's alright, but the guns you unlock usually aren't that better than standard tier guns, except when you are lucky to have synergies going, which is super rare. the rooms and enemies don't become more interesting, they just have way more health, spam more projectiles faster and there's more environmental hazards. 

one other thing nuclear throne did way better is enemy and projectile visibility. in gungeon it can happen that your shots can cover up enemy fire. when you spam the flame shotgun which requires to get close you won't see any incoming bullets in the front due to big projectile sprite of your own weapon. also melee in gungeon, while existent, is just not viable at all. in throne you can commit to a melee run and make it. you can beat most of the game with the wrench and it's a crazy rush. you can probably beat enter the gungeon with the standard gun, but that sounds rather tedious to me. 


tldr.: not a bad game, but i'm not sure i am having enough fun to stick with it until i have beaten it due to it being very repetitive and less kinaesthetically pleasing than nuclear throne imo.",0,2,2018-08-01T16:54:08.000Z,Bird Person,UCK3ZJeYD8urQEHmVatIwaQg,RSHoVQqF0vI,True,Ugw1nhgXOXMjjeRGwD14AaABAg

"The rerelease of the _Resident Evil REmake_ is really a remaster since it brought the game up to HD quality, so it should technically be called _Resident Evil REmake REmaster_ or something like that. But that isn't why I wanted to leave a comment on here though.

What I really wanted to say is that nostalgia is not a determining factor as to saying that _REmake_ was great. I've played it for the first time recently (both Chris and Jill campaigns) and I too see that it's one of the best horror games ever made, perhaps also the best in the series. I never played any of the classic titles with the exception of _CODE: Veronica X_ over a year ago and started the series at _Resident Evil 5_ and played almost all the main titles onwards including the _Revelations_ games, so this game was the closest I could get to playing the classic PS1-era games. The twists that Capcom did on the gameplay as well as some enhancements to its story made this game a must-play for every _RE_ fan and horror enthusiast alike. As for me since I'm almost done with the Jill campaign (I first started on the Chris campaign, lol), I am proud to say that it's one of my top five favorite horror games along with _Dino Crisis_ . Speaking of which, I hope Capcom remakes that game in the near future.",0,0,2018-07-27T19:25:53.000Z,Clayton Luce,UCQvbcLLucXmafIts_7cExLw,df_ET25Z-EQ,True,UgyFUETJF7ia4ftb4nF4AaABAg

It doesn't devalue your ability to quantify an idea to a point which makes you happy or not. This is the mentality kojima was forced to embrace in order finish  while dealing with konami's greed.

I tried fighting a river troll at level 4 with a bad destruction staff and *only* survived to get away because I quickly considered my options and summoned a rubbish familiar while jumping over rocks, then jumped off (fall damage nearly killed me again), the familiar being sacrificed and buying me that time.

Yes, ESO has a bad story and atmosphere, tries to make me the saviour of the world when everyone else is also the one true saviour.

"I normally really like your reviews but I can't agree with some of the stranger nitpicks in this one. The game felt quite unique in terms of art style and color, unless you lump all pixel art games together, which is what it felt like you did. The music fits the areas extremely well and the example you cited was actually one of the best, it's a bittersweet track to match a beautiful scene marred with some shocking imagery of its flayed former inhabitants. Its the contrast that makes that so great, after all, you don't see that gore until you pass the starting walkway. Almost all of the music in the game can be described with one word including that track - moody, and it's GREAT. The east path being the hardest is extremely subjective, with most people saying either east or north is easiest, the boss of the east in particular being by far the easiest, I'm fairly sure THAT at least is not subjective. And I really loved the looping, confounding layout of the east, it made me feel a little lost but not too lost, you know?

I'm completely with you on game feel and polish - they did come back to the game to partly remedy and greatly improve on some of this which is fantastic, but when it came out all your statements about how the game feels to control and the way it impacts your experience are spot on.

But the rest of the criticism felt thrown in to finish up and not up to your usual standard! Possibly because the game frustrated you and you wanted to be done with it (something I can actually sympathize with but still).

That said opinions are opinions and I still love your channel, keep at it :>",0,0,2018-07-22T20:33:30.000Z,Zayd,UCj7SudS3-icqUMFYmbOxgwg,OWFYccSCk0Y,True,UgwBOaLHCdxARSOlpOF4AaABAg

"This review is more subjective than a review should be and I could've easily discerned you don't play rougelites if you didn't say it. I do agree with your first problem with the game. The game was really hard with such low drop rates and even though they just recently changed it to be easier, it did take them a while. However, your second and third ones are what told me that you really haven't played rougelite. You blame the game because it isn't what your *idea* of what a rougelite is. Most rouglites don't have destructible walls, the two examples you gave are the only two notable rouglites that do that, and you don't need to peer into rooms beforehand. Shortcuts are not ""VITAL"". I have never once met a person who uses shortcuts more than a few times. You are supposed to unlock shortcuts after you have completely mastered a chamber. That's why it requires so many materials and requires you to no-hit the final boss. If you depend on shortcuts, you are rushing for them too fast. Also, ""You just walk into a room, shoot everything, rinse and repeat. Which, hey, works for what they are going for, but try doing it for 20 hours."" I *have*, in fact, tried it for 20 hours, and I find it very enjoyable. I have seen many play for much more than 50 hours and everyone I see that doesn't immediately dislike the game when they start playing it, play it for more than 20 hours.
You know what game doesn't have destructible walls, allow you to peer into rooms beforehand, shortcuts, but has very rinse and repeat gameplay?

"I think RE4 is a perfect example of brilliant pacing and level/enemy design. Though there are a lot of enemy encounters in the game, none of the encounters feel the same as they keep on building entirely new scenarios, there's always at least one twist, if not more than one or even a completely unique area or overhaul, to each other. And they know how to design interesting arenas and slowly introduce enemies and new variables as the game goes on. Building off what you know and the first time playing keeping you continually unsure of what to expect next.

I think that's one of the big areas where RE4 really shines in and why it works, even though it's a game where you fight a ton of enemies, it's not like other games of the same breed as the encounters all have their own life and feel different from each other. Which is impressive, as RE4 is also longer than the usual game of its type. And this is backed with great atmosphere and satisfying gunplay (and of course, the encounters are actually fun and the design is on point) and fantastic replay value.",4,0,2018-07-21T14:15:49.000Z,Evolved Cockroach,UCqihIaljQp5kMhjM8kdb4Og,urpHwgOujcw,True,UgxKb57e83Y7TdNIxcF4AaABAg

"One, I know this is a 3 year old video, but I want to clear a couple things up.

MGS V was a rushed project forced by konami to milk more money from the masses. There was ALOT of cut content, which is probably why there were only 2 chapters. Kojima probably wanted there to be 5 or 6 chapters, but Konami was hounding him to pump the game out to fill their wallets. He was basically fired halfway through the development of the game BECAUSE they didnt agree with him. There are alot of rough edges to MGS V because Kojima didnt get to influence the game entirely, the game was rushed, and on top of that he probably didnt even want to make the game to begin with. And if he did, it was probably supposed to be more extensive than this. Kojima wanted a full novel, where Konami just wanted a picture book, so Kojima had to cram as much of it as he could in a short amount of time.",0,0,2018-07-21T12:00:39.000Z,Archerzz239,UCj0pYXSCvis_fXJES1NXfTQ,KO4Tusk_V2k,True,UgwtzmWqNpl5kKf5sFp4AaABAg

"I adore all three of Supergiant's games, but I tend to play them through, binge them, and then...move on. Satisfied. Full. Content. And as such, I realize there is, as I suspected, SO MUCH depth and subtlety I am missing out on! Bastion is a bit more straight-forward, and Pyre is still new and I'm still working through my second playthrough, but Transistor is easily the MOST vague of the three, and it's the one I've been tasked with writing a prequel fic about -- as such, it has been MIND BLOWING to be looking into these theories, and suddenly making SENSE of all of this stuff that I knew had some plan behind it, some kind of design, I just never read into it. This is a great example of a story using mystery effectively because there IS substantial evidence, organically displayed, for those who want it.

As an example of having my mind blown, I now accept the idea that the entire tragic course of events of this game stem from Sybil's unrequited obsession with Red -- that if not for her selfish action, none of the game's events would've been set into motion the way they were. Just as the game CONCLUDES with an single-minded, selfish act of pursuing love, so does it begin. Despite being set in a cyberpunk world of 'what is reality, really?' it's ultimately about very human characters trying to pursue what they love, whether that's Red and ()Breach propping each other up, Sybil clinging to the idea of who she wants Red to be, Asher trying to support Grant, or Royce just plain pursuing the math of their reality to its culmination.

"I loved the first game (didn’t really like the later wave of sequels that were in the future or something), but the original Racket and Clank games were apart of my childhood, especially the first. I was excited when I heard they were making a reboot game and optimistic when I heard about the movie, but was very sad that it was just a generic third person shooter designed to sell merchandise and take advantage of people’s nostalgia. It is upsetting that this generation of kids that played it will have a sad, generic, watered down version of Racket and Clank to remember (or forget about) when thinking of the games of their childhood. I would rather have a remaster of the original Racket and Clank than this reboot that disregards the history and story of the original, forgets the Capitalism and greed for money that haunted the original (in a good way that build the narrative and atmosphere), and turns the two original main characters (that the series is named after for crying out load) and their character arcs, ideals, and personalities into generic garbage (compared to the ORIGINAL) that they know will sell to kids now and older people that they used nostalgia to mislead. I’m really sad about the Sly Cooper movie (cause I love the original trilogy even more than Racket and Clank, and I’m probably the Sly Cooper series biggest fan) cause I don’t want to see them make a mockery of that beloved series as well. Also why are they making it look so weird, why not make it look like remastered graphics of the original games and quit all these rebranding stuff. We all just wanted the good old Racket and Clank, but at least they were smart enough to keep his look and update it for today’s consoles so it looks really good (even if it was to sell merchandise of the main characters), but why aren’t they giving Sly Cooper and his movie the same treatment. It upsets me as a fan of the series, a gamer, and a consumer and I can only hope it is even kind of comparable to the original Sly Cooper games. Even though I don’t think the second game’s ending was perfect/what I would have done/wished for (ie. the hate chip thing, although I do love how they used that with Carmelita destroying it and Murray’s transition to the third game and all that that entails), I love the way they took it and the way they paved their way forward in the story that was uniquely there’s as a team that just finished off an amazing trilogy of games that are all highly rated which speaks for itself. But then the fourth was made by another studio and they didn’t even use the ancestors that were showcased in the Cooper vault in the third game which like ... just why? They had to go all over the place and just make a mediocre game (when put in perspective and compared to the original trilogy) but you know whatever it is just a game and although I obsess over this series (Racket and Clank by a much lesser degree, although I love those original ones too) maybe a bit too much, I still love these two series even after all this",0,0,2018-07-19T11:49:20.000Z,Strive For Transcendence,UCymMRhvf18W2cxvbGs_cCnw,NFc5uEo31lY,True,UgyahJZwNsfdB4eK-lh4AaABAg

The story is much less bombastic then it should've been, taking into account that there's a friggin' titan running across the archipelago, stomping anything in it's path. My guess is that the initial vision was much larger (two different drops of lore regarding the gods that went nowhere indicate a much bigger story, but I won't spoiler it here), but they ran out of time/funds.",1,0,2018-07-19T00:57:36.000Z,Guilherme,UCebcTQq_P0YchnQMvxEhPbg,QqNaj04lCE4,True,UgyCCh-a-4wNLacoW9B4AaABAg

"The obsession with going big before they even know how to properly fill the areas they do have is insanely annoying. They need to focus on what makes the world feel lived in so there aren't empty plains of nothing with a few scattered minerals and animals.

I suggest only going a step ahead, imagine a planet with some Key large terrain that you can fast travel between via high speed transport so each area can have proper work done into it, and then build up with space elevators that lead to a docking station, from there you could travel to near by satellite colonies or maybe even the moon(if the games planet has one and can afford that kind of memory/ram/w/e)...

"This mode was cool. I rather enjoyed the version of it in Double Agent too. Spies have a button to reach for exits/cover so if you know where it is it is easy to execute instead of getting stuck on a corner but it can lead to dumb deaths if used without consideration. Aiming as a merc felt better too, the reticle stayed centred instead of sliding around a larger area in the middle of the screen. Looks like the pc version of Chaos Theory didn't have that though.

Hacking targets as a spy made you clearly visible using the blue electromagnetic filter thing to mercs and you could determine how close they were by the speed at which the hack progressed.

"This was meant to be wee thing with examples of how other FF games had bad plot ideas or decent plot ideas with bad twist villians but in the end i started with FF8 and well..shit that all TLNSNR, becouse FF8 is a drian if you think on the plot for more than ten mins, the only reason i injoy the game is becouse the combat system in it allows you to be OP and broken from the first starting island to the point your one hitting bosses from the get go, but heres why FF8 acutaly sucks plote wise and anything else would be better.

honestly i dont see why that storyline should of been knocked back?..mean FF8..fucking time travel that was filled with loop holes and whole chunks that where lazy writtin in, heck the world was lazly done, Galbadia starts the whole story off with indaving anouther nation to get the last radio tower in the world, why?, becouse they want to tell the whole world that they have a sorcress on there side and basicly dont mess with us, but who was that too? as esther vanished from the world with no fucks given and there is no other nations, well the place they invaded i guess but start of the game they kick there ass and take the tower, barr that there is no one else out there to look tough for..if you count the shumi village and the figherman city then thats messed up each where complety aginst acts of war or conflict, but of course there just the first act, it revealed""spoilers"" that a sorcress from an unknown amount of time in the far future wants to go back anouther few decades and basicly TimeKompRestion!!! all those years into a single moment so she can eat all the sorceress powers into her self, while fighting to stop this a lady by the name ellone has for no reason has the power to send folks mind's(not there bodys just the mind) back into the past so they can see what happend there...she then hunts you at random moments by forcefully and without explianing or asking if thats all cool to you and who ever your with at the time, minds back into the bodys of three random grunts from the G army(there lot of BS fan theorys on the why but there just fans covering the crappy story) but the end goal was to get you to understand the true evil in the world. Am sorry lady we live in a world where monsters pour from the moon in a tidel wave, magics real and i can summon the acutal devil, myself and the main character wouldnt have a problem if you came up to us and siad ""excuse me but there a crazy lady useing time travel to inslave everyone, could you please stop her?"" and if your character has a problem with this, she has  throught out the game has shown she can send you at any moment in time to witness the event, thus yeah thats proof enough for me, but no three discs later after seeing this one guy fuck up nearly every moment in his life such as. not nailing the hot singer that clearly invites you up to the room for sex or a quickie, destroying his friends voicebox and thus never able to speak agian, failing to protect ellone and leaving her mum to die alone, failing to be an actor and writter and then failing to protect esther, ok he did do one thing right when the time came he shoved an evil tyrant into a space ship and lunched them into space, but anyone could of done that, he just happend to be there, oh bonus he bores himself at one point to the point HE FALLS ASLEEP ON HIMSELF!.

so why not get on board with a simple concept such as ""your girlfriend like super dieing and the cure is like in anouther civlization"" , least the end goal is there and the reason to get out there and meet folk and learn about the world is right there from the start without pulling in an evil empire then replacing it with a one man army villian and a special snow flake person to grant you the power! wich honestly in squars eyes ether boils down to remmbering friends or the magic crystals give you plot armour.


Note: FF8 was done better as a rewrite by a guy named dan on fanfic where he smashs the plot and changes it into the proper time war it was meant to be, along with haveing the mian character yelling at everyone since hes a strict soldier and everyone else is far to into there teens and whats to fuck like rabbits its a funny and compelling read.",0,0,2018-07-18T16:40:29.000Z,ViralForceMarketing,UCo-STmvTYcsdzeV4VhnmqBQ,t9CuT_mOeEs,True,UgysxvLKdbh8zK4Qnyx4AaABAg

When I play a game I tend to step outside myself and into the characters shoes. I don't think what would I decide but what would Geralt decide? I think at first Olgierd comes off as a man that should be stopped and so this is why you are helping Gaunter. Yet by the end of it you come to like the man. Realize that he was and is still human. A victim himself. Seeing is past and helping his brother. I actually came to admire Olgierd a little bit. (Plus the voice acting and writing is so good.) So when the choice came to save him or let him die I choose to save him because I feel thats what Geralt would have done as a Witcher and as a man. Seeing that Gaunter was the true demon here.

"I disagree with my previous comment. It's almost impossible to judge The Phantom Pain objectively considering how evident it is that large chunks of the game are either missing, were cut, or were possibly pushed out by Konami. My guess is Kojima really DID have something extremely taboo to say (most likely regarding the child soldiers) but Konami forced him to remove it. The entire game in general reeks of corporate sabotage (being released in a state that feels like content was cut out and/or the story was mangled by people over Kojima's head) and compromise. I feel like what we got in Chapter 2 was absolutely not what Kojima wanted it to be. The repetitive and derivative nature of the missions felt more like devs being forced to desperately fill space that was once occupied by something more meaningful.

I can't really say that I agree that it's ""overrated"" or that reviewers give it too much praise. Because without fully understanding what happened within the production of The Phantom Pain it's impossible to fully understand the reason behind its flaws, what Metal Gear Solid 5 was actually supposed to have in it that was cut out, and to what extent Kojima even wanted to make it.

"Everyone always criticizes Shadow the Hedgehog (the game, not the character), but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was 16 when it came out, and before anyone tells me to take off my nostalgia goggles, I still play it even today, and I _still_ love it. Sure, it's a bit cheesy and certainly overly edgy, but the gameplay is fun and the story is halfway decent. I love the wide array of weapons that Shadow can wield, and the massive amount of branching paths leading to the final showdown as Super Shadow against Devil Doom is really pretty cool.",2,0,2018-07-15T16:29:09.000Z,David Meyer,UC7AMjgzIpS0tvxgaNM-2DKw,-kE9BR24XIw,True,Ugwwas8TojZ1MsG-hnx4AaABAg

"Well the thing is that war in videogames is usually fun, for the same reasons that it sucks in real life, you are out there in thrilling danger and the only thing defining wether you live or die is your skill, knowledge and wits. In a videogame this is fantastic, you get to improve at the game at your own pace and your morbid curiosity is satisfied without harming any real people. You dont need to feel guilty about killing a lot of virtual people, and games will usually make it really hard for you refuse shooting someone thats about to shoot you. After all, unlike real people theres noone to mourn these virtual soldiers.
Its even better if the game is multiplayer, now you arent even killing virtual people you are just outplaying another player, you even get to feel proud. Bonus points if the kill is gruesome!

But now take the safety of your chair or couch out, picture yourself in an actual dangerous situation, doesnt even need to be war, just a situation in wich your life is in danger and your survival depends on your ability to fight and murder.
You dont get a training mode in wich you can die countless times until you learn, if you go to war most youll get is boot camp. You are on your own, or maybe you arent, wich one is worse? Just your life depending on you or your friends lifes too, if you fail to shoot that kid with the rifle it might kill you, maybe you are ok with that to avoid killing a kid, but what if he kills the man next to you, because you hesitated, maybe its not even a kid, it could just be a man spraying his gun and you see his eyes, so full of fear...
But they are the enemy right? Its just orders, maybe thats true, noone can really judge, they werent in your shoes, but real war is not fun. Just like sports wouldnt be fun if you bet your teams life everytime you play basketball. In a game that sounds like a fun twist, in reality that sounds terrifying, especially since winning just means other people die.

Its hard to make a war game with good combat mechanics be anti war, because simulations of dangerous activities are a lot of fun and you never really hurt anyone, its the stakes, the dependance on your ability to do what you have to in order to survive, that makes war terrible, and thats before we even mention collateral damage and straight up cruelty among desensitized soldiers.

Thats why spec ops works, maybe it didnt resonate with you, but for most people that were just having a blast killing enemies and bombing civilians thinking ""lol this guy is fucked up"" the moment they saw the aftermatch the game told them there are consequences, and it was obvious it wasnt the gore you are meant to enjoy, it wasnt skillfull, it wasnt heroic, it was crude and unnecessary. 
You were still safe, and noone was really hurt. But the game showed you something other shooters wouldnt, consequence, same principle that makes permadeath and quick deaths work when you actually think of it. Except spec ops did it more obviously, with intention of horrifying. Unlike permadeath wich is often a game mechanic added for the sake of tension, being only occacionally used to convey a point. 
I dont feel dread when playing arma games, them being simulators just makes it more fun, id probably play VR war games, but I could never kill another person willingly in real life, or at least I like to believe that, even if id jump at the chance of the most genuine war like gaming experience, I would never want to go to war.

"Some of this is a little nitpicky (for example, the Dragonborn being an innate ""chosen one"" as opposed to an ambiguous one with a funky reaction to a disease isn't necessarily a bad thing. Dragonborns were alluded to in lore before - though in WILDLY differing ways -, and it's a narrative choice that doesn't by itself make the game worse, or at least it doesn't have to, in the hands of more competent writers), but it's right on the money otherwise. I see why Skyrim is popular with people who haven't played other Elder Scrolls games, and it certainly is a good game by itself. But when compared to other TES games, it's hard to overcome the fact that every quest feels like a chore. Everytime I got a new quest in Skyrim I legitimately thought ""Oh, great. What draugr-infested dungeon do I have to grind my way through to get the story going?"". In Oblivion and specially Morrowind, there was much more variety and uniqueness to every quest. Not to mention much more whimsical, fantastical stuff, while Skyrim seems to go for the pseudo-Low Fantasy, GoT vibe that... again, maybe could have worked well, in the hands of more competent or invested teams.

"Here is how I typically do my main quest playthrough: at some point after escaping Helgen, either get the quest to go tell Jarl Balgruuf, about the attack, or just make my way to Whiterun.

Go to High Hrothgar, go after the Horn, go find Delphine, kill the dragon at Kynesgrove....and then after Delphine says she needs to gather info, that gives a good chance for a break to go do side quests, and generally explore Skyrim. It would have made much more sense for her to tell the player character to go get some more experience and train their skills. Then, weeks later in game time, go check in with Delphine and do the Thalmor Embassy quest and rescue Esbern, and go find Sky Haven Temple. After doing this, it is another good time to take a huge break from the main quest, however long you want before going and doing all the mages guild stuff.

"I came back to this video after playing the game and think you are overly harsh on this game. Sure, they introduced some major changes but I enjoyed it as much as the first one if not more. 

I played it on medium with one-third of my skill points invested in the magic tree and two-thirds in the swordsmanship tree. For me, combat was fairly easy to moderately challenging with the first Letho fight being pretty much the only difficulty spike.  There is a skill in the swordsmanship tree which eliminates the backstab bonus. 

I came to it right after playing the first game and without having read any of the books and the plot was not all that difficult to follow. I didn't follow the events on the map but I think I was able to follow what was going on well enough from the dialogue, in-game texts and occasional visits to the wiki. I had a bit of a difficult time remembering who was kind of what kingdom at first but not to the point that I wasn't able to grasp what was happening. I certainly enjoyed the plot. 

One problem that I have to agree with is the interface. It's certainly flawed. To me, it felt like they tried to make it work equally well with a keyboard and mouse and with a gamepad. I tried both and both felt awkward for navigating menus. Actually, I wanted to play with a gamepad because it feels more natural for me for a game like this but I had to switch. For some reason, with a gamepad, you don't have the option to choose individual items to pick up. It's all or nothing which means that you can get inventory filled with crap very quickly. Navigating menus is even more sluggish than with a mouse and keyboard even though neither is perfect. There is also a bug so that when you bring up the selection wheel, the first click of the d-pad is not registered. Also, navigating a quick-select wheel with the d-pad? I don't know what they were thinking. 

Anyway, the game controls perfectly fine with the mouse and keyboard. Allowed better control over the camera in during combat. The lock-on camera feature was admittedly pretty useless. 

Overall, I'm not saying it's without flaws and the first game did certain things better for sure but it's a very very good game. I had a great time with it and I'd certainly give it another go so I can take Yorveth's path this time. I highly recommend it.",0,0,2018-07-12T17:17:44.000Z,Vesselin Krastev,UCf-tJjER0ae8C2hV73N1CvA,lF860MCMUfQ,True,Ugw7zMpSLeCf0Vi-3p14AaABAg

"It still baffles me how so many people apparently did not see the interview with Kojima that explains the missing chapter content. He uses real life to interact with the game, like how Raiden was a surprise character and wasn't even shown for MGS2 just to surprise players. The content for MGS V was actually created to be seen but never played from the start as a meta way to make players feel what Kojima wanted them to, thats why they included it on the game disk as a feature (and in data to be mined via pc) instead of just scrapping it like they would with the rest of the real content that never made it in. It was to create a feeling of something that was once there, but is now gone. Kojima said that it was his way of showing players the experience of actual phantom pain, a medical condition involved with missing limbs (The Boss, Kaz) where you remember what its like to have something that isnt there anymore, and it hurts. Its a running theme of the game thats a result on how Kojima was dealing with the depression and emptiness of making his last metal gear work at Konami as the result of their falling out. He did pull it off as a lot of people felt upset, which is what he wanted, but its sad that so many people think of it as a game flaw instead of seeing how it was designed to make them feel what Kojima wanted to express.",0,1,2018-07-10T23:39:32.000Z,Daniel Scott,UCGAShaGd0jTi-j7uyykDfWw,KO4Tusk_V2k,True,Ugw5k-Ltys_1P7-FQRh4AaABAg

"I played Morrowind a lot.  Remember playing it when it first came out. I loved the lore. It pulled you in and made you want to explore to find more. I learned to really not like Vivec and what they did. I actually kinda felt bad about having to kill Dagoth Ur. Yea, he was about insane now but he was your friend at one time and now you have to have this end all be all battle with him. Rather sad yet something you know it right. Once I found out the all behind why Nerevar died, I really really wanted to kill Vivec. I can actually say that until this day, he is the only gaming NPC character that has never left my #1 spot to wish off. Rather makes me laugh when I play ESO with friends in doing the main story in Morrowind, any time I here NPC's say 'Praise Vivec' I curse.... 

But that is what makes Morrowind great. That story. All that detail there for you to find. You are encouraged to find 'your' path.  And like in the Video, you get a great sense of accomplishment. Takes forever it feels just to walk to the next village initially.... Do they all do that, yes but not like Morrowind imho. I have occasionally gone back to play it. No mods to make it look better.

"I know other games maybe worst in the Sonic franchise that Sonic the Hedgehog 4, but something about StH4 i hate the most.

I'm happy you feel as strong as i do about it.

Generations was that ""at long last"" moment for me with Sonic games, i thought I would never love another Sonic game. It wasn't perfect but it was what i wanted. I have no idea how they didn't capitalise on that game and remake the classic three games in that engine/style. In beggars belief they didn't realise the potential.

"I agree that the opening stages are a bit lackluster. You can tell that main focus of this game is reserved for the faction quest lines and that the whole ""rogue god stealing your soul"" portion of the story is mainly an excuse to get you out into the Deadfire region. 

With that said, I feel that the main quest gets a lot more interesting as the game progresses. This was refreshing because I feel like a lot of RPGs have a habit of maintaining a strong first two-thirds before losing their steam during the final stages. Even the first Pillars was guilty of this ;it started off with an intriguing tale about cults, epidemics, and lost memories before down-grading to a pretty by the numbers ""chase down and corner the bad guy in his evil lair"" formula. 

I don't want to give anything away, but this game's final quest was a spectacular thrill ride from beginning to end.

Good thing a year after this video was uploaded they hired a hardcore Sonic fan who made amazing fan games to be the lead developer of Sonic Mania which may be the greatest Sonic game ever made!

Sonic should have had PTSD after all the torture he went through, but he somehow came out perfectly fine despite being tortured for months.

You only fought Zurvoc, but you never fight shadow, Metal Sonic, or chaos. The controls of classic Sonic are not so great on Sonic forces.

"The 3D sections of ""Colors"" are pretty good.  Although, they inherit the problems from ""Unleashed"" of being a boost-happy auto-runner with no exploration, slower platforming sections, nor Spin Dash, and no you still do not have enough reaction time. Plus, there are lousy underwater sections that last too long and a stupid time limit on the cyan laser Wisp that would thankfully be corrected in ""Lost World.""

However, the 2D sections absolutely suck!  Sonic's acceleration is back at the ""Sonic 4"" level of molasses, the platforming physics (especially concerning the double jump) are very wonky and imprecise, and the level designs are horrible with numerous bottomless pits with little warning and entire levels masochistically designed around a single wisp gimmick over bottomless pits.

I still don't understand how ""Colors"" got the good critical reception it has.

On the other hand, the 2D physics and level design were VASTLY improved in ""Generations"" to where they were almost as good as the classic games (or dare I say it, even better) in many places.

"Wow, someone is salty about ""Sonic Adventure.""
1.) There's nothing wrong with starting with a simple boss fight.  See: ""Super Metroid.""
2.) The sections of running towards the camera are not too long, and they're cleverly designed so that you don't easily lose your way or perspective.
3.) The rare times the camera switches to fixed angles are telegraphed and easy enough to maneuver.  Otherwise, it does a very good job of automatically adjusting behind your back.
4.) Whatever niggles the camera system has, it's still leagues better than the mostly manual systems used in games like the 3D Mario platformers.
5.) If you can't handle basic sections like that beach pier, you just suck at the controls.  You were clearly not meant to turn right until you actually hit the right turn on the pier.  Why in the world would you start turning in advance?!  This is Sonic, not Mario Kart!
6.) Sonic does not accelerate too quickly or at least not by much.  The basic gameplay of the Adventure duology is how you do 3D Sonic right.

"Your reasons to critizice Sonic Adventure are quite stupid, to be honest. 
And it just feels like trying to force nitpicks that barely affect the gameplay.

-Starting with a boss is actually fine, since it allows you to get used pretty fast to the controls (Chaos doesn't get any tricky until the third hit) and allows players to get used fast to the new homming attack ability Sonic has, it gives you enough space and time to get used briefly to the controls before sending you to an actual level.

-The long sections where the camera is backwards is extremelly stupid too, since that's theres nothing to actually kill you in that scene, you only need to hold down on the controller and that's about it, the only way you can fuck up this part if by intentionally trying to fuck up in this section, since the whale can barely hit you.

-The controls are actually really good, heck, they're the most responsible in the series, if you go forward or change directions, Sonic will instantly do it with no problem or having to go on ice skating like in modern games where Sonic is always on ice physics when walking normally, this is specially better on the Dreamcast controller since it has full direction of movement and you can easily move the way you want it to, even if you commit small mistakes, you can easily save yourself due to how good the controls are in this game.
Also that example of the camera fucking you up near the whale scene blaming the camera, no, that was entirely your fault, since you clearly went and moved Sonic to that direction and the camera barely moves there since it's a fixed camera, don't blame the game on you playing badly on purpose.

-11:56 See, in this section you clearly showed how the camera moves to the direction you have to go, and you can clearly Sonic moving to this same direction alongside the camera, why would you move to a full right instead of slowly going from Up to right when the control has full 360 movement, Sonic doesn't have 4 directional movement nor you play with a D-Pad to being able to fuck up something so simple, and it feels like you're just trying to find an excuse to bash the game when it's just doing something so simple

-On 12:00 you talk about this, but then you show a part where you move backwards to the stage, to a part where you can easily go to without needing to move the camera, as it does this for you, so even if you missed this part and decided to go back, the fixed camera of that place would do it for you instead of having to manually doing so

-The acceleration is just bullshit as i said before, Sonic's momentum is actually really good and it's perfect for the level design there is in this game, there is not a single time where this momentum can actually hurt and it's actually benefitial, and it's really good for precise jumps.

Honestly the only thing i see here is someone being biased and that sucks on a game, and blames the game for your own problems that the game has nothing to do with.

"Okay, I'm sorry, but after your Sonic Heroes first level review I had to stop. YouTube kept recommending this video to me and I finally took my time to check it out, since it looked really interesting, but now I'm just glad I never watched a video like this a few years ago, because I would have never played SADX and SA2, since you basically treated both games like garbage. I know those games have flaws. A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FLAWS, but it doesn't mean they completely suck, like you implied.

And I know those are supposed to be reviews from the first level only, but camera issues is something that happens during the entire game, and it's not nearly as bad as you made it to be. Neither is the song in SA2 hard to listen because of literally SECONDS of admittedly annoying noise at the beginning of the level. And then in Sonic Heroes (not even gonna mention you saying ""the theme song is garbage"", as much as I dislike that song too, is downright ignorance stating your opinion as if it was a solid fact) you complain that you never got to play Heroes because everybody said it was bad, and that maybe ""everybody is crazy"" for hating that game.

So yea, maybe people ARE crazy and making poor reviews of Sonic games on YouTube, imposing their opinions instead of legitimate impartial reviews, raising the bad points AND the good points about them, just like someone you might know. Maybe that's why you never got to play something you might've enjoyed.

"My perspective on this game is really different, but that might be where I'm coming from. I love this game to pieces, and I think it's because I avoided playing Far Cry 4, feeling it was just too similar to Far Cry 3 without enough fixes to the formula. Primal, in comparison, was enough of a gap from 3 for me to really enjoy it. It certainly helped that I chose to play in Survivor mode, which basically takes out most of the negative traits it shares with the other games (like the minimap being taken out or flashing indicators being removed in favor of using Hunter Vision) as well as giving meaning to hunting by making meat more than just a healing item. Also, it removes some of the more overpowered abilities, like the owl bombing runs. The removal of guns actually makes for an interesting challenge that makes stealth fun, allowing me to make the most out of my whole toolset.

"I found this video fascinating for an odd reason. While I dug all of the Kojima ""Solid""s for their individual narratives, as well as their roles as pieces of the overarching series' plot, this was the first one where I found myself sort of slogging through the gameplay--loving the story as I progressed enough for it to unfold, but kind of groaning as I foraged for reptiles to eat and the right makeup to wear. Now, I realize: All the things you (as well as countless other players) love about this game and find elevate it above the other entries, are the exact same things that contributed to me disliking it. I'm not the type of player that 'blames' a game for my own taste, though, so I can still realize what an expertly crafted and designed game this is, especially when you consider just how downright DIFFERENT it is from the previous two, what with the open jungle environment, nutrition system and Cold War-era gear (NO SOLITON RADAR?!!). I just personally 'clicked' better with the more streamlined, slick,  undoubtedly 'simpler' approach to stealth gameplay in the first 2 MGS, which really let you feel like a legendary mercenary zipping through the grunts and so the plot, but I completely understand how to a certain type of gamer that would lack challenge and thus appeal. I really would like to give this game a go now, though (I haven't played it since about a year or so post-release).

"deus ex 1 was very good at juggling both gameplay openness and respecting the political background on which its crazy conspiracies take place, it knew about the silliness of its plot, but it didn't treat it like a joke. i feel like deus ex human rev tried more to pay respect to the original while crafting their own aesthetics and style instead of doing what the original deus ex did. In human rev you are passing through a cyborg renaissance, but the in game discussions about the rebirth of mankind are hopelessly infantile, the discussion on transhumanism seemed to lack some kind of essencial philosophical background as well. The ending (spoilers) had you deciding between three extremes, divided really into two polar extremes: freedom or regulation, Should corporations have the freedom to experiment (which doesn't seem to fit with any IRL discussion i know off, so its locked to the in-game plot, most ""experimenting"" in the regard of human improvement is definitely not carried out by the private sector, but by the public sector, namely universities. also it seems to me that giving freedom to corporations is just a bad idea in general) with the future of humanity, calling out a notion of neo-liberal distopia, or should this growth be ""regulated"" by the Illuminati (which doesn't seem to enter in any IRL discussion as well) just another option that removes control way from the masses, or majority, and right into the hands of the minority, leaving the only remaining option, the one about revealing the unaltered truth to the masses, the only one that seems to fit well with the revolutionary actions of past deus ex games(and supposedly, the intended one by the devs which is odd, seeing how they decided to ignore all of that in DEUS ex MD).
 So as far as discussing control, unregulated corporate control over humanity or distopic governamental measures and shadowy international affairs that end up affecting every human being on the planet, deus ex human rev's attempt, although there, just ends up falling flat on its face. 
Yet its gameplay is so fun and engaging, even with its ""one button takedowns"" that knock out all the two legged enemies in the game at the cost of a battery charge, the game feels like its giving me the same kind of control deus ex 1 tried to do. To people like me, that means that i get to be a mass murdering psychopath and get way with it. but in the end the plot and background of Adam Jensen make my psychotic actions even less (if not entirely negates it) of a statement of the unregulated or shadowy range of action that a federal agent has over civilians and the ""law"" itself for the name of an etheral, poorly understood but ever present ""cause"", that gives justifications to all murdering sprees regardless of sides, which of course is or should be the point of the game in the first place. Deus ex 1, even through its gameplay, is suppose to be, in my view, an iconoclastic game. Notions of good and evil are thrown out of the door right out the bat by the fantastic encounter with the terrorist leader in the first hour of the game, notions of morality are also destroyed as you reach the plot twist in the middle of the game, and so are any notions of structure and power that players may still have about society and the all watchful government. It is a beautiful game and so far, rather unsurpassed on its approach to political discussion. It kinda takes a piss with it by concretizing silly pharmaceutical companies styled conspiracies that are too far fetcher to coincide with reality, its still part of what made the game so great but at the same time gave a tint of ""discuss these topics but not too hard"" vibe, even though the moment the player begins listening to the complex, big worded dialogues, full of the isms necessary to discuss not politics as a whole but contemporary philosophy of politics, then the magic happens, and all of that piss taking is put into question, maybe these conspiracies are not ridiculously far fetcher after all. A beautiful piece of metanarrative IHMO, that can be translated into reality as well.",0,0,2018-07-01T01:53:37.000Z,Paulo H,UCy6S4YVl-oX1m5ixXpbYK3Q,GnoiZ7s6EF8,True,Ugykd04FRNBvDIi0sSx4AaABAg

"Having finally cleared pretty much everything in this game, I agree that it's a flawed masterpeice.. but for different reasons.

Once you git gud, the first few floors are just filler to gather resources to have a go at the bosses that are still challenging (one of the ones on floor 4 and the true final boss on floor 6 for me).. and that process takes too long. It's not built for 20-40 minute runs (thats more like boss rush mode), normally a full '1C' run is 1hr-1hr 15 which makes the long-term impact of poor RNG all the more draining.

Also, ammo. Losing a perfectly good run due to bad RNG on ammo drops sucks, especially when the game keeps giving you hears you dont need.

And the breaking the forth wall was done in a way where it engaged the player! A video game has NEVER done this at that level. It was amazing!!!

And you complain about the cut-scenes!? In my personal opinion I loved the cut scenes because of the action camera angles you also mentioned. It was like playing a movie as a video game. It was so cool. 

 You also complain about how Hideo tells the story of this game saying, ""its not the most elegant or effective to tell a game story but its entertaining"" wow PURE stupidity. Again this was yet another strong point of MGS. Oh and by the way, this game was to be played passively!!!!!!! It's a STEALTH ACTION GAME!!!!!

Am sorry but these videos of your critical up close were just awful!!!!! Not everything you said was garbage, you made some good and valuable facts but your video was a big let down. It was very irritating and annoyed the crap outta me.

"Every time a new technology hits, we get about a 5 year period where developers try to use it by overlaying previous methods. EG: nintendo & sega went 3D, they kept bungling around with trying to overlay 2D style gaming into a 3D world, and failing miserably.

Part of this is because the jump to each dimension in gaming requires exponentially more calculations and graphics. Going from a no-D text adventure to a 2D game requires at least some rudimentary physics calculations and more input control programming that you didn't need before. Jumping from 2D to 3D also requires a lot more physics calculations, and also more graphics calculations since yuo're now dealing with polygons that have faces and images stretched across them instead of 2D backgrounds that scroll and images on them that go through frame progression to animate.

So, when the first gen of consoles showed up that could pull off 3D .. (eg: N64) ... there was a massive sucktacular learning curve by the developers on how to use it. It had more processing power, but a lot of that was going towards just supporting the basic structure needed for a full-3D game (polygon processing, etc). And it was barely hanging on, hence you see very simple games.. but zelda, mario, sonic all worked in regards to looking cartoony, so the 3D graphics weren't bad. But, sonic needed speed, and being able to pipe in and process the graphics at a fast rate were taxing to the system. Plus, the developers were trying to find ways to translate 2D-style game play that people grew up with and loved into 3D, and then they had to fight with coding camera controls and other stuff.. it was a big learning curve, and it was being shoe-horned into systems that barely had enough power to handle it.

Also, around this time we were still coming off the ""every game is now a CD, so it MUST have FMV (full motion video) or super-long cut scenes, b/c now we can pad our game with bloated story!"" FMV and cut scenes were useful when used properly, but awful when shoe-horned into games that should have focused on action.

Basically.. like every industry .. when something new shows up everyone gets into ""new toy"" syndrome, and they want to find anyway to shoe-horn the new tech or process or whatever into their thing, even when it shouldn't be. It takes about a 5 year cycle for folks to work that shit out of their system and finally come to some kind of industry standard on how to best use something. But, when it comes to creativity.. every new person thinks they're going to creatively do something different and better.. so you end up in these cycles where people go through this same bullshit again thinking they can do it better by doing it different instead of sticking with an industry standard. And then a new technology, bell/whistle shows up, and you go through the intro cycle again. (EG: with VR, how we're suffering through the growing pains of folks trying to adapt traditional 3D games to VR now .. or like how we went through a fad of quick-time-events.. then they died off.. now we're seeing more games trying toa buse that crap again.. poorly.)",0,0,2018-06-28T17:44:03.000Z,therandomdot,UChdBdmqw51HRcCfGNn3j4Hw,-kE9BR24XIw,True,UgxIriN4bfWsQ6JjBN54AaABAg

The came out gothic 3 and oblivion, the ""next gen of rpgs"" and what was that? ""We got a larger computer generated world! No we got the larger computer generated world!"" While gothic 3 was just incomplete, oblivion's world was just boring, everything was built from the same assets, the dungeons were randomly if not generated then populated.
