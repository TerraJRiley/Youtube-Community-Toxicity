"People should not dislike the movie over gender roles. However the stubborn idea that in order for new characters to evolve they must kill Mark Hamill is what made The Last Jedi weak.

At least this movie helps identify who is and is not prejudice. The movie was not that bad and people who are not alive yet will enjoy it more so than the rest of us.

"Although freak shows were viewed as a place for entertainment, they were also a place of employment for those who could advertise, manage, and perform in its attractions. In an era before there was welfare or worker‚Äôs compensation, severely disabled people often found that placing themselves on exhibition was their only choice and opportunity for making a living. Despite current values of the wrongness of exploitation of those with disabilities, during the nineteenth century performing in an organized freak show was a relatively respectable way to earn a living. Many freak show performers were lucky and gifted enough to earn a livelihood and have a good life through exhibitions, some becoming celebrities, commanding high salaries and earning far more than acrobats, novelty performers, and actors. The salaries of dime museum freaks usually varied from twenty-five to five hundred dollars a week, making a lot more money than lecture-room variety performers.

"I wish the movie would have touched on more things in the book. Such as Nick admitting he didn't love his mistress and began the affair based on his own inadequacies and insecurities. 

I also wish it would have touched on how Nick didn't just stay for the baby. But on how he viewed Amy's actions as love and was even weirdly impressed that she killed a man for him. If the movie included this stuff I am sure he would have had more fun sinning it. 

Usually the movies miss a lot from the books. This was disappointing as it did not include that Nick basically was turned on by the fact Amy was psycho. Or that Amy continued to blackmail Nick with frozen vomit (mixed with poison) to ensure he would never cheat again.

"What the film ‚ÄúHome‚Äù can teach kids about Autism

When I took my kids to see the 2015 animated film ‚ÄúHome‚Äù I was blown away. To me as a person who loves many people with Autism Spectrum Disorder, it seemed like the entire movie was a parable for what it‚Äôs like for kids with ASD as they attempt to navigate life.

The hook of ‚ÄúHome‚Äù is that aliens called the Boov invade Earth and relocate all human beings. As a species, Boovians are cowardly, antisocial, and strict rule followers. They avoid confrontation whenever possible. But Oh, the main character, is different from the rest of the Boov. He is eager to make friends and fit in, yet everything he does annoys his neighbors. When Oh tries his hardest to blend in, he sticks out the worst. The customs of his fellow Boov are foreign to Oh. They speak a social language he can barely understand.

Facial expressions also confound Oh. He doesn‚Äôt understand when another Boov is angry with him. When Oh attempts to make friendly conversation, he drives Boovians further away.

Despite his lack of social awareness, Oh is quite brilliant. He‚Äôs a mechanical genius, even by the advanced technological standards of his fellow aliens. Oh has a gigantic heart and proves himself to be a loyal friend.

Jim Parsons did an exceptional job voicing Oh and made him a loveable character in spite‚Äìand because of‚Äìhis quirks.

As a former teacher, I think ‚ÄúHome‚Äù could be a great tool for classroom conversations because it could help neurotypical children empathize with students who have ASD. ‚ÄúHome‚Äù can also help children better understand relatives who have ASD which is an ongoing topic in so many households today.

Besides all that ‚ÄúHome‚Äù is entertaining too!
So i Think when you see this movie from a perspective of AUTISM you will get it better...",6,0,2018-10-21T12:43:44.000Z,yentl555,UCD7tswJTjUuzz-dLsTirsLw,9QM7X6JjlCo,True,Ugzu2CTqwjkX8zJpj254AaABAg

"Valerian- the comic story
Whether you like the film or not; the comic book is quite different. And a better story than in the movie. The movie is action packed while the comic is the opposite. Maybe therein lies the reason why the script was changed so much. And Laureline is the main protagonist in the comic.
Over to the comic version, which I shall here tell its story. Somewhat compressed, since some elements aren‚Äôt vital to the story.
It begins with the first module of Alpha station. It was not made by humans and is very old. So old that its originators are long forgotten. The comic doesn‚Äôt suggest its age, but I would believe at least a couple of hundred thousand years or maybe much more. And other species have added their modules to it since its beginning. 
The Alpha station in the comic is probably much larger than the movie version. And its core, is full of abandoned old modules from races extinct or forgotten. 
When the story starts, humanity is the most powerful race in the galaxy, with its ‚ÄòEarth Federation‚Äô of sorts. Because humanity has just recently added their module to the station, I believe it is far away from Earth, maybe on the other side of the galaxy. 
Valerian and Laureline are travelling in their spaceship to Alpha station with an important passenger; Earth‚Äôs ambassador to Alpha station. People have suggested that Tarkin from Star Wars may be modelled after the ambassador. 
The ambassador stresses that this is a very important mission and he is very secretive. Val and Lau are a bit skeptical to this. The ambassador gives Laureline the little hedgehog like creature we see in the film. She is advised to protect it at all cost. Valerian and Laureline is to be his personal bodyguards for the mission.
After arrival at Alpha station earth module, the ambassador is starting a speech to the crew of the module. Suddenly a hole is blasted through a nearby wall. Through the hole, a bunch of aliens with non-lethal cocoon blasters are appearing, opening fire on everyone. Much like in the movie, but the aliens are the big brown ones from the movie that Valerian and Bubble had to save Laureline from. 
Valerian shouts to Laureline ‚ÄòGet your helmet on! Quick‚Äô, as they are still wearing spacesuits. Valerian is the first to see what happens next; the ambassador is abducted. He rushes after them through an air lock to the alien ship waiting outside. He is immediately captured and put in stasis, as the same with the ambassador. 
Laureline wakes up and notices both the ambassador and Valerian is gone. She still has the little money-making creature, so she buys information about the whereabouts of these aliens. Through the film‚Äôs Bubble, she infiltrates their base on Alpha. They are celebrating the success of the abduction. And through video it is shown that Valerian and the ambassador is handed over to the whale creatures on a nearby planet. 
So Laureline is searching for their habitat. And finds a guy with a submarine. Here the film is accurate towards the comic. Via the submarine they steal a jelly fish which is a communication device for the whale creatures. And they just escape. Laureline puts the jellyfish over her head to see what information it has. And it reveals that the whale creatures fly to meet another strange ship, a cigar shaped vessel with what looks as sails. The two men in stasis are loaded aboard the new vessel. Then the jellyfish explodes, and Laureline is not having a good time now, covered in jellyfish. 
Since the whale creatures aren‚Äôt going to talk, Laureline must find a new way to locate the two men. She buys information about a species that specializes in dreams. With their technology and a hefty sum they can connect her to another mind. She goes to sleep and dreams about Valerian. In her dream she sees Valerian and the ambassador, now both awoken, landing on a beach like the one the paradise planet in the film. 
The two are greeted by the inhabitants, looking like the people from the paradise planet, except they have deep red skin. The ambassador, furious, threatens them, pointing out mighty Earth will put an end to this. The aliens say threats are useless. 
The red skinned aliens tell them the story that they built the first module of Alpha station long ago. And since then they have ascended to near godlike beings, forever hidden from others. 
And now the ambassadors plan is revealed; Earth has an armada ready to seize control over the Alpha station. And the red skinned aliens say that this they cannot allow. With just a thought they can annihilate the armada if it attacks. 
And so ends Laurelines dream. She know she must head to the core of Alpha station. She finds an entrance blocked by rubble. With her blaster she clears the rubble and enters. 
And the entrance opens to another dimension where she is now on the beach she saw in her dream. There is nobody there except Valerian and the ambassador. Valerian and Laureline kiss.
Then they follow the ambassador to the station‚Äôs council, where all races are represented. And the council know what has happened. The council expels Earth from Alpha station for a hundred years. And the armada heads back to Earth, not daring to challenge the red skinned aliens. 
On the way home Laureline, who has become attached to the little hedgehog creature, gives it a well-deserved recharge in the ship‚Äôs reactor.
The End. 
Some notes;
The brown aliens in the films who want to serve Laureline as a dish to their ruler are too primitive in the film. They are not believable as a space faring species, which is sort of hinted at being the rule to join Alpha station. In the comics they are more like mercenaries and seem more sophisticated. 
Laureline is in the comic seduced by ‚ÄòBubble‚Äô in a Greek Adonis form, but she snaps out of it and makes a deal to infiltrate the brown skinned aliens. Bubble with Laureline inside takes on a brown skinned alien temptress form. And Laureline complains Bubble should have used a more discreet entrance. Also, Bubble is not a slave and runs a very lucrative business with others of her/his kind. Bubble does not die in the comic story. In fact, nobody dies. 
Through her mission Laureline is accompanied by a scared protocol officer that escaped the attack and subsequent abduction. He is more a comic relief and is rather useless to Laureline. She tells him what is going on all the time since he is clueless. In a way that makes Laureline kind of a storyteller in the comic. 
Laureline first travel to some Nordic centaur people that might know about the brown skinned aliens. Some funny scenes, but not vital story wise.  
The money- making hedgehog creature is not the last one. But they are very elusive, and few have been seen or even captured. Prior to the mission it has been brainwashed to accept Laureline. They might not be so adorable in the wild. 
A blue-skinned species, kinda like the first alien species we meet in the film, call Alpha station their home. Their planet was destroyed long ago, and they mostly live on Alpha. They are very descent species, and they perform a lot of the maintenance on Alpha. They don‚Äôt have a habitat on their own, so they dwell in the corridors between habitats and they breathe air like many other species. In the end of the story they begin arresting other aliens they suspect are fueling the corruption on Alpha station. They cannot be bribed, so the council probably approved this. 
One of the ambassador‚Äôs argument for taking over Alpha was to rid it of corruption, which is said to be high. Instead the blue-skinned aliens took the job. Probably for the better. Man can be bribed. These blue-skinned aliens cannot. 
Clive Owen, his robots and the space battle is in the film only. So is the mission to retrieve the hedgehog creature. The red-skinned god-like aliens never mentions this creature in the comic. And they probably don‚Äôt need anything from anyone else. Since Bubble has no pimp, Ethan Hawke‚Äôs character isn‚Äôt in the comic. 
The last thing Laureline sees in her dream is that Valerian and the ambassador are guided into a hut at the beach to meet the red-skinned people‚Äôs children, who will tell them a story. The ambassador says they will brainwash us! After this, when Laureline meets the ambassador, he seems much more agreeable. Valerian probably also, but he is glad to see Laureline. 
The Earth ship design in the comic looks somewhat Mon Calamari from Star Wars. We know George Lucas has borrowed some things from Valerian comics.",0,0,2018-10-21T05:26:52.000Z,Kulumuli,UCv1Yu_pVoR0rFFyQo4qi2pg,mrP091iwcIk,True,UgwJkGmBnALhdgpREVB4AaABAg

So how much money they have bc they gonna have to rob a lot more then they are in Detroit to be able to afford a even more trashy place then what they are living in now. This movie is so ducking stupid. You see people going to California thinking they will have a perfect rich good life and end up realizing shortly after getting there how expensive and hard it is to even live there and you can even pay half the bills on what money you got and end up coming back home I‚Äôve seen so many not so big youtubers make the mistake.

"According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

  
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

"This film made me so mad. I wanted jump out a window of a 5 story bilding. I love the books but this??? I would rather watch the Percy Jackson movies. I hate the Percy Jackson movies. I am so sory for all the cast and crew who spent time making this rubish. I feel sory for everyone who spent there time watching this.
(Sory for the negativity, but is there anything good about this film?)

Edit: I am dyslexic and find reading hard. And the fact that I read the first book in a day says a lot. It took about 9 hours (including breaks for food and stuf) but I loved it so much. I normaly get my sister, a friend or my parents ( yes, I still do that even tho I am in my late teens. You try living with dyslexia!) to read to me (or use audio books) as I often can't understand what I read. And the fact that I read this in a day, is amazing.

"I actually enjoyed most of this movie, and though it had multiple plot holes and multiple different problems in its ""science"", I thought it was an overall decent sci-fi/space movie, but there was one glaring problem that kept it as an okay movie instead of a really good movie; the fact that there was no foresight or plan in place in the chance that one or more pods were to malfunction. You would think with some multi trillion dollar futuristic space travel program where thousands of passengers are out into a deep sleep for a near century and was controlled by A.I. for the vast majority of the journey that one of the first things they would account for was what to do if a passenger somehow woke up early. I find it hard to believe that during this decades long journey controlled by A.I. that not one person asked what to do if there were a pod malfunction leading to some poor unfortunate person to have to live their entire life on a spaceship hurling through space while everyone else slept. That should have been one of the very first things addressed during the planning and construction of this whole fucking plan. Seriously, each pod should have had a back up system that allowed anyone who accidentally woke up early to lay back down in the pod and fall back asleep, lol.",0,0,2018-10-20T20:10:51.000Z,Jason Bowman,UCEh47USD1CGD_D9PbmBo9mw,jz_gA1IjDW4,True,Ugz1yCpRkxvaw2er4cl4AaABAg

Reactions to this have ranged from kids stopping at the walkway and refusing to come over to parents noticing me halfway up to the house and letting out a started scream.

You guys are hilarious. If you guys aren‚Äôt smart enough to understand the movie why even talk shit about man. Like seriously twilight is the best movie I‚Äôve ever watched..... and it totally makes sense for me.... all what she had to us choose between a human life or vampire life. And she chose vampire not because she likes havin super power .... no but instead to protect her self from all the other vampires are attacking her. She doesn‚Äôt want Edward or Jacob lose thier life protectin her... also about the first sex they had... the bed didn‚Äôt break because she was a human and he was a vampire.... but because he wasn‚Äôt so ready to do that because she‚Äôs still a human being and sex isn‚Äôt just like huggin or kissin... which means it has more feelings into it... and that makes Edward get so mad because he can‚Äôt have regular sex wit her.. he would like literally bite her... but neither of them wanted Bella to be a vampire yet... and the second time them havin sex..  is wen she was a vampire too which doesn‚Äôt make him wanna bite her anymore and she‚Äôs just lik him ....... Alice and her bf never broke a bed or they didn‚Äôt have a bed in the entire house ..... but Alice build that house for her soo quick because they are fast and idk if you guys remember Edward packin‚Äô up to go back wen they were on honeymoon... he was a damn fast dude. So Alice and they other ppl built the house for Edward and Bella and they purposely put the bed in so they make us think that Bella did choose to be a vampire but she‚Äôs still going to live like she did before not exactly tho but that‚Äôs the point we have to think of by our selfs... you made talked shit about when the guy and girl that Alice brought after the fight the way they were walkin and the camera had to walk slow with them but guess what you are already bored because you just figured that the whole fight isn‚Äôt real ... so why do ya guys want to yo what happenes to Bella‚Äôs doughter because that is going to make movie longer...,0,0,2018-10-20T19:14:40.000Z,Vazikeen Arshak,UCOQPyDuiOGhajL_4y2boWlA,LwkW7g7jt_Y,True,UgyHrEKnB8z-B4pIZap4AaABAg

"Actually CinemaSins, you're wrong.  Michael was shot 6 times, not 4.  Dr. Loomis shot him once to knock him away from Laurie (yet for some reason, he waited for Michael to put his mask back on, and THEN fired the first shot, which should have been an additional sin right there, ""Oh, I can see his face!  But l have to wait for him put his mask back on, before I can blow this asshole away.""  If he were smart, Loomis would have opened up the instant Michael paused while strangling Laurie after she ripped his mask off.), then followed him into the bedroom that Michael staggered/backpedaled into, then he emptied the rest of the cylinder (the other 5 rounds) into him.  

I think, however, one part that SHOULD have been sinned was after Laurie escapes the first time and is upstairs telling Tommy & Lindsay that she killed him (when she stabbed him with a knitting needle), during the closeup of Laurie telling them that, if you look over her shoulder, you can see moonlight reflecting briefly off the blade of Michael's infamous chef's knife as he comes around the post at the top of the stairs.

"Living in a nonlinear timeline means that Event B may be experienced before Event A while in a linear timeline Event A is a prerequisite for the occurrence of Event B. However, it also means that the timeline may branch out in complex ways with multiple past leading to different presents and futures. Also, the observer is able to experience multiple points on the timeline simultaneously. The subject as presented in the movie is to retain a primary existence in the present but able to experience forward and backward in the timeline in a limited way. This makes sense for a being with a finite mind. You could hypothesize that a being with near infinite mental faculties could forego an existence characterized by experiencing single discrete moments in the timeline in favor of an existence that is spread uniformly across time in a state of simultaneity.

Also, Obi-Wan falling right above a speeder seems hard to believe I agree.

"Calm Down Sinner....remember, ""Just Breathe""

So you overloaded the movie.....what do you have to show for it??????  Money $$$$$$ for a trip to a Brothel, NO!!!!

You hated the flick okay, its NOT the first is it???  No, so what did I take from the picture, well the Artwork in Meems here is GREAT.

I connect the Dragons Breath of Excalibur and meld it with the FORCE LINKED 2, *THE MISTS OF MAGIC* a Medichlorient Laced Magic Fog and to greater worlds where Magitech is the norm on many worlds....So the Dragons Breath and the Force are ONE....

The Dragons Breath spreading Medichlorients Laced *MISTS OF MAGIC* are all over in this movie and when I buy a copy the images will be part of the documentation spelling out the use in a 2nd Edition Advanced Dungeons AND DRAGONS rule set will also connect to the ALLSPARK and the Energy Cubes of the Legacy of the Primes connected to MERLIN....

"Actually I think I can defend Laurie dismissing Tommy about seeing Michael and only her sightings of him. First, when the other kids were trying to scare Tommy about Michael, all she knew was that the kids were referring to Michael as ""the boogeyman"" and not by his real name. Second, she could easily dismiss the hype surrounding ""the boogeyman"" without knowing that's what Michael was nicknamed and that's who she was looking at. So, it's not like Tommy and Laurie were on the same page about Michael being the same person even when he was carrying Annie's body in the house. When Laurie looked out the window it just reinforced the idea that Tommy was still spooked about the urban legend about Michael even though he saw him and Laurie just missed him.",0,0,2018-10-20T02:44:27.000Z,Gasparro18,UCrU8kH-AbjaPFaP62g9qBMg,tNZSFJ3iE8g,True,UgyENC7WGYy-_kjOBKB4AaABAg

"2:53 - I disagree. While I understand the reasoning behind the sin, I would've removed a sin for making sure said arcade game is only ever in the background, never in the center of frame, and the characters aren't that close to it. A pretentious asshole of a director would've ended the conversations that took place there with the camera turning to and moving toward it while music played to say ""LOOK! LOOK! DID YOU KNOW THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON AN ARCADE GAME? LOOK LO- MOM! YOU'RE NOT LOOKING! LOOK!!!""
3:13 - I feel like this deserves a sin off. I mean grizzled, meat-head, gun-toting, scarred douchebag gets all these focused tracking shots following his every move on the way to the wolf makes the audience think: ""Sigh... Oh goodie, *another* brainless military grunt-type who's going to go after the wolf, everyone else will be killed, he'll inexplicably survive, and then literally *everything* else is going to take a backseat so that *this* asshole can be the antagonist final boss of the movie instead of the *ACTUAL* GIANT MONSTERS."" Nope! Guy arrives and dies *just* like the rest of the meathead brigade!

"Sorry, real relationship sin is bullshit. Most relationships you see aren't like that, perhaps including yours, but that's because those relationships include persons who are completely compatible. People have apathetic relationships nowadays, from not wanting to be alone/not wanting to wait. I'm in a relationship with a woman who i don't deserve, and she's fucking phenomenal. I don't say this to be the typical American macho cliche (I want people to know a symptom of true love), but her and i can't keep our hands off each other. We are each others diaries, we even have our own little language. We are more than best friends, like this movie portrays Wade and his girl. So if you're in a relationship with someone you're kind of comparable with, then I can see that (sin for having too much sex), But this movie outright shows that these two are completely compatible (the uncle and uncles wasn't about who got hurt worse, it was to show the similarity in perspectives).

Th3Birdman is right, do you even watch the movies or are you just spewing sins and artificially lengthening the runtime of these videos just to pad your wallet? Also, finally did you even comprehend why they put in a jumpscare at 8:17? It's because Laurie is scared of the oncoming storm (Michael) and this is a way to emphasize it.

"The worst part being that the dinos are fake; not only were they grown in a lab, the last movie flat out told us that most of the species we see aren't even true to form due to modifications to make them look and seem more appealing, and not just the hybrids. They aren't real dinos, that T-Rex should have feathers, damnit. Those ""velociraptors"" are too big and need feathers, too. Then you have the countless roars that most of the species wouldn't emit, the inaccurate motions, and the hyper aggression that wouldn't be found in the original species. In short, those dinos are fake, and not even in the CGI sense.
So ""save the dinos"" is basically more like ""save my genetically modified death babies that I forced into the world to exploit for profit""

Honestly, if the ""Zia"" annoying chick were eaten or at least partially dismembered, I'd have liked the movie. We get random 2D bad guys getting munched towards the end, which isn't really befitting of what they're guilty of, but this annoying bimbo pretending to be badass and smart really could've used one less arm or leg, or something. Having to sit through her scenes was agonizing enough to wanna see a dino mess her up, even more than any of the villains.

Blue is actually a featherless Utahraptor, not a velociraptor; a real velociraptor would basically be a lizard chicken, as they were feathered and as small as one. Sleeping next to a wounded chicken isn't really that difficult. I mean, it's 20-goddamn-18 and we're still being fed fake dino garbage. I'm trying not to be an annoyed nerd about it, but damn. Least Jurassic World could've done was bring in a feathered Rex to showcase next to the old one; ""We've made new dinosaurs for this attraction which are meant to be accurate to their original appearances; we've kept the original Jurassic Park Rex in a cage near our new one so people attending the park could see the difference of outdated renditions vs newer evidence."" But then again, JW gave us the ""INDOMINUS REX"", when it's basically a fake version of a Giganotosaurus with some powers.
What's worse, of course, is that while the original Jurassic Park movie was being made, and they were going to include the enlarged ""velociraptors"", the production team were told that paleontologists in Utah literally discovered large raptors similar to those they were going to depict in the film, to which a producer remarked, ""Wow. You guys dream it up, and then they find it."" But instead of slightly redoing the script to cash in on that new find, they stick to the inaccurate term and mislead people to this very day.

Gotta love how the whole Indoraptor-Is-Loose scenario is just a blatant rip off of the first Jurassic Park with the raptor pack chasing the two kids in the kitchen. Like, why? Shouldn't that have been something for the first JW, not the sequel? Why did we go from JP3 ""Convince the expert to go back to the island"", to Lost World ""They're shipping the dinos to the mainland"", to JP1 ""Kid outruns a fake raptor"" bit? This movie has so much fake tension. There's no payoff to people getting away when you know they will; there's no pay off to bad guys getting brutalized by dinos when we never care enough about them as villains to feel relieved when they're ripped off the screen.

I predict the next movie is going to have people get slightly injured by dinos, but the ""good guys"" of this movie will remain good guys by showing how we can live with dinos in harmony, which we cannot. I mean, if you're dumb enough to suggest a Rex is going to deliberately go to a zoo to have a roaring match with a domesticated lion for a montage, you're dumb enough to play up the ""Dinos are our friends!"" bit even more.",0,0,2018-10-19T13:04:03.000Z,Einbjorn,UC3WB1qzUSm4E60EIlfZ-Exg,cRWazG4_egE,True,UgwPRlJVcTCZuXTYxNJ4AaABAg

Sparta trained both: women and men for excellence in many fields of service, not exactly focusing on military - yes, they were teaching strategy and when supporting allies, they often sent 1-2 men as advisers (slight change in command structure can improve existing army! Think of nation of military strategists at level of Hannibal). 
3. Argos trained their men for war. Spartans used Thermopylae as diplomatic tool and to convince others that Spartans are invincible - well, imagine you lost battle, but causing enemy to stop invasion due to high losses and low morale. It would be tempting to use this as propaganda story to not be challenged by neighbors and to conquer minor parties using stories, gossips rather than military force - according to Sun Tzu it is ideal victory ;)

So the thing about musicals that I dont think people understand is that when they start singing it's because there is so much emotion that there's nothing else for them to do but break out into dance and song. Now does this happen in real life? No of course not when they sing it's not actually happening in real life. You can take the songs and dances out of the musical and now it's just a play they add the songs and dance because it gives emotions that sometimes words alone can't express most of the time when they sing at each other it's just a conversation.,0,0,2018-10-19T00:44:37.000Z,Maddie Taylor,UC_B7HBZb7iclTSVN1mwlhyQ,Ywdj_01Jrdk,True,UgzZqTOuicwLGNDMPbp4AaABAg

"God theses movies were aweful... they were so bad and cringy... the stuff you kept counting as sins were all explained in the books.

"I was actually really excited way back in 2006 when it was announced that Rob Zombie was directing a Halloween reboot, and I really wanted it to be good and was willing to lower my expectations and give it the benefit of the doubt, but this fucking movie let me down at every damn turn, lol. The movie starts off pretty fucking terrible right out of the gate with the downright cringey breakfast scene where it's established that every character is a huge pile of shit, and after the awful ""skull fucking"" threat by the moms boyfriend I almost checked out because the dialogue in that entire opening scene is enough to make you want to leave. I realize Zombie was trying to make his own movie and all, but his interpretation of Michael's childhood was dumb af. Every single person that Michael encounters on a daily basis are full on scumbag terrible people so it's no wonder he turned into a mindless killer. After the first third of the movie it essentially becomes a full remake of the original, so the only thing Zombie did to ""make it his own movie"" was show Michael's shitty childhood, then he just remade Halloween, lol. Every scene in the asylum with kid Michael was so unrealistic. In particular the nurse scene and the rape scene. How did that woman actually become a nurse? She is incredibly unprofessional and ignorant. She is in a room with a psychopath who murdered his sister and stepfather, so let's insult him and then turn our back on him while he's eating with metal silverware, lol. She might as well have painted a target on her back. Then there are the rapist orderlies. They decided to rape a patient in the cell of a giant psycho killer, lol. What was the point of dragging that girl into Michael's cell? What made them think they were going to be able to rape this girl with Michael in the cell and the door open? This fucking movie is just full of the worst most ignorant characters and was a terrible movie because of it.

"I basically have no business rewatching this video again but just to verify, because I have no life and was dumb enough to read the graphic novels of these movies and also watched the other cartoons and red the comic books, Transformers have had several female robots. It's just that it's easier to make guy bots I guess or regular bots and just assign them as male with no breast shaped platting üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Then again they didn't have literal ball bearings aka Massive brass testicles like Fan-Favorite ‚ÄúCombiner‚Äù Transformer - Devastator who promptly got shot with a Navy Seals Super cannon/Laser cannon, that was for some reason, just floating off the coast of Northern Africa because Transformers 2 had their big fight in ancient Egypt üòÖüòµüòÇ. Anyway the one Female robot that was always in the series was Arcee (don't quote me on the spelling, pronounced Ar-see) and she got experimented on by a Decepticon (probably Shockwave) along with the robot who was spit in half and made into two racially charged (Black ‚Äúsounding"" and Dunce/Foolish) Mini-car Twins - Skids and Mudflap, let's be honest nobody was looking at Mudflap. Skid's face was basically a talking green mouse with a gold tooth and he spent more time actually in the screen shot. Moving on, Arcee was once one bot, and the experiment split her mind into 3 slightly smaller bodies, pretty much cloning. And we literally just have to assume she died like Ratchet and the other good guy/refugee Transformers in Transformers 4 or some other bullshit from Transformers 2. Because we only saw one of them take a flaming bullet to the face. The other two were pretty much fine and should've survived. It's not like they got ripped in half like Jazz in the first film. That shapeshiftig assassin girl bot would've been way cooler, to be going around killing people instead of Laser Beak who totally blew his cover killing Ken Jeong's character and then nonsensically attacking Shia LaBouf üòÇ",0,0,2018-10-18T08:34:39.000Z,Trailblazer Lazer Razer :D,UCwRhvbCHDalaHGXNC3_mJbA,4ORoPgZLeuc,True,UgzgTQpOTHPbwt_MSpR4AaABAg

Soooooooo...this also means Laurie lives near Tommy and Lindsey and the Meyers house. And Annie also lives a block or so away from Laurie. Why the HELL did Annie need to pick up Laurie and take her to Tommy's house? Were they just killing time so they could drive around and smoke weed?

"Your sin at the end for not knowing how to math in regards to Michael's age is wrong. Michael was convicted of murder and deemed insane landing him in an institution instead of prison, that takes time. 

He killed his sister at 6, but it's entirely logical to think that by the time he was put in Smith's Grove a couple years had passed.

"Points you did wrong
1. Mount Everest with batman: It's probably cheaper for the player to climb with rather as due to batman being a large figure in all.
2. freddy krueger on planet doom could be a player or a semi boss ai on the planet. For god sakes you can be master chief.
3. if you read the book wade has memorised all the artifacts and due to him being a huge fan of halliday he probably has here aswell.
4. people do not need to be walking in real life it's optional, you could probably play with a highly modified joystick or controller.
5. the girl probably has donky kong jr. because she is a gunter
6. for him playing at his job, being in it is probably his job to make money for the company. (or he was on break)
7. the curator is ogdin moro not an AI and it's definitly sarcasm that he's displeased.
8. art3mis has probably never met wade due to millions of people going into the race and thousands of servers and why she probably is in all his races is maybe due to one added the other.
9. the zemeckis cube is called that way because of it taking time 1 minute back
10: H was trying to replicate an 80s fandom with detail from the show. thats why the pepsi and coke
11. The reason it doesn't revert tim e for them is? WHY WOULD IT!
12. reason why he probably isn't suspicious is because wade in a introvert nerd living in a drug invested place with cheap caravans on top of each other for houses and he has an oasas rig. WHY WOULD HE LEAVE.
13. reason why no one else found it because THEY WERE THE FUCKING FIRST AND YOU REQUIR THE COPPER KEY TO PLAY IT.
(sorry for my use of caps it's just me signifing common sense)
14. its hard because they didn't know the dance was the clue but leap not taken gave them that clue.
15. shining probably has multiple servers unless with team or friend

"I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's coming in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hoping to find some long forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say, ""Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you""

It's gonna take a lot to take me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside, frightened of this thing that I've become

It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had

Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you

But the trees in this movie-which are clearly NOT evergreens-HAVE ALL THEIR LEAVES AND THE LEAVES HAVE NOT CHANGED COLOR!  The leaves on the ground that you see were brought in and scattered to look like it was late October in Illinois, because they were shooting in the middle of the summer, but I think John Carpenter forgot that the green trees with all their leaves would be a dead giveaway to any viewers who live in Illinois that this was definitely NOT late October!

"I believe you forgot to mention that time when Acting President Lucious Fox worked with Batman to stop President Harvey Dent who actually turned out to be supervillian.

Or that time when President Freeman worked for the CIA with a guy named Jack Ryan, (who, coincidentally is ALSO Batman... but not the same Batman?). But in previous movies, they both looked more like Darth Vader('s voice) and President Harrison Ford, who once told the bad guys to ""Get off my plane!"" But the hijackers still blew up Air Force One, and it's just lucky that Iron Man was there to rescue everyone. Wait, Batman AND Iron Man?! This movie can't decide which universe it's in: DCEU or MCU!

Anyway, after all that, President Harrison Ford married a princess and flew off in his Millennium Falcon...probably chasing down those aliens that destroyed the White House - likely on orders from Darth Vader('s voice).

Also, I'm not sure why President Lucious Fox told America that Cerberos had failed?! I'm pretty sure John McClane and Batman/Jack Ryan destroyed that asteroid.

"Theres so much wrong with this film. Love john carpenter but the older these movies get the harder it is to actually enjoy them. Theres just soo many logical flaws. Loomis is such an asshole to the nurse and grave caretaker. If he wouldve had her pull all the way up its likely michael wouldnt have gotten in the car. But every person in this film acts like they wouldnt know what to do in the real world and rightfully meet their demise. From laurie not breaking her stare but when the camera goes back to michael hes instantly gone. Nobody thinks this guy is running around, dashing behind bushes and corners of houses? Not very evil to me. Guy gets a hard on for laurie, u kno, not his sister yet, and the stupid kid doesnt even realize theres a car driving right next to him. Its the 70s, of course you would hear it. Not to mention loomis just so happening to find the red truck with a dead body next to a conveniant phone booth. You mean to tell me michael jacked loomis car and drove 150 miles back to haddonfield without ever needing gas but managed to drive somebody off the road without even a scratch on the car? The sheriff doesnt even notice a masked driver fleeing the scene of the crime but this guy cant even smell the pot his daughter was just smoking in the car he had his head inside even tho they smoked with the windows up so hes a dumbass. Not to mention the long amount of time it takes for the camera to pan out from young michael after his parents unmask him. Michael? 2 minutes later. I guess we should go see if our other kids ok too... Rob zombies remake is undoubtedly a masterpiece compared to this illogical garbage. For those who think this is a great film, i kinda feel bad for you being scared of this as a kid, must not have taken very much to freak people out back then.",0,0,2018-10-17T09:14:03.000Z,uTr0m3V1L85,UCnjJ9xXQaU0TWVEx8VteoYw,tNZSFJ3iE8g,True,UgxxKCdFplvUMOx2_Zl4AaABAg

"I know it's useless to polish this turd, but I just thought about one of the end comments that say fox didn't have the balls to have Great ape goku crushing papa Gohan. Wouldn't that have been way more interesting for people who didn't know the series and fans? I'm just picturing a scene where Gohan is explaining something important to goku, loses track of the time and the moonlight(yes, none of that eclipse bs) hits goku. The house shatters, we don't necessarily see him transform, but we see goku's perspective as he blacks out, then the great ape briefly in a third person perspective. When Goku comes too, he realizes Gohan's dead, his house is in ruins. Goku would blame piccolo, but the audience would have at least a little intrigue, and more credibility for the 'mighty ozaru' than a ton of exposition at the end. Remake with Goku as a kid, without relying on the power of boners or trying to go to school, lmao... aaaand definitely hire an Asian actor for Goku xD",0,0,2018-10-17T00:19:58.000Z,John Nelson,UC7acB7y1TLyoG-4PjwyOkVw,GzIraLLe7U8,True,UgzhX5LvBCZszr8S6DJ4AaABAg

Jason is essentially a zombie, Freddy already died, Pinhead is a demon and Chuckie isn't in a mortal body anymore, so it's pretty clear why THEY don't die. But Michael doesn't have a backstory. He's just ""psychotic killer who won't die, who knows why.""

"I would just like to say Michael Myers knowing how to drive shouldn't be a sin. I mean it's pretty common knowledge you push the gas pedal to make it go, the brake pedal to stop, and the wheel steers. And as far as I'm aware, the car was never shown to be a manual transmission, so we can assume it's an automatic, making driving the thing that much easier. 
And there seems to be some misconception that Michael wouldn't know how to drive because he is mentally the same age as when he went into the asylum. That was never established and makes no sense. He went crazy as a child. That doesn't necessarily mean his mental growth was stunted. 

On a side note you missed a sin. When Lorie looks behind the hedge where Myers was (the scene at 7:08), you can see John Carpenter's cigarette smoke waft into frame. *DING*",0,0,2018-10-16T23:12:08.000Z,Michael Wolfe,UCn8tJjt-MgaJp-qc-xVXL0Q,tNZSFJ3iE8g,True,Ugxy92dy1lI872jtKeh4AaABAg

"Things people keep saying in the comments to defend dinosaurs in warfare:

""The indoraptor's better because you can run out of bullets""  
By that logic, every platoon should bring a tiger with them, ""just in case."" If an army can't supply sufficient ammunition to its troops, how are they going to feed (lots of fresh meat, not MREs), transport, conceal, and recapture a ten foot dinosaur in the field? You'd run out of dinosaurs before you run out of bullets.

""A dinosaur's faster and stealthier and won't give away your position like a gun will""
Faster than 3,000 feet per second? Basic concealment will protect a shooter's position while a large dinosaur would have to run to its target (the laser would give away your position) while exposed to enemy fire. Also, at its size, it can't access all the places a human can.

""There is something called a bulletproof vest so a gun won't work.""
There is and they do. Body armor is nothing new and weapons have always evolved to meet the challenge. ""Bulletproof vests"" are actually ""bullet resistant"" having limitations and don't cover the whole body. If the .50 isn't able penetrate something, it's a safe bet a biting animal wouldn't do any better.

Tanks, jets, drones, satellite-guided rockets, heat-seeking missiles, armored vehicles... I'm unconvinced a dinosaur would be an improvement.",25,2,2018-10-16T16:35:29.000Z,J.R.'s Offbeat Art,UCsGD1ADiNgXjUCvkAhptIbg,cRWazG4_egE,True,UgwS5xS_JqS_wcDxYfF4AaABAg

"Right off the bat : I didnt see this movie. But it seems to me both the movie and CinemaSins are HUGELY overestimating the risk of a dozen or so (heck, even a hundred) dinosaurs getting free. 
It is remotely possible that the smallest and least interesting ones may become a pest, as there may be more than 1 specimen and they could reproduce and well.. we know from experience what alien (i.e. not native to the environment they¬¥re in) species can do to a place.
However, 1 T-Rex on the lose ? So freaking what? It cant make new T-Rexes and it¬¥s too small to hide. The only reason these dinos are ever a threat in these (all terrible except the first) movies is because the people are untrained, have little to no weaponry and find themselves in a jungle environment. Any country on earth would be able to quickly dispatch police (yes, NOT army) forces that could take out any size dinosaur on land. It¬¥s called firearms. Especially in ¬¥murica, the average redneck¬¥s household should have enough artillery to remove any but the biggest - for those, some high caliber guns may be required, but it wouldnt be a challenge.

I would concede that sea and to some extent flying creatures (they¬¥re not dinosaurs, by the by) could be potentially dangerous... if they were able to spread and find nourishment. Which, funnily enough, would rarely if ever be humans. That really big one? Yeah, he may endanger some wales, but wouldnt give any fuck about something as small as a human.",0,0,2018-10-16T15:39:05.000Z,narsil1984,UCiKz7ddGRnpjbeDMgg0G1rQ,cRWazG4_egE,True,Ugwrl4SW5LvBdsJZHsV4AaABAg

"That volcano scene at the beginning made me so mad for so many reasons. They had one volcano that was the size and shape of a stratavolcano (highly explosive, chunky hard lava) but it was erupting shieldvolcano lava (liquid and flowing lava). Lava that liquidy can‚Äôt build up enough pressure in the magma chamber for an explosion like that, so the whole eruption was just stupid. Then there‚Äôs the fact that if a volcano did erupt that way (like a stratavolcano), EVERYONE ON THE ISLAND WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD. An eruption like that releases gasses into the air that will suffocate you in minutes, not to mention that all that ‚Äúash‚Äù is actually tiny shards of glass, stone, obsidian, and other things that will rip up your lungs the minute you inhale. Anyone within ten miles of that island would‚Äôve been in danger, anyone actually on the island when it erupted would have been dead for sure. You can‚Äôt just outrun the lava and be fine, that scene when they‚Äôre on the beach and the volcano is erupting and they think they‚Äôre fine cause there‚Äôs no lava, I was like ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre still breathing shards of glass and poison gassed!!‚Äù",0,0,2018-10-16T05:13:21.000Z,Keep it Random,UCLiZiTJ2Ic3NVJCMu2B_ISg,cRWazG4_egE,True,UgxS2R3o0SQne33RqPt4AaABAg
