"Other than the deep-seeded lifelong fear of bridges that “Beetlejuice” gave me, I think you’re giving the titular character too much credit. He is neither the hero nor the main character, he’s that devil you realize too late you didn’t need to make a deal with. That’s the whole point - the married ghosts think they need to haunt the Deets out of their home instead of co-existing, and only after they call on Betelgeuse do they realize what a horrible mistake it was, especially of how he treats Lydia, who they’ve become very fond of. Trust me, I do NOT like Tim Burton’s work of essentially the last 20 years, to say he’s a one-trick hack is an understatement, but I think you analyzed “Beetlejuice”  incorrectly.",0,0,2018-09-23T16:11:21.000Z,Meredith Hagan,UCQd0DKwgfaAHBsRKihLg8nw,inXrIYr2V_U,True,UgwAh-J26_K4FBjPey14AaABAg

"Your opinion is valid but I don’t agree with most of your criticism. I do agree that suburban sets is an indicator he wants the strange and gothic more accepted not rebelling. Also ed wood is my least favorite next to Charlie chocolate factory. Just because they were badly done and portrayed. And I agree that Betelgeuse is the truly creepy character of any burton movie because of the underlying sexual douche vibe. But I disagree that Betelgeuse is celebrated cause of a toy or child like qualities. The movie is celebrated because just like nightmare before Christmas and Edward Scissor hands it addresses adult issues in a more family friendly way. Even as a kid I knew Betelgeuse was a bad man. Also you missed the whole point of Edward scissor hands. The whole point was that most ‘normal’ people will accept the strange and unusual if it serves them an advantage. Like when he was doing peoples topiary, hair cuts, and being an Avon test subject. But when they are done with him they still think him a freak and when he no longer serves a purpose for them he is driven out of town mob style. It was also a nod to the classic tale of Frankenstein’s monster. If you really want to get to know burton on an intimate level and really admire his work honestly and openly I suggest you watch his film ‘Big Fish’ as much as I love his dark sets and boyish humor Big Fish is the serious side of burton. As serious as it gets. It strips away his dark love of gothic set design and costume as well as a kooky soundtrack and in place there is a southern folk lore tale of how family can be broken and only fixed by opening our minds and hearts to each other. It’s a movie about story telling and how all stories have an element of truth.

"If a child goes to see Infinity War with their father (whom are they are stuck in an abusive relationship with) and is upset because Gamora is sacrificed by Thanos then what does it matter?
That child has far bigger things to worry about, like, getting out of the horrible real life situation. Should film makers be forced to make films that cater to the 0.003%? The film does not treat this as a healthy relationship not only because it ends in her death but because Gamora and Nebula try and kill their father on multiple occasions. I believe that this film could help children open their eyes to the abusive situation they are in and show how important it is that they get out. 

Thanos is not _really_ rewarded for sacrificing Gamora, for a start it hurts him a lot, more then almost everything else he suffers through in the film. Then at the end he admits that although he accomplished his goal it was a high price:
Thanos: Daughter.
Young Gamora: Did you do it?
Thanos: Yes.
Young Gamora: What did it cost?
Thanos: ...Everything.

In the real world people are abused by those who love them all the time. It's sad, but it happens. The message of that scene is not that Abuse = Love but that horrible people can abuse someone whilst still loving them especially if they are as twisted as Thanos.

"I don't like the whole prosthetics = bad narrative in SW and I wish they didn't use it in TLJ. (I generally have mixed feelings about TLJ tbh)

Also I prefer to read Luke's decision in TESB as naive but ultimately the right one. I think Yoda and Obi-Wan were wrong and the movies demonstrate that they were wrong. They were ready to give up on the fight before Luke and Leia showed up and even when they agree to help Luke they try to control him and Yoda especially has no faith in Luke at all and his teaching methods rely on humiliating his student constantly. 

This is why it annoys me that they made Yoda the voice of reason in TLJ. I feel like Luke is the one who should have realised his own mistakes and ghost Yoda would have been pissed that Luke wasn't continuing the tradition properly and that Rey was dark-side-curious. Yoda has always represented the Jedi tradition in the movies, he's a conservative, even though he's a good guy and a spiritual teacher. 

I don't mind Luke being flawed, he's always been flawed. What I hate is when the movie portrays bad authority figures as good and wise. Like Yoda and, yes, Holdo (yeah I don't really enjoy all the Holdo hatred online but she's not especially wise or reasonable the way she's framed, she's just sort of okay. She makes decisions that make sense in her situation and within her framework, that's all.

"How she became Hellcat was a little more complicated than that.  Patsy married her sweetheart Buzz Baxter who became an Air Force officer and volunteered for a top secret experiment trying to recreate the Super Soldier serum, the experiment was partially successful making Buzz mildly superhuman but also psychotic and he became the villain Mad Dog.  Trying to stop the project and save her estranged husband Patsy found this special costume previously owned by Greer Grant (now known as Tigra) which seemed to grant her enhanced physical abilities and she briefly joined the Avengers to take them down.  Over time the costumes powers somehow moved into her.  Initially her powers were just enhanced agility and reflexes (like a high end acrobat and athlete but without the need for advanced training), she later married Damon Hellstrom (the Son of Satan), went insane due to his family tree and died.

"I think this analysis is interesting but missing context from the 80s 

1. Beetlejuice was always a villain. However there was a trend in the 80s of making kid toys from R-rated movies that are actually innapropiate and got criticized even then but were totally a thing. See the Robocop cartoon or the fact that a Robocop cartoon even exists. Same thing with Predator and other violent things. The doll should be considered in that context of desperately trying to make a quick buck.

2. Tim Burton was never considered a serious director. Good to look at, yes. Entertaining, yes. But I thought everyone already knew, even in the 80s, that he was Hot Topic edgy before there was even a Hot Topic. I mean, true rebellious rebels dont get handed the Batman blockbuster. I dont think he's a hack but its like being offended that McDonald's is no longer fine dining when it never was. Of course the writers didn't care about an accurate description of depression, it was a big flashy summer blockbuster from the go. Its only now that people seem to want more meaning out of what was always a popcorn film 

3. I always thought Ed dressing like a woman to the Baptist was him having a nervous breakdown in a low key way not necessarily the actions of a complete idiot

4. Is Ed Scissorhands basically an immortal child? Would he be able to process that all the people he knew are dead or dying?

5. Dark Shadows and the Alice movies are so bad but it's only doing what he always did, but more tired.

6. Man Tim Burton as Hot Topic avatar is so apt. All his stuff is for suburban kids playing at edgy. It was never authentic edge so to speak",1,0,2018-07-18T12:17:35.000Z,test subject,UC0gy03mteRj7iYtC-yHvR5w,inXrIYr2V_U,True,UgzCEWk5Y2_ydi11Bk54AaABAg
"Ehhhhhh... this kind of content worries me... I like what I've seen of your personality, but this feels like you are taking unintentional allegories deserving of consideration & discussion, and transforming it into a false or flawed narrative to serve your central thesis.
This can have a dangerous effect on the populous that can't understand how you are manipulating symbolism and pop ideals, or other nuance in the subject.

If you do it well, you might be able to do the Lindsay Ellis thing and flirt with the line - done poorly, well, I'd really prefer to not see you become another Anita Sarkeesian.

Also, as with all content creators on YouTube.  
When you start going ""high-concept"" please ""take a fucking breath"" in your cuts. 
 Editing such that you are powering through your script, into a flawless read getting to your next point as fast as possible doesn't allow many of your audience to digest your concepts and contexts without multiple viewings, especially if they are less familiar with any of the words you use or the context you are using them in.
It's becoming one of my biggest Pet Peeves with this kind of video.
You're not the worst offender, there are some good breaks in there, but there is also no breath in between many of the cuts and sentences, and I've experienced too many of the issue to have a greater tolerance for it.

If he won dominion over the universe, in classic villain form, the argument would hold more water, in his case, but he was pursuing a cold calculation he thought would save the universe. I must point out I completely agree that Thanos was a very, very bad father: abusive, distant, unconcerned with his children's emotional wellbeing. I just don't agree that the movie is saying it's okay that he's a bad dad.",0,0,2018-07-14T02:04:46.000Z,Terence Bradshaw,UCPXqWImCOxPAEVnIQBa7oJw,aJ0nAkXOkMs,True,UgxcNkuXUnZFkuuRYj14AaABAg
"I remember as a queer kid growing up in a very traditional Hispanic family that Tim Burton was an outlet for me to not only come to terms with my outsider status in society, but within my own family as well. I did a rewatch of Burton's films a while ago when Miss Perguine's was announced. Surprise surprise, the film was as safe and sanitized as his previous films are (with the added insult of ruining a good YA novel) and only brought to light just how shallow his treatment of ""otherness"" is and how naive/undeveloped his worldview really is. I'm really glad I came across this video and I'm so grateful you put into words just what had bothered me so much about his work. All the same though, I can't deny the help his films were to me as a kid and how they still hold a great amount of value to me.

"I thought all the Thanos stuff was pretty obvious.  That's why they made him the villain.  He loves Gamora, but it's a toxic type of love.  Yes, Thanos is weirdly framed as the protagonist of Infinity War, but the whole film we know his morals are wrong.  What makes it such a powerful story is we know he's wrong, but he wins and we're left with a Universe that fell victim to extremely flawed logic.  So while Thanos did love Gamora, we're shown by the protagonists that this kind of love isn't healthy.
Man of Steel also knows Pa Kent is a bad dad.  That's the point of his character.  Clark deciding to be Superman is him overcoming the bad advice he grew up with and becoming his own person.  We're supposed to disagree with Pa Kent.
Also I think the whole God/Father got a bit reversed.

"I think Tim Burton was the first director I actively saw as ""a director"" in the same way i saw pixar and disney as ""a studio"". Burtons movies really helped me start getting into cinema, especially into german expressionism and early hammer horror, which led me to explore more and more genres and directors, until i finally decided to study moviemaking. now, with a few years of film studies under my belt, i can see most of these movies and noticed some really ugly messages. Ive noticed the most ridiculously historically incongruous parts of Ed Wood, grown to almost despise Big Fish romantization of this white american ""heaven"", and i cannot watch any penguin or beetlejuice scenes in Batman or Beetlejuice (though i do love Burtons blandest characters like the Beetlejuice dead couple, mostly because they have a tenderness that had always been very appealing to me). Thats without even mentioning his newer movies (like Dark Shadows and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). And, even further, a very well documented history of cultural meaning being tweaked or deleted in his movies (from the harry belafonte and oogie boogie stuff, to the jewish erasure in corpse bride and miss peregrine). I dont think ill ever shake off the nostalgia factor of his earlier movies, and theres a couple i still remember very fondly (the two first animated ones, which apparently have the least bit of intervention from him). But its very important for one to keep ones childhoods under check, critically analyse them and, when creating, being able to see the mistakes so as to not repeat them. I think those are things that Burton never managed to do.",3,0,2018-07-11T17:34:48.000Z,Casi R.,UCB09MSVTDSj2bt67JB5k0pw,inXrIYr2V_U,True,UgzP_QFgRLniWCoF_2d4AaABAg

"I'm not sure if you can really discuss Gandalf as daddy without talking about his secret-keeping, ""i'm putting you on this adventure for your own good"", manipulative streak in The Hobbit.

I don't think that's entirely absent in LotR as well. I seriously doubt Gandalf thought anyone else would be capable of taking the Ring from Rivendell to Mt Doom. It's like Thanos on Planet Whatever. He brings Frodo there, doesn't give him full information, the council foreseeably breaks down into bickering. Frodo at least consents to the sacrifice unlike Gamora, but it ain't informed consent.

"I don't agree entirely with all the points made here but it's a fantastic video. 

Correct me if I'm wrong but I feel as though you feel a fatherly figure who is also a villain should not be represented as anything other than clearly evil. Historical villains are rarely black and white and often gain power through a manipulation of heroic and  relatable traits. They take advantage of the misguided and miseducated to leverage power. In more recent times examples would be Brexit in Europe which was predicated largely on the idea that immigrants were to blame for societal woes. A similar thing currently echoed in Trumps America. Thanos represents the terrorist, a person dangerously fanatical in their beliefs and is intelligent enough convince others of his plight. This is an important and relevant restyling of the typical villain.

The film demonstrates the importance of recognizing such demagogues. Thanos being 'rewarded' is the point, he finds what he seeks but at what cost?  it has ringings of Mobby Dick and The Heart of Darkness.

In terms of demonstrating good fatherly figures I don't think we should strive for some faux idea of what constitutes an ideal father as though there is such a thing. I fear this could perpetuate unrealistic ideas of both masculinity and father much the same way body shaming promotes unreasonable expectations of self image.

I also think we should be careful of how we view leadership roles within the familial setting and not assume anything resembling a patriarchal structure is a negative structure. Relationships and leadership roles are complicated and complex and I suspect most don't fit within typical patriarchal or matriarchal structures. 

What I think is missing in film  is a more diverse range of characteristion. There seems to be a rigid adherence to ideas set out at the beginning of the medium. I want better more diverse representation. Keep the shitty fathers, keep the ditsy blond, keep the token black guy but for pete's sake let's offset that by including characters that smash those stereotypes!

"I'm re-watching ""Lord of the Rings"" after having the read the books to compare- and it did occur to me how focused the characters are on lineage and the power implicitly conveyed through as much.  While I prefer the movies in most ways, I have to respond in the clip of Gimli's racist reaction to the elves in my disappointment that the Peter Jackson movies diminished his character so.  In the book 2 of the ""Fellowship of the Ring"", Gimli actually has a rather glorious moment where elves are treating him as an inferior, letting Legolas walk unimpeded whilst Gimli must be blindfolded. His response is to call them out on their hierarchical thinking.  Legolas becomes flustered that Gimli would dare speak up about the discrimination, for in the books, it is actually Legolas who is slow to let go of his belief in elves being the top of the hierarchy.

In response to the point about Frodo, I agree and would go a step further- for his own part of LOTR, he consistently tries to uplift others.  Samwise is always subservient to him, referring to himself as little more than the Baggins' gardener.  Frodo responds by reaffirming that they are equals who push each other on.  Likewise, Frodo sees in Gollum not as a servant but a possible peer whose struggles is not dissimilar to his own.",1,1,2018-07-11T01:09:05.000Z,Kevin Lee,UCkfOimFyj4whJv1SCareJ5Q,8DzSRkV_lTw,True,UgyQMehUruX_IEyBpW54AaABAg

"I think one of the best dads I've seen in a modern (ish... is 2008 still modern?) Hollywood blockbuster was John Goodman's Pops Racer in Speed Racer. He loves his sons and supports them, but pushed his first son away when his protectiveness turned into controlling. But he learned from that, and when he realized he'd started heading down that same path with his second son, he decided to instead support him and tell him how much he loved him.

I'm not a dad, but as a son who's known a dad for my whole life, he seems like a pretty realistic portrayal of a loving father. He's neither the perfect patriarchal figure who knows everything, nor the abusive asshole we're supposed to not notice is an abusive asshole. He's a guy who wants to do what's right for his kids but doesn't always know what that is because parenting isn't an exact science.

"I'm not sure The Phantom Menace tries to skirt around the whole flawed parental figures issue as much as you make it out. I guess my first quibble is that I've never taken the ""there was no father"" line to literally mean Anakin is a virgin birth. I know nobody agrees with me on this, and that's fine, but I think Shmi is just saying that she raised Anakin on her own. His dad was never part of the picture, and it's not really any of Qui-Gon's business. Point two (and the one that I think actually matters): Anakin definitely has flawed father figures in that movie (and the whole prequel trilogy for that matter). The fact that the council puts such an emphasis on suppressing your emotions is a big reason why he ends up becoming Vader. Considering how expression of emotion is usually viewed in men and women respectively, I think the fact that the prequels tell the story of boy who is taken from his mother and then raised by a bunch of men who tell him emotions - even something as simple as loving his mom - will turn him to the dark side, a story where the only Jedi who showed Anakin any compassion in the entirety of the Phantom Menace dies before the movie is over leaving him in the hands of people like Mace Windu (Obi-Wan eventually grows to love Anakin, but definately not in Episode I, and BOY do they have a bad relationship in Episode II), means it's a little more critical of male authority figures and toxic masculinity that you make it out to be.

"Very good video, as always. I somewhat disagree with your dismissal of Yoda not wanting to train Luke because it avoids the question of 'why did Yoda say Luke was too old'. Yoda isn't avoiding to train Luke because he fears what might happen, but he knows that he has a greater chance of falling. Luke should have been trained at a young age and already formed attachments, which is why he almost falls in Return of the Jedi after Vader mentions that he might turn Leia instead. It's only when Luke notices that he's becoming his father does he act nonviolently. Arguably, if Luke had not noticed that, he would have fallen. And Yoda still trains Luke after another father figure begs him to do it, so meh. And it's mentioned why it exists in Phantom Menace that attachments lead to etc that leads to the Dark Side.",1,3,2018-07-10T20:29:22.000Z,ִ,UC369tuuB7o1e-5zv4v4Fz4g,8DzSRkV_lTw,True,UgzXk4RAAn9CNjmZNop4AaABAg

"If it's alright, I have a question:
Earlier in the video, you express that Luke refuses to train Rey as a means of exerting control over her. Later on, you stated that Yoda refuses to train Luke because he feared what would happen as a result. Are the two separate somehow? Is one an assertion of control rather than the other? I always thought Luke was terrified of failure again, so he refused to even engage in the process anymore.

"I had two abusive parents. My mother was more on the neglectful, emotionally abusive side, but my father is a straight up asshole. Bigoted and physically & sexually abusive.

I never really had parental figures growing up. I always felt alone. Unsupported. I developed suicidal depression and social anxiety because of it. Despite being 24, I still feel like a child.

My mom asked me a couple months ago what could have possibly caused my depression. I reminded her of when she beat me for getting an F. How when my depression first started to get bad in middle school, she accused me of throwing pity parties. How after my first suicide attempt, she kept calling me a coward. Of when dad used to hold me down and touch and tickle me. Of how they both to screamed at me for not cleaning. Of how it was only after Dad was mean to her that she divorced him.

She turned away and pretended she didn't hear me.

"I'm eagerly awaiting part 2!  My own 2 cents is that I don't think Dads should necessarily be portrayed as 'perfect' on film because people are fundamentally flawed. I think this is what they were alluding to in Man of Steel, Clark ultimately takes the hero journey against his Dads wishes. I think it's definitely easy to pick out bad Dads and good Dads and there is certainly always room for better representation in films but I also feel it can be damaging to perceptions of masculinity that fathers should be unfaltering paragons of wise council. In reality relationships are extremely diverse and this can have a profound impact both good and bad on an individual .

We have to be careful that the message we are sending out the next generation is that there is this thing called the 'ideal Dad'. Especially for men who have struggled with adhering to outdated ideas of stoic machismo so much that mental illness and suicide are at tragically high levels.

"I tried to write a comment a few ways, but I had so many thoughts at the same time, so much in the video resonated with me, surprised me, annoyed me that I honestly couldn't put it in a coherent way that would not be the length of a book.

I'll settle for saying - great analysis. Gave me a lot of ""huh... that makes sense"" moments, a few moments where I was half-ready to disagree, then a moment later I was like ""no, wait. That actually makes perfect sense"".

I enjoy Burton movies, but I think people do miss many things this video points out. Heck, I've missed those, and I always thought Burton's movies were more about style and visuals and were mostly skin-deep with their ""subversive"" vibe (so, yeah, basically candy).

What's interesting is that I realised that, despite often not liking stories that claim they have no ""politics"" or ""message"" (while being, in fact, very strongly about a message praising normalcy and status quo), I was always willing to give Burton's films a free pass and dismiss some troubling implications to that effect. Still not really sure why. I think popular culture in the 80s was just starved for anything that'd not go with the flow, even on the superficial, shallow level. It's not great for weird girls dressed in black to have someone in movies who merely *looks* like them, but I suppose for some, it was better than having nothing?

By the way, and I'm straying off topic here - there's one long-running franchise that kinda is what Burton movie fans often *wish* his movies could be. Shows/movies about the Addams Family, especially earlier ones. It's about weird, spooky people (complete with the visual part), but it's also about playing with expectations in a genuine manner. The Addamses are genuinely nice people and friendly to others, they're just... off and doing their own thing. The people they meet are often assholes because they're judgmental and awful beyond the pleasant surface. And Gomez and Morticia are easily the best married couple ever shown on screen. It's 2018, and you are still hard pressed to find a fictional married couple that's passionate *and* respect each other. They are portrayed in a very sex-positive way, and the first TV series featuring them appeared more than 50 years ago. Couples portrayed like this are still a rarity and kinda forward. Fifty years ago, such a portrayal was arguably decades ahead its time. This frank portrayal of a couple that cares about each other (and are not portrayed as chaste to the point of being sexless) was genuinely subversive and somewhat extreme at the time, and honestly is even now.

Which is to say, that's exactly what Burton movies could be, and what they are perceived as being. A couple (and a whole family) that's creepy, weird, completely ""off"", but not bad because of it, and contrasted with people who are not ""off"", but are honestly kinda shitty compared to them. Burton characters often have the trappings of such characters, but not the heart.",10,0,2018-06-19T11:47:40.000Z,Michael Sporzynski,UCSANYlTmX74-gjXljHIpCCg,inXrIYr2V_U,True,Ugw75w2Lx6syGW03sS54AaABAg
"""Abuse is love."" Yes, that's one message that could be interpreted by children and adults. However, moviegoers aren't passive viewers. They take their past experiences and knowledge to make meaning of the images and narratives that a movie bombards them with. They also don't perceive messages in silo, rather, in relation to the many other messages within the film. We can only guess what viewers take away (sometimes those guesses are correct if we share the same cultural experiences and visual codes). I would agree that the relationship between Thanos and Gamora equates to abuse is love, yet, the viewer never identifies with Thano's cause to justify his abuse and killing of Gamora. We know from the get-go he's the villain, and in our culture, we might admire the villain, but never root for him, or think he's right, even when he's a made an empathetic character. That said, this is changing. Breaking Bad has ushered in a bad is good mentality across television and film (the anti-hero), making clear why we glamorize oppressive daddy figures -- you can't get what you really want by doing the right thing. We live vicariously through these characters because they do what deep down inside we might desire to do, but are too honest and moral to do (hopefully).

"This video essay very much suffer from the ""let's have this idea and try to fit things inside"" mindset, having not seen anything from DC besides Man of Steel I can't comment on it but the MCU very much urges his protagonits to get away from their father influence, Iron Man, Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy 1 & 2, are about that, even Spider-Man Homecoming, where Tony Stark is presented as one of the least objectionable father figure in the MCU is very much about encouraging Peter to be his own man and not follow in Tony's footsteps. Captain America civil war is about escaping the influence of a overbearing government represented by an actually abusive father (Ross) who has a toxic manipulative relationship with his daugter in the Incredible Hulk. That's why your video kind of feels disingenious, pretty much all the movies point clearly in one direction and you're trying to pretend they don't to fit a pre-prepared narrative. As for Thanos, besides the fact that he is VERY MUCH the bad guy in the story and thus isn't supposed to be taken as a positive exemple (protagonist does not equal hero, that's basic storytelling) the ""universe rewarded him"" does not make sens. You assume that the universe has morals or ethical ideas, the universe is not god, it does not reward the good and punishes the bad, it's completly infantile to think that way. It sets rules and you can choose to follow them or not, Thanos followed the stone rule, he sacrificed what he loved (at least according to his own view on love) and got what he wanted, simple as that.",1,0,2018-06-18T17:25:33.000Z,Catllifrey,UCG35Ho2n5_7I0VvykotRVCg,aJ0nAkXOkMs,True,UgxkpyvUJtMC6MM3aYl4AaABAg

"In 1998 I was 19 years old. I enjoyed Beetlejuice when it came out, but it was never supposed to be any great counter-culture icon or anything. It was a completely mainstream comedy, as are *all* Burton's movies. I think the whole problem here is that Maggie has gotten the impression Burton was supposed to be some kind of art-house ""alternative"" director, but that's never been the case *at all*. He's always been completely mainstream, just with an obvious quirky visual aesthetic. And a very limited one at that - everything he does is the same, and has always been the same.

I wonder how Maggie got so confused in the first place? Just because someone is described as an 'auteur' doesn't mean their work is counter-cultural. Lots of auteurs make completely mainstream films in a unique way. That's all Burton is. I've never heard him described as anything more than that.",0,0,2018-06-18T02:21:46.000Z,Taniwha_NZ,UCy3Nw50lfTm1cUlHesd85Pg,inXrIYr2V_U,True,UgwjgQDSml8zZwtoDbp4AaABAg

"I've heard this take about Infinity War conflating love with abuse, and while I have many problems with the film, and the Thanos Gomorra dynamic, I'm not sure it actually does this. The construction of the sacrifice is that THANOS must give up what THANOS loves most. Yes, we all know that from an outside perspective and certainly from Gomorra's perspective, the relationship is an extremely abusive one. But it's quite clear that Thanos believes what he feels for Gomorra is love, and since is is Thanos who must make the sacrifice, that's all that matters from the Soul Stone perspective. 

It is quite possible for a person to genuinely love someone but still be an abusive monster, and indeed to characterize their abuse as a symbol of their love. Gomorra even challenges this when she realizes how deranged calling their relationship ""love"" is. To say otherwise is to suggest something not only untrue, but dangerous: that for something to be abuse, the ABUSER must define it as such, rather than the one who receives the abuse.

My sister and I grew up under a very abusive father, and the characterization of an abuser as one who views oneself as the one willing to make the hard choices, that hurts their children to help them and genuinely loves them despite being their tormentor is a very accurate one, and I never once felt like the film was asking me to see their relationship as anything but the monstrous tragedy that it was. 

I did however feel like the film was asking me to sympathize with Thanos' worldview, which I do have some big issues with.

What's interesting is that I DID feel like a certain film was asking me to view an abusive relationship favorable, and that is Yondo is GotG2. I think people went way too easy on that film's handling of an abusive father.",5,0,2018-06-18T00:14:59.000Z,The Following is a Test,UCZIhXzzYoHNhBibo1P0xSFA,aJ0nAkXOkMs,True,UgzyDTDuTR-2gqcGa-B4AaABAg

"Interesting video, and cool set. You did get me thinking on why I love Beetlejuice and put simply it's because of two reasons. 1. I love a good anti-hero. 2. I never saw Lydia as a joke even remotely. To me, the film was cool because it was the first time I saw someone who is clearly the villain forced, or convinced to do the right thing. Before trying to marry Lydia, Beetlejuice did save the sweet couple and rid the home of the pompous guest. A villain doing the right thing if only for his own purposes.
Also, Lydia was someone I didn't connect personally, but I did feel for her as I do most of Burton's characters. I feel for these outcast because it's not about them rebelling against the system but being different from the system and being excepted anyway. Lydia gets her happy ending because by the end she has two sweet people cut from a suburban cloth (much like Edward's story) who love her just the way she is. In Charlie, Wonka is that outcast and Charlie is his accepter. Tim's films give hope to the thought that maybe you can be different and still find acceptance among the cookie cutter types.

"For me , even as a child, beetlejuice was a manifestation of everything horrible about inmaturity, a selfish guy that doesn't know personal space or boundaries, is proud of his discrimination against the living, doesn't take anything seriously and enjoys the humiliation of others. For the most part the things I didn't like from other kids and didn't like about myself, even if sometimes I was excited about his enormous powers (that were basically annoy everyone).
And he is defeated by a normal couple that at the start of the film want to have a son and be a family and at the end they are able to create that with their new adoptive daughter Lydia who they decide to protect from this edgy kid's fantasy, and to do that, they gave up their own desires of kiking the Deetz out of the house.
And for me as a kid that was a positive message about how a save family environment could defeat the worst parts of inmaturity.
And it also could be read as if the director, Burton, was finally trying to defeat those feelings that wanted to annoy his parents by accepting his life with them as something good. But that is just an opinion and the idea I have about the film as a kid.

"The conflict in Tim Burton's films (or his better films, at least) seems to be between nonconformists who wish for inclusion in society and nonconformists who wish to dismantle society. Lydia Deetz and Bruce Wayne may feel out of place, but they're willing to defend the status quo against Beetlejuice and the Joker because the villains' disruption of social norms exceeds what Burton deems as an acceptable disruption. In fact, Lydia even finds herself in tension with her stepmother because of the latter's desire to destroy the quaint charm of the house with her Expressionistic art, and the Joker's ""homicidal art"" poses a similar threat for reasons beyond ""Murder is bad."" 

The ideal world for Burton is one in which the ""strange and unusual"" is incorporated into the middle class American dream, not offered as a replacement for it. If anything, John Waters would be an antagonist in a Tim Burton film--an artist whose diversity is disruptive to cultural norms rather than a quirky complement to them. Perhaps that's why Burton has mainstream appeal: he's asking to be invited to the party and accepted as he is rather than questioning if his outsider status reflects an inherent problem with the party itself. He views inclusion as something that's hindered primarily by internal social anxiety and only secondarily by external gatekeeping, or at the very least he wants to imagine a fantasy world where that's the case, where he'd be loved if only he were brave enough to put himself out there. (And maybe his success has largely fulfilled that fantasy for him.)",13,1,2018-06-17T21:05:01.000Z,M.A. Moreno,UCNUCuWNA06lKvOauv6PmL-Q,inXrIYr2V_U,True,Ugw3c_R1teaRrUEXEV14AaABAg

"From my perspective on Infinity War: Gamorra rejects the notion that Thanos' abuse made her strong. Thanos is never presented as a good dad, he's presented as a villain who would rather use ultimate power to kill half the universe than save all of it. He's compelling, but that doesn't make him a good person. And he got the Soul Gem because he DOES love Gamorra, as many abusers DO love their victims, but that love is twisted and wrong. But it's still love. The movie's not sending the message that abuse=love, it's telling you that Thanos is twisted, but that the universe isn't judging his actions, it's judging his heart. The universe (or whatever is keeping the Soul Gem) kind of sucks because the real-life universe sucks on a cosmic level.

That having been said: I can get behind any essay about daddies that examines them from multiple angles, and I definitely agree that it's a lazy shorthand, even if I still enjoy it. I won't many more times.

"In defense of Infinity War, which is a movie that I genuinely loved, having Gamora shout ""this isn't love"" provides the audience with a spark of doubt about Thanos' feelings.  I think you can interpret it as Thanos believing wholeheartedly that he truly loves her, even though it seems obvious that it he doesn't love anyone but himself.

Then again, that's not really a strong counter-argument, and all the evidence points to the idea that this is just another sign of the toxicity of our patriarchal society.

"While I wholeheartedly agree with the disturbing nature of Pa Kent's message, I  also think you can't 100% predict how a viewer will interpret a message, scene, or dialogue in film. Though the hypothetical bit about a young girl in an abusive relationship with her father having normalized the horrendous actions of a comic book villain is a disturbingly possible scenario, the remedy to that wouldn't be to take away a characters like Thanos who I think is ultimately an ambitious antagonist who they did a pretty ok job of humanizing. The films ending can attest to that and is ambitious in its own right. You may also not be giving viewers enough credit, as a character, who is transparently the film's antagonist; and someone we're already hard-wired to side against based on the rules of narrative, Thanos is still clearly the villain if you think long enough about it. Anyone who comes out of this film thinking Thanos is the hero or that his  likely already struggles with their own understanding of morality,. Should the film take on the responsibility of how some may interpret this when all those choices are what they consciously chose to make a compelling villain?",0,0,2018-06-17T06:48:39.000Z,Solomon Henderson,UC6G5pgRrw-gv5RR7nSbxVZw,aJ0nAkXOkMs,True,Ugx9yyJu6UiMj4aIu6F4AaABAg

i like tim burton but ive mainly only watched his more recent movies, most of which are adaptations and while i like them i feel like he has a tendency to change things in ways that are weird and kind of stupidish, like do we really need a wonka backstory or to turn alice in wonderland into a weird harry potter quest movie or whatever the fuck happened to the end of miss peregrines
i like the movies (even through the looking glass and miss peregrines) and they look visually excellent but i think there were some really weird choices made that make them kind of bad as adaptations and i never really got much of a message from any of them other than a basic ""embrace your weirdness its ok to be yourself"" and some feminism i guess in the alice movies",0,1,2018-06-17T05:42:06.000Z,Jacob Swihart,UCqwbMxKPg4c2lycnh1FloFw,inXrIYr2V_U,True,UgyvQC-VfmWP55BvxqJ4AaABAg

"In previous generations superheroes didn't have ""daddy issues"" because they WERE ""Daddy"". George Reeves in THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN TV show and Adam West in the 60s BATMAN, were surrogate fathers to  a generation of kids who's fathers were either killed in World War II and Korea or emotionally distant because of PTSD.  The versions of Superman played by Reeves and Batman played by West weren't just strong, they were  warm, kind, taught valuable lessons about good morals and also had a sense of humor. Except for the first episode their was never any mention of their parents in either series. They were adults. The next versions were ""sons"". SUPERMAN THE MOVIE had Christopher Reeve's Superman with two fathers, his real father Jor-El played by Marlon Brando and his adopted human one Jonathan Kent who dies of a heart attack. Jor-El is depicted like God sending his son to save mankind. In Tim Burton's BATMAN Bruce Wayne is a neurotic because he was orphaned as a child and is taken care of by his butler and surrogate father Alfred. Superman and Batman were now sons either obeying or avenging their fathers.It continues to this day with most superheroes being sons and daughters except Captain America, Doctor Strange and Hawkeye.",0,0,2018-06-17T04:32:03.000Z,Mokkari77,UCk0BFVbKRn3jsxLXk98X1SQ,aJ0nAkXOkMs,True,UgwiQPq94p-jUfYyQ8x4AaABAg

"Two dad related things, both of them tv shows, but still. First I love Fringe, and the whole show is about the incredibly far, and usually over reaching, lengths parents, fathers specifically in that case will go for their children. What's interesting about that is in all cases the show makes you sympathize with the dads but also doesn't forgive them for the consequences of their actions. All of the problems in this show are the direct result of their reckless actions and they have to do what they can now to correct it.
The other show, on the more positive side, is Bob's Burgers. Bob Belcher to me is probably one of the actual best dads on TV and maybe in media period. He's not actively dumb like Homer Simpson or Peter Griffin, nor is he naïve in someway or another like Hank Hill or other bumbling tv dads.

"As much as I appreciate the sentiment behind this video, the idea that abusive parents must be depicted as incapable of loving their children is not always a helpful message to send either. It falls into the tendency of A) dehumanizing the very concept of ""an abuser"" to the extent that they must simply be monstrous villains, making it hard to for us to recognize that not all abuse in real life is presented as soulless cartoon villainy, and B) over-glorifying the idea of love as this necessarily benevolent force for good that will necessarily prevail against all evil.

But the fact is that things are not always so simple and painting it as so simple makes it hard to recognize and confront actual abuse when we're faced with it.  A parent can be loving to a child almost all of the time and still be abusive to them.  Making it out as if a parent could only ever abuse you if they don't love you will just make victims think ""Oh, well, my parents obviously do love me, so obviously they aren't abusers."" Which, again, is not a helpful mindset.  I would argue that a wiser message would be ""Love does not magically solve all problems. Even if my parents love me, that doesn't change the fact that they could still hurt me and that I need to be wary of that.""

It's a much uglier message.  It's much harder to hear, and to confront.  But it's still preferable to the simplistic fairy-tale depiction of abusive parents that, I'm sorry to say, appears to be what you are advocating for in its stead.",7,2,2018-06-16T07:00:18.000Z,BrianWilly,UCkSrC6e3e0Tsh10VzTlaeig,aJ0nAkXOkMs,True,Ugy6aSeTxOdIH6fGVJJ4AaABAg

"Great analysis! It really got me thinking about his work in a different way, especially his use of Harry Belafone's music in Beetlejuice. And it's not just his old movies - even his current movies are super white. I still consider myself a Tim Burton fan, although I've long ago lost my rose tinted glasses. Even so, the quotes from him in this video were disappointing to say the least. My fandom has always been about the aesthetics for me, I never thought his movies were especially deep. I just love the way his movies look and sound (side note: Danny Elfman may be the real reason I got into Tim Burton movies).

I grew up on the Beetlejuice cartoon and I remember watching the movie later, but while I was still quite young, and being confused and upset that Beetlejuice was so mean. I kept wondering how he was going to redeem himself and become friends with Lydia by the end of the movie and it never happened. I do love the movie now, but to me he is unquestionably a bad guy and I would not want to go on wacky adventures with him.

I had a bit of a different take away from how suburbia was shown in Edward Scissorhands. To me it was about how some people will accept the outsider as long as they're nice and accommodating and helpful. They might welcome them, but more as a curiosity than as an actual person. But if the outsider stops being nice, accommodating, and helpful or makes a mistake, suddenly those differences that were previously accepted or even liked become a problem to ostracize them for. Also, was I the only one that read that scene in the backroom of the salon as Joyce assaulting Edward? And then she tells everyone that he assaulted her. It always made me feel intensely uncomfortable. So I saw her as less of a sexually liberated housewife and more of a predator, but I guess that wasn't the intent behind the scene.",1,0,2018-06-16T00:08:17.000Z,nutstothis,UCtUsOCkMy-aSfvOhlLCgwKQ,inXrIYr2V_U,True,UgyP8q8ho9NcNDc_EDx4AaABAg

"Christ - screw you for doing this to me.

You're being reductionist when it comes to...kind of everything.  Films don't have to make one statement of grand truth, and usually don't.  Pa Kent isn't supposed to be universally correct in this situation.  He's not Uncle Ben.  He's trying to tell a child - universally and uniformly one of the stupider kinds of people - to consider the cost that helping others in big, showy ways will cost him.  He's worried about his kid.  This isn't really a surprising reaction for him.

Similarly, flipping your shit in response to a murder of somebody closely involved with you.  I have a somewhat complicated relationship with a lot of members of my family, but you can bet that if somebody decided for me to remove them from my life I would get pretty pissed.  For me.  That's not love of others - it is, if anything, love of self.  When Bucky took the elder Starks away, that would seem to an egomaniac like Tony as though one person had been the font for everything in his life about which he was unsatisfied.  It's not necessarily because he loves them so bad.

I don't know what to say about Thanos.  He's the villain.  You're generally supposed to think he's the bad guy.  It's right there in the name.  If you're regarding him as a paragon of virtue as the viewer, you're probably not quite connecting with the movie on the same wavelength as it happens to be broadcasting.

The whole religion thing at the end gets particularly painful.  We can't know whether it was the egg or the chicken that came first, but it's certainly understandable to view the force that you believe created the universe as a parental figure - a father.  When that entity is coded male, this should be utterly unsurprising, and doesn't necessarily represent some sort of imagined history where a proto-Kim Jong Il commanded other people to love him.  You're argument here is just flimsy and silly.

I don't even necessarily disagree with a lot of what you say, but if you're going to do this whole video essay thing, you've got to get better at it.

"Great points, this is a really good video, though the word ""Daddy"" just sounds like nonsense now.  I think your take on bats vs sups is right, but I think it also has that extra layer of ""You're the son of Martha, I'm the son of Martha!?!"" (Martha being Mary).  Come to think of it religion has really made its mark (thanks capt obv), but Jesus is the first Peter Parker & Tony Stark situation, we identify with Jesus bc he is human, becomes a new more understanding, but still demanding Daddy, sacrifices himself for our sake which also makes us identify with God bc of the terrible choice he had to make, kill one child for all of his children, but then the icing on the oedipal cake is that God and Jesus are the same person.  So we identify with Son, Daddy, Surrogate/Step Daddy, and the Son-Who-Becomes-His-Daddy while establishing 2 of the base philosophical requirements for fascist authoritarianism: sacrificing oneself & sacrificing others for the good of society, if a person believes both of those things then there is nothing they can't rationalize for Daddy's sake.",1,0,2018-06-14T13:26:32.000Z,Kevin Carroll,UCOg638E9rx3iT7xxJDccJZg,aJ0nAkXOkMs,True,UgxwOj1zjhCy12ZXLNp4AaABAg

"Tim Burton, to me, has always been the really weak version of Joe Dante. Like, I love Ed Wood, but I've seen Ed Wood done so much better as far as story goes - and that film is called Matinee.

Same taking-back-of-exploitation/schlock themes, but whereas Ed is celebrated entirely sarcastically - like ""oh, nobody's gonna like this weirdo"" - Woolsey is celebrated as a man who can at least give some minor comfort to people stressed out over the Cold War while also showing them how their own paranoia and bigotry effectively created Mant.

If you want films that actually deconstruct the things Burton fans claim he deconstructs, check out The 'Burbs (deconstructing neighborhood watches, ingrained bigotry in both suburbia and authority figures, vigilantism, and what makes a villain a villain), Gremlins (deconstructing cultural appropriation - although it has its problems, i.e. you can easily read the gremlins and mogwai as stand-ins for black people if you take the film as an analysis of white flight), Looney Tunes: Back in Action (deconstructing the intense corporatization of film by using ACME as the de facto villains; and how anybody can easily be retooled as a villain), and fucking Small Soldiers (deconstructing the military-industrial complex and how it has its greedy little hands on everything you own, only to pay you off/get your mind off of their destruction when their technology backfires).

Dante's films are visually very striking and have the resemblance of popcorn films, but my God, they say so much more on second and third viewings. Dude's a fucking genius.

Burton has the best visual style, but Dante has the best stories.",6,2,2018-06-13T21:46:30.000Z,Hal Emmerich,UC8bf78wL7YHyD4HdIHKVGpQ,inXrIYr2V_U,True,Ugym3EFi4bzqP6XDOzF4AaABAg

"If only this video was more about Daddy's Home.

That being said, I love Man of Steel, but Johnathan Kent is by far the weakest part of that movie. From the contradictions to the pointless death. Again, that being said, I do like a couple things about his portrayal. For one thing he's not an altruistic wisdom fountain like every other parent/guardian in comics. I also kind of like that ""I don't know, maybe"" response. 

It's pretty human. Parents generally care about the safety and happiness of their children above all. Let's say a kid dies protecting his fellow classmates from a shooter. Sure the parent might be proud of them but if they could change things they'd tell them not to go to school that day knowing that he wouldn't be there to save anyone.

In that scene Johnathan is worried about his son being discovered, taken away, locked up, and experimented on. He's also worried about what the discovery will mean for the world. So when he says ""I don't know, maybe"" to me it feels like an honest human reaction. Does that make it a good thing to tell a kid? No. Does that make it right? No. It just makes it kind of realistic.",6,7,2018-06-12T21:05:59.000Z,julianwelton,UCLvM5yXmO3qdMWAKGqnb0ug,aJ0nAkXOkMs,True,Ugy8wsNG8VM-_nkl1rx4AaABAg

"This is a pretty weird trend. Though I'd argue that the MCU at least understands that its bad dads are bad dads. When Tony loses it in Civil War, he specifically says it's because Bucky killed his mom, who we see in the flashback he was much closer to than his cold, possibly emotionally abusive dad. Then Gamorra straight up says to Thanos what you said: ""This isn't love."" And Lindsay Ellis has a great video on how GotG2 doesn't apologize for Yondu's abusiveness, but is instead about how a child's relationship with an abusive parent can be extremely complicated.

Though at the same time, Odin is presented as the good and wise daddy to the end when he was a really bad dad to all three of his kids.

"Great video, Maggie.  You make very excellent points.  I understand your perspective approaching this with fresh eyes but I stand by my tweet that Beetlejuice is a fun, quirky, romp.  I would agree, the racial and gender tropes did not age well, but you can say that about a lot of different content from that era. The sets, the dialog, the pacing, and the characters in Burton's films stand out from the normal Hollywood fair.  As a storyteller, he paints a landscape that reflects a lush imagination but also reveals his imperfections as a person.  Different visions are so rarely depicted on film that we want to peel back the veneer to find there's an allegory that reveals something deep and meaningful.  Does that always have to be the case?  In a film industry so overfull of safe, cookie-cutter, star driven, formulaic stories and sequels, it's a miracle a film like this from an unproven director even got made.  Blue Velvet is a very different film, very dense and difficult to watch so I don't feel that's a fair analogue other than to point out that like David Lynch, Wes Anderson and Christopher Nolan, Burton has a stylistic signature that defines his art.  Beetlejuice is not hilarious, not meaningful, but it is a darkly funny film about a creepy, asshole of an anti-hero who violates social norms and gives no F's.  The 10 year old version of this white boy from the suburbs thoroughly enjoyed it.",2,1,2018-05-28T20:20:41.000Z,Derrik Lamb,UCVc_Ve2J38TsE1gCgkND7Ww,inXrIYr2V_U,True,Ugz_ZGirUG0r076YD7B4AaABAg

"Hey, Maggie, love the vids! SO, a couple things about the Tyrion theory. In the books, it is strongly suggested that the Mad King had a thing for Joanna (Tyrion and the twin's mother) and that he may have assaulted her at one point. However, the Mad King's wife sent Joanna back to Casterly Rock after the incident and Tyrion was born three years later. Also, having blond, curly hair is a distinct characteristic of the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. ALSO, also, in the books Tyrion has one black eye and one green one. Green eyes being another strong genetic marker of a Lannister. Plus, from a writing perspective it would take a lot of emotional energy out of Tyrion's relationship with his father, and his family was a whole, if he wasn't really a Lannister. It's an idea that I wouldn't put past the TV writers, cause they kind of suck, but not George.

"I gotta admit, I am SUPER thrilled with the way the new Rogue One trailers are looking.  Like you, I felt somewhat less than blown away by TFA -- not that it wasn't good, per se, just that it felt rather derivative of what's come before in all the main plot points.  Orphaned Force-wielder, check, synth-voiced dark-armored villain, check, sand planet, ice planet, forest planet, check check check, climactic battle wherein X-Wings maneuver straight down a trench to blow up the totally-not-a-Death-Star-we-swear, double check.

So for me, Rogue One looks a lot like the franchise breaking fresh ground.  All to the good!

"Hello, how are you? Thank you for taking time out of your day to post your videos and giving us your honest opinions. After watching this trailer for the umpteenth time, it's almost like people have forgotten about Batman v Superman and I think that is all to do with the appearance of Spider-Man. The fact that our friendly neighborhood wall-crawler is on screen with the Avengers is a victory for both Marvel Studios and the fans worldwide. I like what I see so far but it's been a small glimpse, so I'll wait to see him in action once the film comes out. As far as the Spider-Man franchise as a whole, there are some aspects of the Tobey Maguire films that I liked, but some of it doesn't hold up too well in retrospect. Personally, I think Andrew Garfield was a better Spider-Man, but clearly Sony didn't learn its lesson from the mistakes made in 'Spider-Man 3'.",1,0,2016-03-18T00:19:09.000Z,michaelpkp,UCN6eSQkuR5Aqppr73O0epvw,SfP7sp0Zppw,True,Ughs80epcRYaVngCoAEC

Nice to see a adult movie for once as well instead of a ""free for all"", even though I saw some kids...Weird.

"OK, I'm curious.  Given that we've not yet seen any of Jon Bernthal in this (save the back of his head in that one walking-away shot :) ) what's your anticipation of his performance by way of comparison to earlier actors in the role?  (You know, looking at Ray Stevenson, Thomas Jane, waaaaay back to Dolph Lundgren...)

I admit I'm intrigued by the casting choice, given how nuanced, yet still very much on-the-edge, his performance was as Shane in The Walking Dead.  Given the depth of character development we saw with Wilson Fisk in the first season -- despite the somewhat more shallow caricatures of more than a few non-white characters there (Turk Barrett, Nobu, Madame Gao) -- it could be very interesting to watch.  Do you see him as antagonist, anti-villain, anti-hero... maybe even something else entirely, like a deuteragonist or a tritagonist?

And not to be forgotten in all this looking forward is Elodie Yung in the role of Elektra.  I'm honestly much more drawn to the possibilities inherent in her role than I am Frank Castle's (regardless of how much I like Bernthal as an actor).  Not only because it may be presumed that she and Matt already have history (or at least, so the offhanded comment about ""that Greek girl"" by Foggy in the college flashbacks during ""Nelson vs Murdock"" would suggest), but because there's the potential of a much more personal and emotional conflict.  Additionally, given what may or may not be drawn over from comics canon, Elektra had a substantial involvement with not only Stick (and the Chaste) but also with the Hand (which it was strongly implied Nobu was affiliated with).

So.  Your thoughts?",0,0,2016-01-03T22:02:50.000Z,M DeVries,UCGt6UGN5B-2wJTbd1YdKiHA,x_uKpg5qwcw,True,UghBPWzmtpOmBXgCoAEC

"Happy to see you back!

I can already tell there is going to be a few differences from the movie and I think the changes will add some really good depth. I'm really hoping Captain Ginyu comes back... We saw the frog and I'm hoping like he snuck aboard the ship and gets a new body. 

Other things... I love Freeza's Hell. I always get a good laugh from the cuddly animals wanting a hug. Piccalo is pretty much a baby sitter now.

When did the Dragon become available for 3 wishes? The dragon said oh when you revive a bunch of people it uses 2 wishes but, in DBZ the dragon clearly states he can only grant two. I think that was a mistake they made or forgot about. Whatever that's the nerd speaking in me.

"This episode was alright. Some moments, but nothing that really mattered to me. I'm happy that time has passed and Goku hasn't known about Vegeta's training for 6 months. He hasn't stuck his nose into Vegeta's business and I think Whis is bringing Goku because he believes

1) Vegeta is just as strong.
2) Vegeta has hit a wall and needs Goku to help him break that.

Personally I think Vegeta has now just as strong as Goku now.

I also loved seeing into the lives of Gohan and Bulma. Looking forward to next week, I can't wait to see some of the training Vegeta has gone though.

Most computers these days are easy to fix.  Unless it is a hard drive failure or a laptop power issue (ie. failed mainboard or power supply) then you should expect your computer back in your possession in a few days.  It may even be a good opportunity to perhaps have the computer store you brought it to do some upgrades at the same time to make it better.

"Not much to say about this episode, but I really had fun with this one. I loved the Mr. Satan's made up story where he goes Super Saiyan and fights a Beerus with horns and wings. The only thing I wish he would of added was Vegeta once again saying ""I wish I were him.""  Also Chi Chi shouldn't be allowed near the family money. The family lasted longer on Goku's tournament winnings from Dragonball and it was way less. 

Anyways, looking forward greatly to next week! We get Whis back and just seeing Vegeta ask for help. It's defiantly not his usual thing... I'm expecting good character development here. This is what ties BoG to Resurrection F.


As for the question: I think Vegeta can become stronger then Goku. Until the training in the hyperbolic time chamber, I thought Vegeta kept on par. Then with the introduction of DB Super and the Battle of Gods movie, Vegeta was said to have surpassed Goku's Super Saiyan 3 level just as a base form Super Saiyan. Then you look at the Resurrection F movie where Whis believes that what holds Vegeta back is the fact he places too much of a chip on his shoulder. He has the potential, but I highly doubt Toriyama will let Vegeta become stronger then Goku. Expect him to be an equal at the least.

"Battle of Gods is Over! Thank God! I will say I loved the fight between Gods. We got to see abilities that Beerus didn't show in the movie and I really do believe that there power levels were much closer then the movie. Still give the advantage to Beerus though. I wouldn't call the ending a comp out either... seems to me like he put on a show and pretended like he fell asleep.

All together I enjoy the movie way more. Less filler, Pilaf's group actually had a reason to be there and Beerus was a lot more fun. Plus Beerus made Goku say ""I give up."" This was a way that made Goku realize that he has more to grow. Also Vegeta in the end of the movie wanted a chance with the Saiyan God powers next, while Super counter claimed that.

I think we'll have 4-5 episodes before Resurrection F starts so I look forward to these filler episodes. I'm most looking forward to seeing how Vegeta becomes a Saiyan God.",2,0,2015-10-12T06:41:43.000Z,achsdu17,UChVhIDM6jNnwSdWZFotlpjQ,o1g6U16KBQw,True,UghINSZqf84yFXgCoAEC

"You know... we never saw Beerus at 100% power. He mentions that he had to use it in order to negate the attack that could of wiped out the Universe. Clearly telling Goku he still hasn't fought him at full strength. It's a little after they continue that Goku goes out of the Saiyan God form. While still retaining the Saiyan God strength, I think it's fatigue that is starting to set in on Goku. I think the outcome will be the same as the movie and Goku is going to take this as a form he needs to train up.

I was kind of annoyed with Hercule / Mr. Satan's time on screen, but I did love the moment he wrote on a napkin All You Can Eat for Free! If Whis would of accepted, talk about being the savior of Earth.

"I have to really agree with you... this redone battle between Gods has been a lot of fun, but episode 12 has really taken the fight to the next level. In the movie I never felt once that Goku was on the same level as Beerus. However, in Super it's clear Beerus has shown frustration at time and has had to take Goku more seriously then he had in the movie. Now how much power Beerus is actually using is still not clear, Goku is getting stronger, but I feel that while Goku will still come up short the power gap it will not be as big as shown in the movie. Who knows Goku may even transform into a Super Saiyan God *Blue Hair*, in this battle to show he's fully transformed. 

I also hope the side story stuff stays to a minimum. Keep Pilaf away, show more of the destruction around the galaxy and maybe show characters that might be taking notice of the battle.",1,0,2015-09-27T23:34:36.000Z,achsdu17,UChVhIDM6jNnwSdWZFotlpjQ,qdBUtSK8Hhs,True,UggxQvYIwUc4mXgCoAEC

"""I hope the series is kind of darker"", so it is a very good chance that it will be considering the most impactful story for Jessica Jones is incredibly dark. I don't think they will go as dark as the comic did because it is VERY dark. Purple Man is a very twisted character and they could make this show very very dark if they want to.

""there is a divide between the films and these Netflix series"", they have already shown that they do exist in the same universe and are connected fundamentally but they are keeping them separate for a very specific reason. The films are characters that are incredibly powerful or incredibly skilled who deal with problems on an astronomical scale where as the Netflix characters are ""street level"" characters who deal with the more down and dirty villain types. It actually wouldn't make any sense to connect them at least until Iron Fist comes out because Luke Cage and Iron Fist are the only two of the Netflix characters that have powers that can compete at that level.",2,0,2015-09-22T02:49:36.000Z,Michael Tunnell,UCjK5jBSpcuJxp9ulhNOzPnA,emyjtTTbdXg,True,UggJPJMSe9yZGHgCoAEC

I do get very fed up when people moan about why are they remaking their classics e.c.t like grumpy schoolchildren? I'm sorry to use it as an example but to me it is simply the equivalent of when they made Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles into a live action movie back in 1990. It was totally thrilling to see when I was a kid. The animated world made flesh and blood (animatronic but real looking Turtles!). The magic of seeing an animated favorite made real as a very special complimentary piece to the original animated film! This is merely what Disney want to do. It's a great technical experiment and innovation in film-making how they do it also.,0,1,2015-09-19T16:39:41.000Z,Sean Kyle,UCFxNV84X3lOF-O8Bc0yP4jA,n_-Y6Fsoa8k,True,UggcUJLx5Zn323gCoAEC

"Have to say this was a pretty flat episode. Didn't really take much out of this... it was the old fashion warm up episode. Kind of boring. What annoyed me the most was bringing Pilaf's group back into it. They had a chance to be apart of the story and they didn't contribute anything like the movie. The one thing that I can take from this episode, was that I got the feeling that maybe Akira Toriyama might be reconsidering retconning the title Super Saiyan God. Before the battle began, there is confusion if the transformation worked or not. Whis confirms that the transformation was successful with the lack of Ki being felt. However, as Goku and Beerus started flying away, Gohan looks at the form and states that he still doesn't feel the transformation was the complete Super Saiyan God form. That caught my attention anyways and maybe wishful thinking on my part, since I call this form Saiyan God and leave the blue hair form as Super Saiyan God.",1,1,2015-09-14T00:59:35.000Z,achsdu17,UChVhIDM6jNnwSdWZFotlpjQ,FLO6QRmXeXA,True,UggEYIkdMxrd_ngCoAEC

"I'm really looking forward to Jessica Jones. Like yourself I absolutely loved Daredevil for the story, action, characters... it was as good as a superhero show can be. Now I only started learning about Jessica Jones' story recently... I learned about how her story came from an Adult Marvel line of books, her ""relationship"" with the Man in Purple... and if it's anything like the comics it's going to be a very dark, sexual, abusive, gritty story and it will be very interesting how they tell this story. Fortunately it's on Netflix so they can get away with a lot more. I love the casting... but I'm most excited that David Tennant is the bad guy in this series. If they take care of his character as good as Daredevil took care of Kingpin... OMG we are in for a treat. Not only Doctor Who, but I've been following him in many other performances. He's one of my favorites. Also in the trailer I can hear Tennant's voice mixed with the song... so while this trailer is very psychedelic, the adding of purple and his voice will give you a feel for the Man in Purple's powers.",1,0,2015-09-11T04:00:06.000Z,achsdu17,UChVhIDM6jNnwSdWZFotlpjQ,emyjtTTbdXg,True,UgjFVCH-osqw13gCoAEC
"Alias the comic Jessica Jones is based off launched Marvel's R-rated line of comics and its both very dark and very noir. The opening pages are about as noir detective as you can get, complete with the smoking habit you imagined her having.

"I wish I could of been that excited about this episode. Where last week brought us more of a spotlight on Vegeta and Oolong, this one just dragged on and on for way too long. I didn't care for the effects of the transformation, with golden clouds and water.... it just dragged on and didn't care for this episode much. I will say there were three things that did catch my attention. 1) Videl kind of going Super Saiyan thanks to Pan. That's the closest we've seen a female go SSJ. That's something we've wanted to see for decades and while it's not a full blown transformation, I did appreciate that. 2) The fact Bulma called out Vegeta not knowing what a Super Saiyan God was. You hear about the legend of the Super Saiyan over and over in the Freeza saga, but I'm surprised they didn't recon that story to work for the Super Saiyan God form. 3) Lord Beerus and the conversation he had about the Dragonballs and I agree with you on what it could mean for the future of the series. That's something to be excited about. 

Now considering the changes they made to this story... I have to wonder how Saiyan God Goku fairs with Beerus. Will Beerus have to use more power or less to defeat Goku?",0,1,2015-09-06T23:20:00.000Z,achsdu17,UChVhIDM6jNnwSdWZFotlpjQ,OIZDQ9OAmfw,True,UgiehnPwBsFtxXgCoAEC

Pilaf's group is so disappointing in the Super story. I liked how in the movie Mai acted as Trunk's girlfriend, they were involved in the story and here... they don't do anything.

I love these 3 guys and it's great to see JGL and Rogen in a film together again because 50/50 was amazing (this film is directed by the director of that movie as well) and if you haven't seen that... please check it out... it's such a great dramedy. But, anyways, great reaction and you got yourself a new subscriber. I'm looking forward to seeing what else you put up on your channel.

You used a fan-art drawing in your intro! All of those characters in that drawing are all fake, except for Lord Beerus.
