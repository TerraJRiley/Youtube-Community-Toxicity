"(sigh) THIS quest. This was the only quest (so far) that I actually just threw my hands up in frustration and looked up. I seriously spent a week of playing wandering around those freaking frozen wastes looking for that STUPID eighth heroine! It didn't help that I hadn't seen the other seven, so I didn't know what I was looking for! And then I found that giant sword, and I was all, ""Well, judging from how this game works, if the sword is here, then the rest of whatever held the sword is nearby. Maybe the statue fell over, or maybe it's upside down or something..."" And then when I finally looked it up and realized YOU CAN SEE THE STATUE ON THE WORLD MAP. SO IRRITATED. And to make matters worse, the quest text says you can find out more in town, but the only person I found who even seemed remotely interested was the historian who directs you somewhere else!

The backstory says they pretty much stopped the whole ""every so often link has to defeat ganon"" cycle and built robots to KEEP that peace, so that kind of explains why instead of a landscape dotted with dodongos and peahats, there are just goats and storks everywhere. also they did put in a wide variety of wildlife, so the total number of animal species is about where it should be
and then I realize skyward sword is the same, the world is pretty new (though the lanayru area has already gone through at least one ruined lost civilization) so there's a lot more normal animals running around. tons of normal insects, rather than a lot of hiploops and leevers. demise hadn't even become ganon yet, and certainly hadn't flooded the world with too many monsters. mostly just the blins, and then mostly just recently as the seal weakened.",2,0,2017-04-10T01:33:20.000Z

what they DO do, is fire a beam at ganon during the first phase of the final battle. the more you freed, the more damaged ganon will be. once all 4 guardians are free, ganon is knocked down to half of his health, making the first phase much easier.

also. for any divine beast you DIDNT free, you would have had to fight the corrosponding blight ganon boss in a gauntlet before you even FIGHT calamity ganon. if you went straight to ganon from the great plateu, you would have had to fight all 4 guardian blights in a row before you could even fight ganon. with no breaks. freeing the divine beasts should take priority above all else. not only does it make the final battle easier. but you get some pretty nifty powers.",1,0,2017-04-10T00:51:17.000Z

That what I did. I was looking all over for the 8th statue and only found the sword. So I took a picture assuming the rest of the statue got destroyed to buried in snow or something. But when I went back to him he it didn't work. So I looked up online where the statue was. Went there. Got the picture. Showed it to him. Talked to him again. He asked for the sword. Showed him the picture I already took of the sword and it worked. Got both boots! Then we fuuuucked! No, not really. The game didn't give me the option.

I knew he'd spoil the dragons for Dan, and despite Dan saying not to spoil the master sword stuff, he still continues to talk about it getting pretty damn close to spoiling it anyway.

Also, how does he not know he CAN keep both the snow and sand boots. Literally just talk to the dude again. Take a pic of the sword. Then boom. Both boots are yours.

The side quests are just kind of bland in Zelda, it's mostly just ""Go fetch this for me"" but in Skyrim it's like ""GO FIND A FUCKING PRIEST DUDE SO YOU CAN BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HIM IN A CAGE WITH A RUSTY CLUB FOR A DEMON"" and yes, there are some side quests in Zelda that aren't just fetch, like that one where you build up a little town with Hudson, that shit was super fun, but idk I just feel like Skyrim had a lot more to do and never really got old for me.",0,2,2017-04-09T21:47:56.000Z
