"Ugh.... I thought this was an old video because of the date's Sept 19th... But nope, it's September already. Warning to the young ones reading this. As you get older, time starts going by much much faster. But at the same time, if life is a struggle when you get older, at least the days go by faster. But Birthdays become a blink of an eye. However I ended up doing the same thing I last decade and thought I was already 37, but apparently, I just turned 37 so it feels more like I got a year younger. (I thought I was 27 when I was 26 too. I guess I just don't like the number six? 81's my favorite and lucky number but I rarely get to use it for anything. Oooh, I'm gonna get balls to the wall trashed on my 81st birthday!!!! haha, kidding. I won't be around by then.) Not if my lifespan's anything like my family's. I'm well over the hill in that respect.

Great channel by the way. Earned a new subscriber! Sadly, I have some friends from where I used to live last month who I could never get to watch any. Well... Or admit. I might have a couple friends who may secretly watch. And if I widen the area to include all of my friends, I have quite a few who would love this channel's content. I'm whatever you call someone who prefers the opposite gender these days, but also am comfortable enough with my own sexuality to admit this person's kind of hot. But so was my ex-wife and it didn't take long for those looks to seem more monster-like than attractive. :P It's all about personality. But after my last break up I decided to just be alone until I can learn to love myself more. I don't think I'll ever learn though. :D Ugh... where'd I put that cyanide...

(No, grammarly. I WILL NOT CHANGE MY FOUR DOT ELIPSES INTO A THREE DOT ELIPSES! I WILLINGLY CHOSE 4!!!!).... sorry.  I sometimes like to imagine Grammarly is a person.

"There's the duality of trans identity, both from the point of a personal experience versus the social expectations of what it means to BE a gender.
This video really glosses over some finer points as a means of making a more concise point of view, one which I think that other trans folx also experience (I know I do).

Whats not considered is the validity of genders past binary divisions of male and female. Such a distinction is probably skipped over as its a whole other kettle of fish, one which Natalie may not feel comfortable discussing as it is beyond her own experiences as enby gender identity is extremely diverse.",0,0,2018-09-23T01:41:44.000Z

"I really related to the debate presented in this video, especially the part about gender being a performative effort. I came out as gay several years ago, and I thought that would once and for all  ""correct"" my inner homophobia, or at least redirect me to a more productive headspace, but it did not. Oftentimes I still feel like my old self years and years ago, so terrified of being ""found out"" that I would consciously think of my movements, my gait, my voice; micromanaging every single perceivable trait so as to not get ""clocked."" I still struggle with that today, to the point where every interaction in the public space, especially with strangers, feels like I'm holding a cup filled to the brim with water that I must never spill while unicycling on a tightrope at the top of the Burj Khalifa. It has left me utterly devastated because even if I am technically out, I still engage in the performance of it all, and no single costume (for lack of a better word) feels right for me. It feels as if my internalized homophobia has left me permanently scarred, and that I must conform to what society perceives as acceptable in order for me to belong. But then, that violates my principles, and I feel as if that disposition invalidates why I came out in the first place. I don't have answers yet, and I doubt I will get them anytime soon.

"Justine was adopting a True Scum conformist defeatist stance.  Following her path can probably help a white trans woman who already has access to resources avoid some negatives associated with being trans, but it does nothing for virtually all other flavours of trans.  Coming off as passable or non-threatening doesn't stop those in power from being assholes against all the other trans people out there.

Tabby's path of radical self acceptance and revolt//resistance can lead to lasting positive change for other trans people, and eventually for the cis themselves.  We must stand up to power, build community in solidarity with eachother, and push for change instead of trying to fit in to an already flawed and sexist institution of femininity.",0,0,2018-09-22T19:30:11.000Z

"I think the solution might be something Natalie said as Justine in one of the earlier videos: being cool. Cool meaning appearing confident and in control of your emotions. By staying cool (while remaining approachable) you can make anything cool. Is it a kind of performance? Yes, but one that is used to express and make acceptable something unique and outside of prescribed norms - a synthesis of Tabby's drive for authenticity and Justine's knack for persuasion. 

A great example is the character of Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones. Who would've thought a man with dwarfism could become a global icon of cool and sex appeal? Peter Dinklage made being a little person 'cool' through playing a character imbued with a deep, authentic charisma that embraces authenticity, collectedness, humor and vulnerability.

In the words of The Imp himself: ""Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armour and it can never be used to hurt you."" I think we transfolk (as well as other marginalised groups) can learn from that.",1,0,2018-09-22T18:57:02.000Z

this is a great video that brings up a lot of points that transwomen face beyond cis women. transwomen have to work so incredibly hard to get to the sort of ""base level"" of women hood that most feminists are trying to break out of.  as a genderqueer cis woman, i've always struggled with not feeling like i can or should be feminine, that is was something for thinner, prettier girls than me. that putting on make up or wearing my hair in such a way was entirely unacceptable and while i have in the past few years grown used to it as a form of art i perform for myself, i still can't move into a lot of traditional feminine roles. i still look at a bra or dress and thing 'that isn't for me'. the transwoman experience is so vastly different from my own and i support and love every transgirl out there. skinny, fat, pretty, masculine, pre-transition, post-transition.  i love you all! please do you however you feel you need to. <3",0,0,2018-09-22T17:37:03.000Z

"If Justine is correct, why transition at all? You can do more good to trans people the more acceptable you are to cis society, therefore the most acceptable thing to be would be a cis man. A cis male ally could speak definitively in favor of trans rights, and wouldn't ever have to worry about being an example of how bad trans women are.

To be clear, this is a reducto ad absurdum, I'm saying it to point out what I believe is a central flaw in Justine's position. Be the man, woman, or enby you are most comfortable being.

"Coming from the medical point of view, patients must always indicate their genetic sex (male: XY; female: XX) and if they are transgendered and if they take any medications such as hormone therapy and if they have had any previous surgical procedures (sex change). Really nothing to do with how you are percieved, but with how you are going to be medically treated. You are still different from a ""cis-woman"" biologically and so you will be treated differently medically (for your benefit and so as to not confuse the doctor and medical staff). So I believe it must be required to state your genetic sex in medical papers. However, what sex you choose on your email account creation is your business...

In medical school, posession of the Y chromosome means you're a male. Lack of Y chromosome means female. This also applies to those with genetic mutations with sex chromosomes. For example: Klinefelter syndrome, gene 47, XXY is considered a male. This is because of the presence of the SRY gene (among other things) on the Y chromosome.",1,0,2018-09-22T00:20:15.000Z

"This was an incredibly disappointing video. The entire video, Justine is on the offensive, and Tabby is merely reactionary, offering up brief rebuttals to what Justine says. The entire conversation is weighted heavily towards Justine's point of view. Then at the end,  they both just kinda resign themselves. Regardless of what your intentions or true beliefs are, this frames it in a way that implies Justine is right. Except she's not. Tabby is clearly right in this situation. It's not a matter of nuance or grey areas - Tabby is just 100% correct and Justine is wrong. And the voice of reason has been reduced to a wacky, cardboard cutout.

Justine's argument - the argument of this video - is that performance matters more than personal identity. This is just false. This toxic idea is shared by many on the far right and even the trolls of TTTT you referenced in your recent Incels video. By giving their argument the favored argument in this skit, you're validating it.  Like, what are you even trying to say by showing the clip of Caitlyn Jenner threatening Ben Shapiro? How about you focus on the insidious transphobia of Shapiro and not ""lol look at this crazy trans woman.""

You must realize that as a trans content creator, a large part of your fanbase is also trans. And you know what? By making this video, you weren't just telling Tabby that she isn't valid for not performing womanhood right; you were telling a lot of them that too.  I'm not sure why you would decide to make a gatekeepy, TERFy video about how trans women who don't dress or look the way society deems normal are ""faking it til they make it"" (those are YOUR words in the video) because they already get bombarded by that message on a daily basis. 

And finally, according to Justine - who, again, is framed as being the correct one - you are either performing womanhood or you are a man. There is a complete erasure in this argument of NB and genderfluid people.

I'm still a fan  of yours, obviously. And I don't even think necessarily that you agree with Justine; I think you just accidentally wrote this debate in a way that constantly keeps her on the offensive, gives her a far greater amount of time speaking, and make it seem like we're supposed to come away from this either agreeing with Justine or thinking 'Wow both sides have a pont.' But I just hope that next time you put a bit more thought into your words and the effect they have.",2,3,2018-09-21T22:50:56.000Z

The first people to fly weren't the Wright Brothers. A German immigrant named Gustave Whitehead beat them to manned flight. But the Wright Brothers had what he didn't - publicity and exposure.

"While I appreciate the artistic style and the humor, and I recognize that the scope of this debate is within feminist conceptions of gender (gender as an internally experienced identity vs gender as an externally performed social role), I do not like the presentation of these two schools of thought as if they were the only viable views on gender. In fact, I'd argue that neither one is satisfactory in its own right:

If transgender feminism is correct and gender is an internally experienced identity, then what exactly does it ""feel"" like to be a man/woman? Why is it that cis men and women are genuinely puzzled when it's suggested that it ""feels"" a certain way to be a man/woman? And why is it that the only examples people seem to be able to point to of what it ""feels like"" to be a man/woman are sexual experiences (i.e. what it's like to have sex as a man or as a woman), which are in fact attributable entirely to biological sex and not some subjectively experienced identity?

If queer feminism is correct and gender is an externally performed social role, then it's not at all clear that gender categories like ""man""/""woman"" , ""boy""/""girl"", ""him""/""her"", etc. actually refer to what people mean by these terms. Ludwig Wittgenstein was correct in defining meaning as use - whatever we use a certain word to mean, that's what that word means. If we use ""man"" to mean ""male adult human"" (which is what most people do mean by the word, and the way it's typically understood), and queer feminism says that ""man"" actually means ""person who performs the gender role typically associated with males"", then queer feminism is mistaken (until such a time as we actually DO use gender designations that way). By the way, Wittgenstein was also correct in saying that you can't have your own private language - that's exactly what we're seeing with people who use this definition of gender, as they quickly get everybody confused and everybody starts talking past one another because they're playing incompatible language-games.

Neither of these theories of gender is satisfactory. In fact, the reason why they're not satisfactory is probably because they run parallel to the nature vs nurture debate (gender as an internal identity = gender is all nature; gender as an externally performed social role = gender is all nurture). Well, guess what? It's always both nature and nurture, and gender will undoubtedly prove no different. 

I know Contra has done a video on gender in the past where she narrowed down all the viable theories of gender to feminist theories, but that doesn't mean those arguments are settled, and it doesn't entitle you to ignore all non-feminist perspectives on gender. Just because you stipulate that ""gender"" is distinct from ""biological sex"" does not mean that the words we typically think of as constituting gender actually ARE distinct from biological sex. Just because you establish a stipulative definition of ""gender"" that you use in an academic context does not mean you get to impose that definition and pretend it's actually the lexical definition. These are all invalid moves, and it's not the way to have a discussion. (But if it's all politics anyway and politics is just aesthetics, then I guess it's valid. Well, it's not as if policies have actual real-world consequences and should be rationally determined in such a way that makes people in society better off, right?)",3,4,2018-09-21T19:07:10.000Z

"About the helicopter example though... Can't we say that cats (or pets) are kind of social roles, and that in a sense, Tabby is performing this role in some ways? She hisses, people can look at her and see that she looks like a ""catgirl"", she wants to be scratched? She performs ""felininity"" just as much as ""femininity"". People perform animalistic social roles in furry fandom, kink, etc: the human expectation of what it means to be an animal, just like dragqueen shows are the male expectation of what it means to be a woman. People act differently towards pets than towards humans or wild animals. And humans, generally, tend to find it degrading to be ""treated like animals"".

Let's say that just like biological sex and gender may be defined differently, where gender is the social equivalent... could there perhaps be a social equivalent to the (biological) species?

"Amazing video, as always. That thing about ""being robbed of your gender"" was spot on. 
I think the best way to understand that is seeing trans people early in their transitions as teenagers during puberty (it's kind of what it is, a second puberty). Like, try misgendering an insecure young girl or boy, then see if they don't feel like shit and hate you forever. 
For example, I am an heterosexual cis man, and I'm now pretty ok with my masculinity (I am 22, I have a massive beard, an high forehead, and get often mistaken for an older man in a somewhat neutral to positive way, so...), but I remember, when I was in middle school once I got misgendered by an old woman in front of my classroom just because I had long hair, no beard, and I'm very short. I assure you I wasn't at all feminine, and it was kind of a ridiculous situation, but it still felt like shit. When I said to her I was male, she was embarrassed and told me to cut my hair, my class laughed, and I hated her. I got over it in a few weeks. 
If a person keeps getting misgendered into adulthood (thing that is very unusual for cis people, so it seems weird to them), they can either continue feeling like shit, become angry and bitter (see incel/trans parallel in Contrapoints' earlier video), or toughen up and don't give a fuck anymore, but it's still a shitty thing to do. 
Cis people think it's not a big deal, but try being misgendered over and over, and over, and over again during a dinner or public meeting of sort, then tell me if it isn't irritating as fuck. 
It makes you snap at a certain point. Also, if you're confident with your gender (like most adult cis people are), it's only irritating, but if you're not (like most trans people), it's soul-crushing. 
In fact, it wouldn't be a problem to be ""less of a man"", or ""less of a woman"", if that didn't implicitly mean ""less of a person"", and ""lesser"" in absolute terms. So if you are in a situation where you just can't take it, it's not ""robbing you of your gender"", but ""robbing you of your humanity"". 
And I do not intend this in a ""monstrous unspeakable thing"" sense, like torture and the like: every one of us experiences little moments of humiliation and dehumanization sometimes, without even realizing that. It's not uncommon, but it's still shit, and if you know with relative confidence that something is likely to have that effect, you could stop, just for common courtesy.
Anyways... that was my rant to ""normies"" (I kind of hate that word). Thanks for the patience. Feel free to quote me in any discussion you will happen to have with oblivious cis people on the matter, if you feel you're out of arguments to explain yourself :)

People who think appearances matter more than truth are, in my opinion, wrong.

"If the argument is that women have been aesthetically conditioned by men to be appealing over the years, who is the radical feminist aesthetic appealing to? Or is the idea that women being appealing is a form of bondage? I'm reminded of that African tribe again, the one who put plates in their lips to make themselves unappealing to slavers - over time, the act lost its meaning as a warding-off thing and instead became something attractive. Suggesting that it doesn't matter how fucked-up a society makes its people look, they will eventually find that shit attractive.
The beauty ideal a couple of centuries ago was plump women and most Rennaisance art depicts BBWs as icons of perfection - these days, that's a niche fetish and being slim is important.
In Japan, women would blacken their teeth with soot and having black teeth was gorgeous.
I think Radical Feminism has a very relative view of female beauty - stereotypical almost - and it doesn't account for differences in culture and the evolutions of the beauty aesthetic in general - and judging by the African tribe scenario, it doesn't really matter how much women try to make themselves unappealing to men: nature doesn't give a shit about their ideas.",1,0,2018-09-21T08:30:35.000Z

"I think... I'm really going to have to disagree with you on this one, which doesn't happen that often. I don't think you can equate a job with gender identity, I think however you identify and in whichever ways you express femininity is an entirely psychological and personal experience, while a job you perform is extremely impersonal and I would say it's something the average person rarely if ever actually cares about on a personal level. Losing your job isn't terrifying because you can't do that job anymore, it's terrifying because you need a way to support yourself. One individual job isn't important. Being misgendered isn't terrifying because I won't be able to buy food otherwise, it's terrifying because I'm having that gender taken away from me, and that _is_ intrinsically personally important. 

Additionally, I would argue that gender is _not_ purely a practical and social identity, it's just as much of a personal one. I don't understand how you can previously state that you ""can't sleep without a bra on, because you must feel something on your chest"", and then state that your gender is only relevant when it comes to how people treat you. Sleeping with a bra on doesn't strike me at all as part of your unquenchable and slightly terrifying thirst for validation, but I also believe that it's more than just a ""daydream"" you're having (stating that the experiences and struggles of pre-transition transwomen are ""daydreams"" is disgusting, by the way. Do you also really not understand that transwomen don't like to be equated to drag queens? Under like, any circumstances?). That's part of a genuine and personal experience that you are experiencing alone, regardless of social judgement. 

I really agree with Tabby when she says ""All your advice is just to turn me into you"", because that's what it is. Natalie says ""My way is the right way, why aren't you all doing it my way?"" Then you actually go out of your way to cause harm to people like Tabby who express it in their own way, which I personally recognise as perfectly valid aswell. I don't care if some transwomen wear cat ears and want to smash things, that's who they are. I feel content allowing them to live their lives without hunting them down and telling them they're not real women unless they wear dresses. It strikes me as, frankly, an extremely self-important and masculine worldview.

I feel that Natalie's worldview comes from a place of autocratic practicality, and of panic. She seems to have this desire to strategize the world's population of transwomen into a singular identity to forward some vague goal, but I would argue that there is always room for interpretation, thought, and discussion, in any community. I think transwomen with broad shoulders, bald heads, cat ears, and those who wear combat boots, should be welcomed as women just as much as the passing bourgeois. I also think they have just as much of a right to call themselves women. I think you're going to have to accept that some people just express their femininity differently to you, and I just don't understand how the trans community functions when the dominant mindset is that there is only a single brand of womanhood and that we all must follow, or get out. Am I so incredibly ostracised seriously just because I love people for who they are rather than telling them they're _being themselves incorrectly_ and telling them who they should be?

Furthermore, concerning strategization of the population, I just don't understand what the goal could possibly be. You won't ""win"" politics, if that's what you want, the struggle between progressivism and conservatism will always exist. What could you possibly hope to gain by eliminating different interpretations of femininity and uniting transwomen under your singular ideal of womanhood? I don't really want to become an autocratic soldier, dedicated to the unflinching will of Natalie Wynn, so I guess I'm not welcome here. It scares me that this mindset is the dominant mindset in transwomen, because I don't feel safe around them. I don't really want to be hunted down and attacked because I don't resemble a 1950s housewife. That's just not my idea of femininity, but I guess according to Natalie that makes me the anti-christ. Yeah, I know she'd sarcastically say ""That must be so hard for you"" or some such, and I know I'm not a starving African child or a disabled woman of colour living in the American ghettos, but that doesn't make my suffering literally completely irrelevant. It just strikes me as Natalie cherry picking the struggles that support her worldview while downplaying the struggles of those who disagree with her by resorting to insulting her opponent's privilege... much like TERFs love to do.

Lastly, it depresses me to even bring it up, but did you really reference _Nietzsche_ of all people? You have to ""become yourself""? I thought we were beyond this edgy teenager's infuriating idea of ""philosophy"", but apparently we're still rolling around in the pile of cum Nietzsche left from masturbating to himself and declaring himself the single greatest human being who will ever exist. The guy who caught the flu one time and declared that none will ever experience suffering the way he did. The rich white German guy who couldn't get laid, and so wrote an entire thesis about how it's because he's _too_ amazing. The guy who equated himself with a holy prophet, and said the only reason people ever refute his ideas is because they're too scared to admit he's right. In fact, that strikes me as familiar; Natalie, people like Tabby aren't refusing your idea of femininity because they're ""scared of the truth"" or whatever edgy, childish idea you think, they're refusing because it's not _their_ idea of femininity. It's almost as if people are individuals with their own experiences, thoughts, and feelings. Similarly, there is no amorphous entity known as ""men"" who judge your womanhood, ""men"" are also individuals who have different ideas of femininity, too. One man might deem you extremely feminine, while another might deem you as seeming fake, and liken you to a drag queen. Even what _you_ see as feminine doesn't appear to me as particularly feminine, for example. It's more psychological to me, rather than physical. ~It's what's on the inside, my dudette.~ 

I'm not even saying that your interpretation of femininity is incorrect and that you should conform to mine, which is what you seem to be saying, I'm just saying there are different interpretations out there, and that even those who judge your femininity have different interpretations, so it's literally impossible to force the entire population of transwomen to conform to society's idea of ""femininity"", because I don't really think there is one. If you look at Hollywood recently, apparently ""femininity"" is the act of wearing combat boots and killing people, and... I still see that as a valid expression of femininity. If that's the kind of woman you want to be, I don't really see why you shouldn't be allowed to pursue that. You'd probably be much more interesting to talk to than whatever embodiment of traditional ""womanhood"" Natalie wants you to be.

It just hurts that I'm hated by the society I live in because I don't conform to my given gender, so I turn to the trans community, who then hate me because I don't conform enough to their ideal of what my preferred gender is. Now I'm in the kind of mood where I don't really know why I'm alive, but I guess Natalie would say my entire experience and everything I feel is completely irrelevant because there are people who are suffering more. That's what I get for thinking I might have finally found the one person on Earth whose views on gender I actually agree with, but I guess there's just no place for me in any form of politics.",0,0,2018-09-21T06:00:06.000Z

The idea of gender as a performance is pretty intuitive and I liked that analogy about identifying as a doctor.

"I keep watching this video and I really don't understand how it makes me feel. I am someone who has struggled a lot with gender identity and dysphoria my entire life, and witnessing these two viewpoints of gender being performative vs. not performative combat each other seemingly within the same mind made me strangely emotional, because I relate to the swirling chaos of self conflicting arguments and feelings about gender and identity within my own mind. I don't know what I am. I don't know what it means to identify as something. My dysphoria leaves me often wanting to exist in and feeling like I identify with many kinds of bodies. I have wanted to be physically more male and I often feel I need to have a female body. I find my personality very feminine. Am I metrosexual? Nonbinary? Does my sexuality have anything to do with this? I want to fuck and dominate, but also to be fucked and dominated. Do those correlate to masculine and feminine or do they both come from the same places within me? The people i'm around influence who I want to be and what parts of me i'm comfortable with. Does that mean i'm nebulous and fake? I'm sure gender is performative and socialized. I'm sure gender is a lie, a social construct that changes century to century and decade to decade. That gender roles are harmful to everyone involved, and the majority of people stray outside the societal definitions of man and women in some way. Most of the time I feel i'm sure of that. But then where does dysphoria come from? Why do I feel my body would finally fit me if it was smaller and more feminine?

There just isn't a way to say 'I am neither a man or a woman nor any other gender' in aesthetics in a way that is universally understood except to deliberately flaunt the gender binary. and that is, well...something that people who live stealth due to being financially dependent on binarist institutions like me are unable to achieve for the most part.

For those claiming ""this is just a discussion!"" It's not. It's a quiet, active deconstruction of Tabby's viewpoints with little to no similar treatment to Justine. Justine is given more time to speak, has more well rounded arguments, and there are very few times when Tabby can even touch her. 

If society is a play that we all participate in, as posited here, then I cannot create a new role and have it be respected. Who I am is null and void. In the end, I'm just a lazy asshole who doesn't want to bother with the gender binary.

"I only have tomboys pov. I never separated womanhood from a woman based on their level of feminity. I can see how being trans adds a whole other layer to that though. For me, it wasn't about changing myself to fit a certain space but finding the spaces in which I'd thrive. The ones I don't thrive in don't become invalid either they are just another expression of womanhood but neither is the sole expression. The boots close some doors and open others as do the heels but those doors don't determine the person's gender, the person does. Sometimes masculine women hold the door open for feminine women and vice versa and that's where the power lies. Tabby and Justine (crap I probably forgot the chars name already) will have more power as themselves but allied together than they will if one changes and becomes the other. And at no time does one cease to be a woman. That's all fine and good until the dysphoria hits...I can only guess...",1,0,2018-09-21T02:11:34.000Z

"I have to say, Natalie, this is the first video you've done so far (that I've seen) that I don't really agree with, and actually kind of feel is has a problematic message. The main point of this video (that the performance of gender is the basis of gender, and that therefore trans people should work to match that) isn't something everyone agrees on. But more importantly, it puts trans people's identities in the position of being an inherent social/political statement, and therefore whether they pass is a political/social statement.

"I'm a science teacher and the one principle I try to teach my students, above all else, is never stop seeking knowledge. I try to follow the same rule (after all, hypocrisy is the fastest way to lose one's legitimacy) and as such I have sought many ""Social Justice"" channels in an attempt to understand the various perspectives found in the realm intersectionality. Some channels are extremely antagonistic, assuming the audience is either here to reinforce their already-held beliefs, or they are here to antagonize and insult the channel/creator/viewers. Sadly, this is all too often the case, so I don't blame them for the antagonism.

Suffice it to say, your channel is a breath of fresh air among so many stagnant pools of anger and loathing. You are clearly intelligent, but you don't wield that as a club against the uninformed/misinformed. I admire that. You also are willing to yield points that some creators refuse to acknowledge because they seemingly believe that either the ""left"" is totally correct, or it is totally wrong, and yielding any ground would be tantamount to total surrender of their philosophy. Ironically, this attitude is the very thing that causes people to become immovable in their arguments and perspectives. The willingness to ""give-and-take"" in a discussion is a mark of genuine intellectual honesty. Another rare and admirable trait.

"I honestly feel like the proper delineation between Tabby and Justine is the dichotomy of private versus political. Were I a trans woman, the way I would rectify this conflict being that if you're going to try to be a face of a movement, if you're going to willingly present yourself in front of a board of your peers to state your cases then the unfortunate truth is you do more harm than good if you're Tabby and not Justine. However, if some transphobe fuckin misgenders you to insult you while youre just trying to live your life, knock their shit in because you're not asking of anyone anything other than what everyone else wants, to be left the fuck alone to live your life free of harassment and violence in all its forms... AND if they deny you that, they surrender their as well.

It's kind of saddening and gross that this is the most reasonable answer I could personally come up with, but I think it is in fact the most reasonable.

Please note that since I am not trans in any way I am not speaking for any trans person reading this, but it might be possible a trans person might have a difficult time putting into words something similar to my statement here.

Alternate solution: have a cis friend go tabby in your defense while ur justine. I'll do it, I'll protect my friends and loved ones tooth and nail and that includes the trans ones.

"Performing gender has always been very...back and forth with me personally.

I was sexually abused as a kid, and I hid myself under masculine clothing for a long time afterwards because I felt safer. Like I couldn't be a target because I wasn't presenting as feminine, and thus weaker. I cut my hair super short, I wore baggy pants and hoodies, and I never wore makeup. And that didn't make me appealing, and thus I was shunned for it.

Flash forward ten years, and I finally feel comfortable enough with myself to start wearing skirts and growing my hair out and I was in *tears* the first time I put on a long skirt again because it felt so RIGHT and it made me so happy that I could feel comfortable with that again and I felt like I had reclaimed that for myself, because I always loved pink and princesses and all that girly shit, but I finally felt strong enough to let it all out without feeling like I could be weaker for it.

Which opened up a whole new can of worms when I realized I don't really identify as female. I still love to present as feminine, but that always felt... *wrong* in the face of androgyny being the preferred presentation for non-binary, agender people like myself. Doubly so because I'm a chubby bitch and I got a soft bod with what could be called ""feminine"" curves. (That I also took years to love and accept and regain my own self-confidence, but that's another story.)

I seem ""too feminine"" to be non-binary, and I still struggle with that to this day, especially because I'm AFAB. It feels like cheating sometimes. Like I'm cis passing, and I don't want to take hormones or anything, I just identify as agender, and like to be feminine but it feels like I can't do that because then I'm not androgynous enough for the queers and just butch enough to be hated by the cishets for stepping out of the Girl Box because I don't feel the need to shave my legs or perform femininity for the sake of pleasing cishet bro boners.

I guess that's why I lean so heavily into ultra-feminine stuff like Lolita fashion, because it's feminine for the sake of being feminine, and not for the performative pleasure of dudes (though y'all know that cishet dudes will pop a boner at a slight breeze, so damned if I do and damned if I don't I suppose).

At this point I'm just like ""fuck it, I'll do what I want"".

"I feel this is weakened by having Tabby refer not to a materialist account of the enforcement of gender but an extremely liberal model of 'inner truth' and free floating identity. It's especially odd since you have Tabby say the other character (I forget her name) can't account for where trans subjectivity comes from, but leaves herself open to the very same critique of her appeal to 'identity'. Perhaps it serves the needs of the skit, but it kind of limits it to a false dichotomy: a shallow liberal feminism against a shallow reading of Butler. And sure, that's pretty much the state of the 'trans discourse' right now, but let's point beyond it?

To state the point briefly, trans women are made women by the kinds of violence we are subject to, and the kinds of labour we are relegated to perform. That doesn't provide an etiology of transness (and I don't want one) but does point to the functioning of the logic of transmisogyny as a kind of regulatory violence, release valve for the tensions of gendered society, and means to produce a class of abject, disposable people. Though the monstrous figure of the trans woman as horrifying false woman/failed man drives this, it does not exclusively affect out trans women, and can hit us long before we reach the point of articulating womanhood or nonbinariness in our own terms.

You sneer at the 'Tumblr hugbox' in this video, which is a shame, because the debates on that platform - often quite vicious - have gone a long way to hammering out something resembling an adequate theory.

These theoretical points aside, I think the odd thing about the role of Tabby here is that she's clearly very concerned with aesthetics. She wears cat ears! She's playing to an aesthetic norm just as much as the other character, it's just not the norm of talk shows. So her arguments of not caring about aesthetics, and just being true to herself, ring rather hollow.

The biggest limitation, though, is that when Tabby is challenged on referring to oppressive dynamics that don't apply to her, no effort is made by either party to engage with the exclusion from the conversation of anyone but two thin white women. Like, that's part of the limitation of the format I guess, you can only show characters you can perform yourself, but the problem is not 'should white women try to be more respectable' but how to combat the mechanisms that make this a white women's conversation! And the problem with the 'use your privilege' argument taken to mean 'play the part of a presentable middle class white woman on tv' is that we're not just trying to secure liberation for presentable middle class white women, and this is at best all this tactic can achieve. Yes, pay attention to optics, but that doesn't mean regurgitating uncritically the limited narratives we're permitted to present.

Which is to say, it's all spectacle etc. The narratives of trans women on TV are far more in the hands of the producer looking for ratings, and without an enormous amount of care that most of us aren't capable of, it's better to refuse the stage than agree to a rigged 'debate' on whether we deserve to exist (which is to say, on how miserable our existence should be). Should we take the advice, and present respectably, not rise to provocation, etc., we are at the mercy of the other horn of the dilemma: we are caricatures of womanhood etc., or at best get gish galloped into irrelevance. This video makes out, at least in one of the 'contraposed points' (:p), that the problem is insufficiently respectable trans women, not the system that works to centre images of trans women as a chimera of pathetic faggots/violent monsters.

Basically, it is absurd to imagine that all the cause of trans liberation needs is more beautiful white women public figures, and that the only alternative is to performatively threaten people with violence. Neither image will 'work'. Our liberation will not be won in TV debates or through the right public figures.

"I believe I understand the argument that gender can be disassociated from Sex because gender only exists as the reality of whom recognizes it, thus the comparison to a doctor is only really a doctor if everyone recognizes him or her as such. This leads into why ‚Äúpassing‚Äù as a woman for a trans person is so important because they must overcome the barrier of their Sex to legitimize their gender identity. It‚Äôs also why someone calling the Cat-person (I‚Äôm confused actually what this character represents) a man has such power: because the only thing making CatPerson a woman is everyone recognizing CatPerson as one.

The rebuttal is where my question comes though. Both characters affirm eachother as women despite being Sexually males. However, wouldn‚Äôt the value of this entirely depend upon a shared value of Humanism whereby the individual‚Äôs uniqueness has a right to protection/existence in society and the individuals are the ultimate arbiters of norms and morality? I raise this question because if the basis for affirming trans identity rests on the humanist premise, then it would be open to the same criticisms humanism at large would be.

Sex is physical, you can reproduce with a womb, and a female egg, and this requires a male to do so, this is important - this is how the sexes are defined literally behind the many coloured glasses that we have. And no amount of abuse or psychological reconditioning can undo this, it is reality. The only solution is that since the sexes are physically definitive, as in we can technically break down the bodily differences that include even all of the information in the sex differentiated chromosomes, that the body can be fully changed. The problem for transgendered women is two; one that many transgender women merely identify as a woman, hence they do not want sex reassignment surgery. The second is that true sex change does not yet exist. Those who change sex do not have true female genitals, wombs do not exist for this process yet, they will never be able to give birth until this is a reality. And their chromosomes have not changed.

Though it is arguable whether changing chromosomes is truly so important to the process, you may be able to have all the sex characteristics of the opposite gender, working genitals, hormone therapy, etc, without really touching on any of the male or female chromosomes. Though,  that word again, even changing entire chromosomes is not unrealistic. We're getting pretty good at changing the genes of living things. How long do you think that would take to become a reality for us? I'm optimistic. And call me shallow, but the riddle of human mortality was more important to me that getting a more legit vaginal implant.

Why would I be affected by my sex so much if I knew that time is the only thing working against me? I'd rather spend my time thinking of how to live for a few more hundred years, or even more arrogantly, a lot longer than that. If you can do that, all your dreams follow. You will have all the time in the world to completely change sex. It will be an age where our physical differences are choices, superficial, being male, or female, will become blurry, and less meaningful. You can be anything that you desire, you can reproduce any way, with better results than natural selection could ever give you.

What happens then? Will people freely swap their sex in their hundreds of year lives to explore all reality has to offer? Will being a woman, or a man, become merely a phase in their long life? These things put into question our values toward these ideals.",0,1,2018-09-20T22:09:30.000Z

"""I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses, but if no one recognizes me as a doctor then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?"", 

So...I realize this is pretty much a throwaway line used for rhetorical effect, but it's a bit troubling to me because it reinforces the misconception of (Western) medical practice as an exclusively professional domain - which is not only ahistorical, but erases the lived experience and labour of many chronic patients.

This reframing of medicine, which has largely taken place over the last 200-300 years, neglects the integral and often cooperative roles that have been played by empiric, magico-religious, community and self-healers since the Middle Ages - to the point that patients engaging with practices of self-medicine within digital contexts are regularly represented as an entirely new phenomenon, rather than part of a continuous history of medicine as a system of diverse and loosely integrated practices. 

Conversely, medical historians and postmodern philosophers of medicine - when they bother to address patient roles at all - tend to approach patients since modernity as passive objects lacking entirely in agency since ""their self-perceptions are themselves medically contaminated"" - but again, this is inaccurate because it ignores the widespread and largely invisible labour of self-medicine that has always been a crucial part of chronic patienthood. (I think it's also worth considering how defining medicine-in-practice in professional terms erases its inherently social and interactional nature - regardless of whether they engage in community- or self-diagnosis and treatment, patients are nonethless practitioners of medicine.) 

Sorry - this feels like kind of a trivial nitpick, but given the nebulous nature of this dialogue and the ways in which disabled perspectives are often rendered invisible in a lot of leftist discourse and philosophy, it feels important to me to call attention to the fact that practices of medicine are similarly not nearly as cut-and-dried as they're often represented, and as they seem to be represented here.",5,0,2018-09-20T22:04:23.000Z

"i am a cis lesbian and this a video that seems pretty intracommunity, but i want to say that, at least for me, i think womanhood is a trap for everyone involved. the efforts required to be ""successfully"" feminine are beyond me. i can see every day what other women are doing that i am not, and it looks effortless and alluring and often attractive, and i'm torn between being happy for them and this yearning to perform femininity to that extent. i'm definitely not gnc, but i feel as though i'm failing to be ""good"" at being feminine. there are certain feminine trappings for every kind of style from the ultra femme glam makeup efforts to the ""i rolled out of bed with sweatpants"" and i don't feel as though i fit into any of them well. i just feel fat and ugly and although i would like to be more ""successfully"" feminine, focusing on my features long enough to put on makeup or try on close just makes me hate myself even more and feeds my dysmorphia. it's a constant thing i deal with and while i do feel as though i'm a woman, i don't fit comfortable in nonbinary conceptions of identity, and i'm definitely not a trans guy, i just... feel like a failed woman. and i feel like it all the time. i don't know if it's relevant but it's true, and i think it's the result of womanhood as a social category emphasizing the aesthetics of women's appearances. it's a struggle every day.",4,1,2018-09-20T21:32:33.000Z
"Love the video, but I have one nitpick: the Idea that there is an alternance of enlightenment and aesthetic eras doesn't seem to bear out. The epoch of Athene philosophers was also the time of the development of the classsical greek style. Sure it expanded later on with the hellenistic style , but so did philosophy. When christianity solidified in terms of thinkers and conservation of knowledge, christian art became more elaborate as well. The renaissance is a time of thinkers and artists. Aesthetics are enlightenment.
The reality is more a back and forth of minimalism and extravagance (classical greek and hellenistic, early renaissance and mannerism, classical and baroque, hippie and punk etc... But minimalism isn't any less aesthetic as a dogma than extravagance is.

The truth, of course, lies in between. 
Gender is real and internal, but how we perform it matters. 
What isn't touched on here is code-switching. 
There are times and places when those of us privileged with the option need to pass. For our safety. For political impact. 
Then, there are times and places when highlighting our difference is a more powerful option. When expanding ideas about gender can help to create safer spaces for people who don't conform, and never will, whether they're cis or trans. When we can do more by scaring the horses than by calming them.

Your videos taught me that we can examine all the messy and complicated facts of a situation, open-mindedly and with nuance, and STILL take a hard stance in favor of what's right, and in favor of changing the world for the better. I could be misinterpreting things, but it seems like this video is saying, instead, that we might as well resign ourselves to the fact that the world is a horrible place that judges people by how they look and treats GNC people badly so we might as well just go along with it because we have no hope of changing it. But that's not true. We DO. At least from what I've seen, the world has already become more accepting of GNC people than it was when I was in high school 10 years ago. Everyday at my job, I see groups of teenagers come in, groups including not only conventional-looking girls and guys, but also effeminate dudes, butch girls, and possible nonbinary kids---all laughing together and clearly supporting each other as friends. I know there's still a long way to go, but we can do this. We're not doomed to live in a shallow, judgmental world forever.

"A few years ago one of my best friends from hs transitioned from m2f.

She moved away not too long after that and we still speak. The reason I bring this up is because I had a genuine want to know more but during her transition, didn't want to berate her with my questions (really, I wouldn't want to bother someone with my questions if they weren't comfortable with bringing it up themselves) knowing how difficult initial transitioning is. So as a straight (brown) male these videos give me such a deep look at one person's perspective and experience as a trans woman, and helps me understand the struggle and real threats society aims at trans people.

We don't live in a perfect world, however, and the subterfuge and need to be something that society will accept and validate is always present. This is true for everyone and we all go out of our way to conform to the aesthetic demands of society (regardless of trans or cis status)... so the uh... more feminine one has the strongest point.

BTW, this is also the exact point that Jordan Peterson is regularly bashed for making.

"""The world we live in is not a philosophical world.

Lemme illustrate this with the least related piece of pop culture possible:

The rap beef between MGK and Eminem. Who won and why? What matters more, content or presentation?

It started on twitter like 6 years ago. ""Machine Gun Kelly"" had an ""its just a joke man!"" Moment at Eminem's expense. Was he joking? Nobody really knows, but Marshall Mathers took this up through his media connections, allegedly getting MGK's album deal pulled over a comment about Mathers' daughter ""made in jest"".

Okay. Fast forward to like two weeks ago. Eminem drops an album calling out every rapper that he's ever had any hint of a problem with. 45 year old white boys apparently like starting fights.

MGK had a bit of a spotlight for most of a song. It was probably the worst put together song that Eminem has ever done. The flow was janky, the beat was cacaphonic, and to top it off, Eminem leaves himself open to serious correction.

Days later (not years)/MGK responds with his *best put together song ever*, Rap Devil. It calls out Eminem about factual inaccuracies, laying out the embarassing facts of the beef, attacking Eminem's lifestyle as that of an irresponsible father, and more braggadocio. This mumble rapper suddenly can flow.

Days later, Eminem responds with Killshot - a fast paced, fame-bragging, mischaracterizing assault positively built on a foundation of insincere threats of violence. But holy shit that flow was amazing. Eminem should take Machine gun Kelly's name, the way this fast paced diss rap just cuts at MGK... The beat? Is just the beat for rap devil played backwards.

Who then responds with *Legshot* - so named because of Eminem's perfect aim in ""Killshot"" at a freaking strawman. Guess who's flow is janky, off kilter now? Laying down honesty, pointing out the fallacies, and coming back with what amounts to ""yeah, youre not gonna do shit"" while slinging his own bravado and empty threats of violence, MGK fired back.

No matter how much MGK actually had the truth on his side in the music... He fell short musically. In the pretend violent world of world-class white boy rap, Eminem's ability to flow simply outclassed the upstart. 

And having Fallout boy fans pose for his pic (MGK was the opening act) without telling them why? Only made *them* angry, and point out the dishonesty to the rest of the public. He got booed off stage.

So now, in trying to appear to have more support, MGK just shot his own leg. The mumble rapper seems to have put himself down.

See how very little of this has to do with Truth directly, but more *The Perception of Truth*, and how much more with Presentation? Quite literally the entire world is judging over Youtube.

But seriously - Donald Trump is President, and the greatest rapper *Ever* is apparently Eminem, and he just defended that title against a goddamned Mumble Rapper *with a fucking strawman*.

*If God is dead, then truth is on life support, moving to hospice care next week*.

"It's always interesting to watch binary trans folks hashing out identity v aesthetics, because gender is very centered in performance, for me, but as a nonbinary AFAB person who hasn't medically transitioned, my ideal performance of gender only appears transgressive when performed by people who look like men.  My femme impulses are just read as womanhood, which makes me dysphoric, because my internal reality isn't recognized by external society.

So, like, I'm technically safer, because I ""pass"" as a cis woman, but that act of passing makes my dysphoria worse.  I want to be seen as gender-nonconforming, but for an AFAB person, that is implied to mean masculinity.

The discrepansy between who I am and who I perform being only becomes obvious after I've taken certain actions, such as chanting out loud at a bar, taking charge or pretending to care about sports. The oddness for me then comes with the fact that I to begin with wanted to flee performed femininity, but when I now project feminine characteristics (by wearing make-up or being flamboyant) I feel at ease somehow, because it's no longer needed for me to do it, rather, it's an option - now that I am male, femininity does not negate my maleness, in the same way as maleness negates femininity.",0,0,2018-09-20T16:43:59.000Z

"I love this channel but this video made me uncomfortable. I am and most of my trans friends are non-passing and many are non-conforming. Tabby might be comparatively less done up than Justine but she's still a good deal closer to passing and more femme presenting than most of the trans women I know, most of whom WANT to pass or blend in. I know much of the dialogue here is tongue in cheek but when Tabby spoke about the ""women with facial hair who no one will stick up for"" or whatever it was it felt clear that  there was a missing party in the room. Tabby doesn't represent gender non conforming trans woman ; she sympathizes with them, she ""sticks up"" for them but this is still two people (who are the same person) talking about a whole lot of people behind their collective back. I felt like a lot of the debate here had the subtext that trans woman who don't pass (or aren't trying) either don't want to or are at an early stage in their transition but that just isn't true. for a lot of trans women passing isn't an option and the amount of daily strain it takes, the relentless self criticism and monitoring and discipline it takes to ATTEMPT to pass, to present 24/7 just isn't feasible or compatible with our lives. If Justine had said those words I would accept it but coming from Tabby it felt back handed and kind of condescending. It undercut what I assume the video was trying to say. I thought it was really brave of Natalie to talk about about her struggle with internalized trans-phobia in the incels video but I in trying to spin those emotions into satire I feel like she is over-extending the range of perspectives her current menagerie of characters can convey. I know these videos are satirical entertainment and Natalie doesn't present herself to be anything close to objective I just wanted to put my feelings out there.",49,2,2018-09-20T16:21:14.000Z
"Hi, very interesting video as always.  I'd just like to say that this whole argument of internal experience vs. the aesthetic of passing completely ignores and sidelines nonbinary folx, who being not conforming to the gender binary by definition can't ""pass""; society has no pre-defined role for someone who isn't a man or a woman, and thus one can't really perform such an aesthetic. So though Butler's idea of gender as performative is useful, it's not complete. One cannot perform a nonbinary gender except through noncomformance to the binary genders, which in its nature is an act outside of the norms of society which defines gender. 

I know you're talking here from your own experience of (I assume) a binary trans woman, but the way your debate is framed really erases the experience of nonbinary people, which indicates a shortcoming in the theoretical framework you've presented.",4,0,2018-09-20T16:17:59.000Z

"I've been subscribed to Contrapoints for some years now, and I think it might be one of the first time I regretted watching a video. Of course, it might just be the specific headspace I've been in these past few days, but that video left me rather... well, I suppose sad, but not exactly so. Now, the video was very well produced and a good dialogue for the most part. However, the overall tone feels a lot more melancholic than Natalie's other videos. There seems to be an air of resignation which lingers over the entire thing. Tabby is presented as being the sole representative of a community which is otherwise non-existent while Justine, who has by far the more pessimistic view, is presented as being mostly overwhelming and omnipresent. It feels as though the result is a dichotomy between martyrdom and self-erasure where middle-ground or change isn't achievable. I also find it difficult to accept Justine's point of view as tolerable when it, according to Tabby, involves her mocking Tabby behind her back. Adopting a socially friendly appearance and demeanor is one thing but using marginalized people as a way to prompt yourself up is just downright awful.

These issues are only compounded by the sour ending of the conversation where the two of them watch what I take to be a representation of the current climate, at least the one on the internet. I do agree that it is bad, but to focus solely on the Justine side of the issue makes the situation look absolutely hopeless. It seemed as though the final message was that things are terrible and they will always be terrible and the only way out is to adopt a veneer of conformity, that is if adopting said veneer is even possible.

Normally, I wouldn't mind a bitter video, but I fear that it might send a very negative message to questioning people, those early in their transition, and the non-passing people. And, I think that of anyone, these people aren't really in need a negative outlook given how they probably experience most of what is described here. Anyways, those were just my thoughts. I guess putting them on paper helped me some.",141,13,2018-09-20T16:10:53.000Z

It brings to mind, though, how much ""act more feminine and you'll be discriminated against less"" is, to lesser degrees, a huge issue for all sorts of marginalized women. When lesbianism, fatness, blackness are ""unfeminine"", how do gay, fat, and Black trans women even achieve that acceptance? And when femininity is being quiet, submissive, and agreeable, as it often is, how are trans women (or other marginalized women) ever meant to do anything with the relative power they can achieve through optics?

"I loved this video, but may I humbly add a thought I had? While acting and looking ultra feminine like Justine garners acceptance from society at large, being contrary to that also garners a certain recognition from society. Being a tabby makes society reject you, but is this truly a negative when the result is expected? Why not be a Daria instead of a Quinn? Not caring how you look IS a look too. It conveys, inevitably, a message of Independence, when rebelliousness. And there is power in that too, I think. Perhaps we got this wrong, and there is a space for both Justine and Tabby. What I don't get, and perhaps that's the point, is how acutely aesthetic Tabby is, how aesthetic being on the fringe is. If aesthetic is the expression of the self, it means it needs an audience, it's defined by the expectator, society, but also by the performer. Thus identity is the wish to perform?

"I think dissociating aesthetics from womanhood further proves the ambiguity of the identity, which further complicates the demand to be 'treated as a woman'. 
In other words, if we go with Kitty's (is that her name?) idea, then we should accept her as a woman merely because that's what she wants, not because she performs in any way that is inherently womanly. In other words, the necessary and sufficient condition for womanhood is self-identification as such, in her view. But how does this fit into any sort of political demand for equal treatment of women, or an private demand of a particular individual to be more respectful to Kitty as a woman? Kitty will inevitably have different standards than Justine for what it means to be respected as a woman, no? 
And if the point I'm making sounds like bullshit because 'it shouldn't be that hard, Jordan, to just respect a woman', then I feel like you're indirectly RELYING on aesthetics to make your case. The only way it could be obvious to me is if I rely on some intuitive sense of what is universally womanly. Where could such a sense come from if not an aesthetic vantage?
Basically, I don't think we can escape aesthetics. I think the reliance on the idea of womanhood is a placeholder for a more sophisticated strata of identification, and that eventually there will be a normalized sense of experimentation, self-exploration, and self-discovery, that will allow room for somebody like Kitty to transcend the need for 'womanhood' and own a more specialized, personalized term or set of terms for her identity, one that fits with her aesthetic.
So, I'm saying that aesthetics are unavoidable, but that that is ultimately a great thing about humanity, and it is being taken advantage of by the perceived gender binary. This abuse forces people like Kitty to try to fit into the binary by relying on one of its two labels while also combating the binary by heralding self-identification. I don't know the way out of such a system, so I don't blame Kitty for inadvertently perpetuating it, but I'm not sure that her strategy is really what will liberate humanity.

I love Dr. Butler‚Äôs work, but it also needs to be said that there are a host of other activists and academics who have conflicting theories on gender and performativity in particular. I know that Nat is focusing on trans women, and as a trans man a lot of this resonates, but even though this is presented as kind of ? a debate ? it feels like there‚Äôs still some nuance that‚Äôs missing. I disagree heartily with Justine, and don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs right, but the presentation makes it seem like Justine is ultimately right.

"I kind of get what you could be going for with this, but it came off as pretty alienating. There‚Äôs an imbalance of respectability with the two characters and Justine seemed to say more overall. The point of accepting and then putting aside their differences was weak and felt too late. 

I understand very well that one can‚Äôt expect others to give a damn, and the only person that can change how others see you is yourself, but some trans folks have it much harder than being able to pass with a couple hours of makeup and dressing the right way. Some, no matter what they do, won‚Äôt ‚Äúpass‚Äù without spending money (that they don‚Äôt have, so can‚Äôt spend), and even with surgeries some won‚Äôt ‚Äúmake it‚Äù. 

Maybe this video will motivate some people to try harder and they‚Äôll see some positive results in their lives, but I‚Äôve always felt the idea of being a ‚ÄúGood Trans‚Äù is very insidious and harmful.

And if other people don't accept a person's identity, it's the people's fault, not the individual's presentation of their identity. Don't pander to people who are skeptical of a person's gender identity. Act however the fuck you want, and if people don't accept your identity, that's their problem, not yours.

I make sure to present as a version of me. How ever fancy or casual my clothes or make up is. They are tools I can use to appear how I want to, depending on who I'm going to see

And if I choose to not use them most days. That decison is an informed one, being aware of what I am or am not doing when I leave the house.

"Not exactly the same but my attempt at relating: As someone that has finally in my late thirtees come to terms with the fact that I have autism I to a very high degree have stopped to try and _pass_ for neurotypical. I can impossibly fit into this world built by and for neurotypicals so why bother trying? Luckily for me autism is relatively invisible on a surface level which means I _can_ pass for ""quiet loner"" by sitting down and shutting the hell up but I don't really see why I have to, and frankly I don't want to.

Sure this makes me socially shunned and I have never been able to keep a regular job - but living the lie, using up all of the little energy I have at my disposal acting like I am expected to just plunges me into depression over and over again. Conforming to me is prison of drainage and belonging to any kind of group has never been a thing for me. Perhaps I can only understand it on a theoretical level; I have never felt it or even felt the urge for it other than under the threat of violence (see grade school). I am done with it.

I understand that very few people is in a position where they can cut out both social functions and work in a traditional sense so, while I will most probably feel alienated from society all my life, forever battling the depression it imposes on you, I feel lucky in that I am privilegied enough to be able to live expressing this level of honesty right now. While making a living is immensely difficult I am however certain that no-one will try to kill me for a having a sensory overload-related meltdown in a busy supermarket.

"I don't think either Justine or Tabby or meant to be ""right."" I think they are thesis and antithesis, a sort of debate between two wrong extremes and we're meant to puzzle out the truth from the union of the two, like mixing the two flasks at the beginning.

My take, Justine is right in that we live in an age of spectacle. We have to live in that reality. Tabby is right that it is unjust and it is important to recognize that that is unjust. Its not the best idea to threaten Ben Shapiro or TERFs even if they deserve it.

At the risk of going outside my lane, this is not entirely different from debates between folks like WEB Dubois and Booker T. Washington about living as a black person and navigating a world where your oppressors set the terms and the framing.

Or more of a pop culture reference, its like the debate between Magneto and Professor X.

I think Magneto and Tabby are very seductive and channel the completely justified and necessary wrath but it has to be tempered with the understanding that the whole affair is theater, a circus. Tabby is necessary but it uses credibility. Justine is necessary too. Justine builds credibility that tabby can use. A dark knight and a white night. Combat boots and heels. Guns and Ammo.

"As a cis gendered woman, this video does make me realize the real privilege I live with. I‚Äôve never been a tomboy - I‚Äôve never gone out of my way to be masculine or pursue a stereotypically masculine profession. But I‚Äôve rarely put any effort into being feminine either, aside from removing facial hair once a week or two. I hardly ever wear makeup, I don‚Äôt like wearing skirts or dresses much, I don‚Äôt own any leggings,  and I tend to wear neutral or masculine-ish clothes, some of which are hand-me-downs from my boyfriend, who favours athletic wear. And yet I can take for granted that my womanhood will be recognized - that I‚Äôm very unlikely to be mistaken for a man in person (thanks to XX chromosomes,  a pituitary gland and sex organs that did all the legwork without me having to worry about it much at all), or on paper for that matter (thanks to my obviously feminine name, given to me by my parents). And if someone calls me ‚Äòsir‚Äô on the phone because my voice might be a bit low, it‚Äôs something I can just laugh off. I can afford not to worry about, view it as a threat, or feel a stab at my identity. All of that is the privilege of being a cis woman in society.

I‚Äôm glad to see videos like this. Although they‚Äôre certainly not intended for my ‚Äúcis-y‚Äù benefit,  they make me realize how thin of a ledge a trans woman might feel like they‚Äôre balancing on. I feel like Tabby should be right in a just world, but Justine knows the world is not just at all. As long as cisgender norms continue to dominate, a trans woman may feel compelled to not only perform womanhood, but to over-perform, to be The Woman, hoping to escape the fear that all the effort to transition will somehow be Sisyphean (cis-y-fee-in?).

"There are two underlying factors that I believe are being neglected or glossed over in this discussion:  genetic advantage and socio-economic privilege.  Genetic makeup plays a big part in whether or not a person has attractive features (sure some aspects of attractiveness can be subjective, but let's be honest, there are definitely objective biological factors rooted in what we find attractive).  So if you win the genetic lottery--so to speak--and have features that are in line with what is considered aesthetically pleasing (tall, slim/skinny, pleasant facial structure, healthy, etc.) then you will have a much better chance of being judged favorably and accepted by society, regardless of what gender you identify/present as.

As for the economic factor, if you don't have the looks but you have wealth and privilege, you can use those resources to 'enhance' yourself in ways that help make up for whatever may be lacking.  Of course, if you have both a genetic and economic advantage, then you have the means to forge your way in society without question.  If you don't have that genetic or economic privilege, though, then you have a much more difficult time being accepted no matter what gender you consider yourself.

Most truly passable trans women were lucky enough to have a running start with the ideal genetic material, and thus would be considered aesthetically pleasing as male or female (just look at before and after photos).  Many of them also had the economic resources to not only follow through with an expensive transition process, but to also maintain their aesthetic on a constant basis.  But people will gloss over this truth and instead choose to promote the false ideal of ""you could have what I have, you just have to work for it"".  Well, many people don't have the naturally good looks, or the means to pay for expensive treatments and operations, or the never-ending supply of high-quality makeup needed to pull off a look at the level of what CP does in these videos.  It is disingenuous to have such lofty debates on aesthetics and gender perception in society without acknowledging the under-lying realities of certain biological and socio-economic privileges, of which most people have little-to-no control over.

FWIW: Despite this criticism, I thoroughly enjoyed the video and it addressed many points that have been bouncing around in my mind recently.",20,2,2018-09-20T10:07:00.000Z

"I really like this video cause it's showing me that I'm sliding away from Tabby's pov and more towards Justine's. I'm a black genderqueer guy who's been performing ""white"" femininity my whole damn life. Hightening my naturally deep voice, shaving my facial hair, learning to hide my hair under makeup, all things I had to do to exist undisturbed as a black female teenager, and now that I'm on hrt I legit have no idea how masculinity is performed. 

Gender is a performance for me, always has been and always will be so long as the constructs of what gender is are based on perception. I'm not going to go all truscumy like Justine and demand other non conforming trans ppl to assimilate, but I'm also not really appreciating the idea that perception and performance have nothing to do with how gender is constructed. Because that's how I construct what gender is (my gender not so much other ppl's).

Anyway this video made me sad that I wasn't raised a guy so I knew how to perform black masculinity as I'm transitioning right now, but this was also very illuminating to my own internal struggles that I didn't know I had.

"""Sir"" is a term that refers to nobles and the thanes. Referring to a commoner as though they are a blue blood is treason in countries ruled over by a monarch. While in Canada, such a law is not enforced--treason is committed regularly up here as a side effect. The law is based upon the notion you should just know who the local blue bloods are.

When I get sir'd I remind people that I am a commoner and not a blue blood--and I will not take part in this treason. Though... I have recently been informed there is a chance my Grandfather on my dad's side MIGHT have gotten to an officers rank in the British Airforce... so... I might not be able to do that as much. I still do not think it is enough to have me being a blue blood and thus able to be called ""sir"" or ""dame""... but that doubt has opened room to have people suggest that I am a blue blood... and it is irritating.

I would suggest that Tabby (who looks extremely feminine as far as I'm concerned... but like... the AWESOME women I've known) look into how sir has connections to suggesting a noble rank, and the systems that recognising blue blood would enforce and go THAT angle. I mean... it is technically treason to sir somebody in Canada, Australia, the UK, Ireland, Scotland, etc... it... it just is not enforced (unless it is the local ruling monarch--only they can sir somebody--and at that point the person sir'd would become a blue blood).",3,0,2018-09-20T09:05:23.000Z

"GUYS! STOP IT! sorry GENDER NON-SPECIFIC GUYS! STOP IT! I have no business telling individual trans people how to present themselves or pursue acceptance, but all I want to do is burst out singing ""Cat girl, you don't need to put on those high heels!"". We don't need to be accepted by the majority of people. A lot of political action can be accomplished just by appealing to fringe radicals; that was the main lesson of the past couple years. Tabby is the one who speaks to fringe radicals, so she's going to get further. This is war; we can't waste our time trying to pander to those who never will accept us. You do that, next thing you know, creepy MRAs are going to be holding trans women above cis women because they're the only ones satisfactorily complying with their ideals of femininity. If you allow for that kind of culture, it will never invalidate your gender identity, but it is shitty and against girl code. All we can do is recognize that each of us has the prerogative to seize power and enforce our own vision of morality. That's the only philosophy I think can exist, in the long run. And we just have to cross our fingers that the moral code that prevails isn't bigoted.

So I guess I side with Tabby. Heels and make up are a perfectly fine way to express femininity if that's just the kind of girl you are. But if you try to make it about fitting in for acceptance, you're being complacent with the patriarchy. I get that you don't want to get murdered, but neither did those girls who couldn't (/didn't want to) doll herself up. If you ask me, rule #1 of what it means to be a woman is that you don't sell out your sisters.

Then again I became a cam girl just to pay rent, so... stones... glass houses... Really, my answer to this question is my answer to any question of praxis: ""STOP BICKERING ABOUT HYPOTHETICALs. We all know transphobia is wrong, so this is clearly not a question of ""should"" but ""can"". In which case, just assemble a team of game theorists, economists, political scientists, and military scientists. And run the numbers to estimate the least amount of pandering to centrism necessary for victory. It's not about feels. It's not about reals. Power is a numbers game.

"I don't know what this will or won't add to the conversation but i guess i finally feel i should type it out. I started watching you in early August this year and i can't remember what the first video i watched was called but it was a couple months old, i believe you had pretty recently started your transition. 

What confused me and made my unsettled for the first half of it at least was that i couldn't determine your gender. When you walked you walked much like a man but there were sudden 'feminine' movements. You sounded both as a man and woman at the same time, your face 'looked' feminine but 'was' that of a man. 

I have Asperberger's among other things and can't tell people apart. So i rely on general observations off movement and unconscious behavior to help determine who a person is and what gender they are. That was why i noticed the discrepancies in you and also why it unsettled me - i had never encountered someone who was someone and no one at the same time, who was neither a man or a woman yet both.

Somewhere around the middle of the video you casually mentioned that you where Trans and suddenly things started making more sense. Ever since you have slowly moved more and more to the feminine side and it gets harder to tell that you're biologically a man. The most notable giveaway has always been your neck/shoulder bones. Men and women have a rather significant different in the construction of their shoulder/neck bones and yours have been particular notable, maybe because it's such a stark contrast to the image you present.

However i'm 'pleased' (?) to announce that in today's video that wasn't evident anymore! +1 feminine point for you or something! It has, and still is, quite enjoyable to see you grow and evolve to be and feel less 'man' for each video. 

Again i don't know what i want to say with this but now i've said it i guess? Despite how this might seem i harbor no ill intent against you or anyone else in the same situation. Whelp that's enough rambling for now - aretgagegretghbtrjhtry! And have a wonderful day!",0,0,2018-09-20T08:43:58.000Z

"I am a conventionally attractive cis woman in my early 20s. In the past year I started to perform femininity and it‚Äôs incredible how much my day to day life has changed. I am one of the lucky ones.

But we as women, carriers of femininity, are taught to see attention and love with a scarcity mentality. We are made fight one another for attention, and our girlhood cards can be revoked at any moment if we ever become too outspoken, too smart, too old, too pregnant, too fat, too thin, too skinny, too curvy, too dark skinned, too exotic, if we wear the wrong kind of clothes or decide to let our hair go natural.

I am one of those who benefit from this situation, but it still feels like a goddamn cage. I am not the one in control, because my power can be revoked at any time if only I become too something or not enough something else. Patriarchy always has the power, even if rich men buy me drinks and expensive jewelry.

I am with Tabby on this debate because I think what needs to be fought is the scarcity mentality: let‚Äôs work for a society where there is enough love, success and attention for all women in their beautiful weird forms, not just for those who perform well.

Nevertheless, this video is incredible. There is clearly a lot of personal struggle behind it, and I can only imagine the courage it took to put it out there. I love your content Natalie, and I hope you can get to a place of self love that makes you feel secure and worthy, no matter the makeup or the shoes.

As a private individual who isn‚Äôt answering to stockholders or fans, looks should only be a personal expression. 
Actions are more important than subjective attractiveness. One good friend/partner is more useful than acceptance from a group of strangers.

If the others see Blaire as the winner of the debate, they will still see it this way even if you change your looks. It‚Äòs fixed from the beginning.
Also: That scene with Shapiro and Jenner was amazing. He provoked her so bad and she reacted the way he wanted her to be. That‚Äòs how fascists win debates - by personally attacking the other party so they look bad and become defensive. And the chromosome argument is the dumbest argument ever...

I don't *know* I'm a woman the way Tabby does, but I pretty much can't avoid being gendered that way because my massive chest makes it clear I'm AFAB. But even though I feel extremely uncomfortable with that, I don't get points for being feminine either because I perform it incorrectly and inconsistently. If gender is just what people perceive you to be, that means there's effectively only men and women, because it's not common to assume somebody is in any other category, right? So I guess no point except that if that's the way it is, that's pretty depressing. If gender is a social construct, it would be nice if we got together to construct another option.

"I'm not going to reference anything personal and instead talk about how i am currently reading nietzsche, which is maybe relevant to your discussion (particularly of Butler). ""Granted that we want the truth: why not rather untruth?"" In Beyond Good And Evil there are a lot of sections where he seems to be taking aim at the subject as a concept (Aphorisms 16, 17, and 19). He also seems to uphold the idea that a set of beliefs being refutable is not necessarily a cause to abandon them entirely (ie. ""the eternal feminine""): ""It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts more subtle minds"". I see these concepts as being connected to performativity as Butler puts it. I guess ultimately what made me write this comment was the way I felt that some of these points weren't necessarily referenced in such a dry way as I'm doing here now, but acted out in the way that Tabby and Natalie acknowledge a certain degree of validity in each other's positions despite each making it clear that the other's views are untrue...a performance of perfomativity...a metaperformative...whatever it's midnight thirty my brain hurts and i'm not that smart. i had work all afternoon. this is not worth reading. also i haven't finished the book yet so don't spoil it.

"You are talking about gender identity, which one might argue is a social construct.
We should be specific rather than using the more ambiguous term gender. The term gender necessarily has biological implications and that will remain true as long as the vast majority of humanity reproduces sexually.

Male and female behavior is not all entirely nurture...very clearly the evidence shows there is a significant amount of nature involved. Hence the need for a social recognition in the biological distinctions between male and female. 

At the end of the day that is what this debate is, nature vs nurture.

If you are born a man you can't just completely nurture that away...sorry but that is not how biology works.


If you are misgendered because of pronouns that does not equal any violation of your rights, your gender identity is not explicitly yours and it has a social context. Otherwise, you are arguing that gender is not a social construct but rather a personal one.

Your individual identity is explicitly yours, and no one has a right to insist you are someone you are not...but if someone does not use words you feel like you deserve that is not a criminal offense.",0,2,2018-09-20T07:33:53.000Z
"The key difference here is the difference between Acceptance, and Assimilation.  Those seeking assimilation want to send the message that they won't rock the boat if they get let into the club.  That they wont challenge the existing power structure, they just don't want to be left outside anymore.  Overwhelmingly, the messaging tends to be subservient, since that's typically what power demands.  Those of us who seek acceptance, want to rewrite the rules that are excluding us, to challenge power and to lessen its ability to exclude marginalized people in the first place.

In particular we need to smash cis hyper-masculinity and cis hyper-femininity. No cis women can be as hyper-fem as society currently requires without an enormous amount of wasteful and expensive work. Since cis women can't make it, why should trans women go to extraordinary lengths?

"Extrapolating this whole video to the arena of politics has me reaching horribly depressing conclusions.

If we live in an age where most people act around aesthetics first then aren't we basically a dead species? Our world and our aesthetics are so grounded in capitalism that we'll be banning plastic straws and manufacturing ""green"" cars until the planet bakes us all to death.

You ultimately can't make lower consumption appealing under capitalism, since so much of our ""happiness"" (for lack of a better word) is tied to consumption. The alternative (socialism) allows for vastly less material consumption but its not aesthetically pleasing either, and the arbiters of what we see as acceptable have been opposed to socialism since it's inception.

Since ultimately capitalism is what's driving environmental change and since nothing about capitalism is geared up to stopping this, if we live in an age where people act based on looks rather than some deeper sense of self or community, then we're basically dead.

"I personally don‚Äôt think that I, nor Contra, can ever ACTUALLY *BE* A WOMAN. I think we can only mimick women and what we and society thinks women are. As far as I understand it, a scientist could take a sample of my spit and tell me what gender I am with an accuracy of 99.7% and until the science arrives where we can change our DNA then we will be stuck as mere imitation women. Which I think should be acceptable to everyone. That‚Äôs NOT to say that the ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù cannot be achieved to where others either don‚Äôt see us as men, or see we are men and still agree to act as though we were women. 

Even after the hormones and the surgeries, there is something biologically essential to gender and sex. Trans people are anomalous and should not be the standard which all else is judged. It should be, as rightfully is, the reverse standard.  
I‚Äôm not sure which parts of that people will disagree with, but I am just laying out what I think is apparent as a male human. Regardless, I‚Äôd still refer to Contra as a woman just to not be a dick head. Though there could be some line that I won‚Äôt cross in that regard. Not sure what that could be.

"Where I live, when men say ""I respect women"" it mostly means they respect a union of their very narrow definition of biology, performative femininity, and standards of behavior. The moment you step outside any of that, you're robbed of your womanhood in their eyes, which is like tearing away a disguise for them, and with it - respect that should be default for any human being. That's why they beat us, but ""would have never hit a woman"". So it's pretty much impossible to consider womanhood as aesthetical or outward thing, here. It's an inside job.

here are my thoughts, as a trans man.
i was raised as a woman. i came out at 16. it fucking sucked.
i still like ""feminine"" things like makeup, jewelry, bright colors, etc. but i dont let myself wear tht shit in public. trans men and trans women are expected to be the absolute peak of masculinity and femininity, otherwise we're ""faking it"" or we're just not trans enough. tht being said, while my life as a trans man isnt easy, i know it will get easier as i transition bc i will look more like a cis man.
its so much different for trans women bc of the misogyny in our society. trans women and trans men face transphobia, but trans women get the added bonus of transmisogyny. if i dont completely pass in public, i just look like a butch woman. for the most part, ppl leave me alone. if a trans woman doesnt pass completely in public, she'll be harassed.

"I think an interesting point I'd like to add is that acceptance of trans people (but only if they pass), really serves to reinforce the gender binary. I've spent time on trans forums, and I personally feel that a lot of people who could arguably be genderfluid or non-conforming are overwhelming informed that the solution to all of their negative feelings is to transition. Only then can you join this community of people who have a set of extremely specific commonalities. Unfortunately this almost universally includes using depression/dysphoria/social anxiety as fodder for making friends. So if you end up feeling that you don't identify as a man or woman, you're faced with the choice of losing all of your friends: all of the suicide memes and universal encouragement toward one obvious answer. 

What I'm trying to say here is that it really hurts us as a society to only accept genderqueer people who fully commit to represent the epitome of the gender they're transitioning to.",85,3,2018-09-20T06:12:51.000Z

"The one thing I don't believe in this video: you being older than a small child in 1985.

That was a great video, and in it, you managed to hit where I have stood on transitioning friends: you've got to act the role before I can begin the process of transitioning with you.  I knew a person who identified as a woman, but through the four years I knew them, never made a single effort to *present* as anything other than a guy.  In fact, if I did not know them on Facebook, I would have merely thought them gay (because they *did* openly participate in society in the role of a gay man).  I think only twice did they ever actually communicate any feminine identity to me, and that was considerably more in passing than in any other situation.  I was deeply confused by the situation: this was not a person making any effort at telling me that they were a woman other than insisting upon it once every couple of weeks.  (Compare that to other trans friends I had at the time, including one who actively transitioned while I knew him: yes, the semester where he transitioned was confusing: he started the term as a woman, using a woman's name, a woman's identity, and everything else, but by the end, he was totally a dude: I've even forgotten his deadname.  And then there was the woman who was trans *and* a fairly devout Christian: the occasional impromptu dorm room bible study with her was actually quite enjoyable and engaging, mostly because half of the people there were more interested in Christianity as a cultural force than as a lived faith.)",0,0,2018-09-20T06:04:14.000Z
In a way one gender is always defined by the other. Man read articles on what women find sexy and dress accordingly. Women do the same for men. since women are gatekeepers of procreation if anyone has power...it is them.  Because if a woman wants a kid she just has to seduce a man (which at least for a one night stand is so easy that barely qualifies as any kind of challenge) but if a man wants to have a kid he has to impress woman enough for her to decide that she wants to have a baby with him.,0,0,2018-09-20T06:03:08.000Z

If you identify as a woman but resemble a man and act masculine in every single way society recognizes as masculine and not a single person ever recognizes you as a woman, then you saying ""I'm a woman"" literally is the equivalent of you saying ""I'm a lawyer"" when you never went to law school or took the BAR. I don't think you can have it both ways. Either being a woman comes with 0 qualifications (no specific look, no specific behavioral patterns, no specific pitch of voice, etc) and is therefore a completely meaningless and arbitrary label or being a woman fits into some socially recognized set of aesthetics / behaviors that are accepted as feminine. Quite frankly I really don't know what it even means to say you're a woman but have a beard, speak in a manly voice, dress like a man, and behave in traditionally masculine ways. Like in what capacity are you a woman? Cause you claimed it? Anyone can be anything they claim by that logic and there will always be a glaring disconnect between how you identify and how every single other person in society identities you which I can't imagine is very productive.",3,5,2018-09-20T05:40:57.000Z

"While this video is definitely more reflective of the transwomen community, the conflicting ideas of ""looking the part"" and ""staying true to self"" in aesthetics is applicable to most, if not all, walks of life.  I am a cis man, and the conflict of aesthetics is something I struggle with often.  I am an introvert, and I am more comfortable by myself or with a small group of friends than I am in large groups, unless alcohol is involved.  I hate attending job fairs and networking with professionals in my field because I have to pretend something I'm not.  Even if I were a prodigy in engineering, no one would take me seriously in a job fair if I came wearing a hoodie and sweatpants instead of a clean pressed suit.  I have to take the time to work on my appearance, else I don't get a job where I want.  The networking version of me is not a reflection of my true self, but I have to act in the way others want because that's what they will respond to.

I understand that my experiences are not as dramatic as those in the trans community, and I doubt I can imagine the severity of the conflicts regarding ones experience they face.  But this video really demonstrated that conflict in a way that resonated with my own personal issues, and I find that remarkable.  Very rarely do I find YouTube content that speaks directly to my emotional conflicts.  It certainly speaks to the remarkable writing and acting Contrapoints has in her videos when a conversation about shoes that is analogous to the struggles of the trans community can be also be a metaphor of a broader issue in the human condition, cis or trans, male or female, straight or queer, or whatever.",24,1,2018-09-20T05:13:01.000Z

"This is such a deep conversation that needs to be had and it resonated a lot with me. As a non-binary trans person trying to define my own gender and balance how I want to express my gender versus how people will perceive that gender is a difficult task. I often struggle with thoughts that I'm really just a woman who's been conditioned to think that because I'm not big on traditionally feminine roles I'm non-binary and this is only exacerbated by the sheer amount of people who will look at me and only perceive me as my assigned gender.

Even as I perform the stereotypical AFAB white skinny short haired non-binary role I am still not respected and am misgendered.

I don't know where I'm going with this but this video really struck a chord with me as a young trans person only starting their transition.

The traditional femme, among whom I would probably be included, can certainly be appealing to normies who aren‚Äôt necessarily prepared to talk about the big stuff with a hardened genderqueer activist. Still, I think there is a place for a more radical, in-your-face type of approach. Feminism never got anywhere by only being acquiescent and appealing; it got somewhere by spitting in people‚Äôs faces. We know this is true fundamentally as well. We would never have collectively understood what queerness could actually look like at its peak were it not for people sacrificing their public image for it. Each approach should justify the other. Justines should exist to slowly justify the existence of Tabbies, and Tabbies should exist to make it easier and easier for Justines take more room in public consciousness, to spread the political movement as widely as possible.

"When the people I previously referred to as my family brought out the standard arguments against me, my first impulse was to bring out the standard counters. Every time I did that though, I was left wondering why. The main issue with the things they said wasn't that they were wrong, it was that they betrayed fundamental errors in thinking.

They said: I don't believe that people can show no signs and then suddenly wake up and say ""I want to be a girl"".
I said: Signs are often invisible from the outside, and may not be properly interpreted even by the subject.
The real problem: In their mind, what ""people"" did was more significant than what I was doing. I either fit some narrative or I wasn't valid.

They said: What gives you the right to just decide what you are? You haven't earned your identity.
I said: [something about the ridiculously high dose of estrogen I'm taking, administrative matters, body hair removal and so on]
The real problem: They thought identity was something that trans people had to earn, and if you weren't willing to ""put in the effort"" you weren't worth respecting.

They said: Biological sex is fixed. You can't just decide you disagree with it.
I said: Actually, intersex people exist.
The real problem: They were thinking that biological sex necessarily had anything to do with gender other than a strong statistical correlation, and that this principle was more important than actual people's lives and dignity.

Every time I gave the standard defense, I didn't actually change anything. I expanded their overly restrictive worldviews just slightly to fit myself into them, and every time I did something new I would have to do all of that over again. I was making things easier for myself in the short term, at the cost of legitimising and validating their views -- not only condemning myself to a performative relationship, but allowing them to feel better about disrespecting trans people who don't fit the mould quite as well as I do.

You can have a broad worldview and still be closed-minded. Attempting to broaden someone's mind is missing the mark -- the key is to give them a mindset where they want to broaden their own. To show them that understanding something doesn't have to be a prerequisite to respecting it. And the _only_ way to do that, is to be incomprehensible. To be civil to a reasonable extent, but have no regard for their preconceived notions. High risk, low success rate, and absolutely not worth it if you don't genuinely care about the subject (hence why I no longer refer to the above mentioned people as family), but it's the only thing that really works.",4,0,2018-09-20T04:30:20.000Z

"This was a surprisingly depressing video on the topic.
Because the thing is, I don't want to have to ""perform"" womanhood. The women I always felt most similar to were of the tomboyish variety... t-shirts and jeans, messy buns, sporty, etc. To think that they will always have that freedom to be seen and accepted as women by society regardless of what they do, where I'll always have to walk this thin line of being afraid that acting too stereotypically-guyish means that my entire womanhood can be invalidated... that is completely not fair. The only external displays of womanhood that I've really ever cared about dysphoria-wise are the physical-body-related ones and the societal-treatment ones. And that's unfortunately irreparable because, well, the puberty that I went through when I was 14 years old is over, and thus I can't go back and make my body cisnormative.

There are lots of us like this. And this exact dance between either having to perform femininity for society to make our body appear more conforming to their narrow gender norms, or just being ourselves and acting like we would have been acting had we been cis women but opening ourselves up to invalidation in the process... that is depressing. Damned if you do, damned if you don't... and all because of something we can't change which we never wanted to go through in the first place and which we've suffered tremendous anguish over not being able to correct.

I'm siding center-left toward Tabby's side. Surely something is fundamentally wrong and needs to change in a society where people are forced to do this, and where certain subsets of the community will NEVER have their voices taken seriously.

"Ok but concept: Gender is a social construct. Social constructs are made by people, and they gradually shift with the actions of people. We are people, so really we can make or break any construct we want and that's how culture evolves

Plus, having gender being only a performance of an already existing construct and archetype? That's really hard on nonbinary people, who often don't have a cultural image of what they look like and how they act. Or they relate to an archetype that isn't considered a normal gender. The archetype of Ideal Man and Ideal Woman are just as non-existant and mythological as, say, the archetype of an elf ‚Äî which people were identifying as their gender back in those pre internet ages when LOTR hit the stage

Plus, if a person has a gender and there's no one around to perform it to or convince, does it still exist? Does it and all the feelings and perspectives go away? For most nb people I know, it doesn't. 

Gender is less a performance, and more a way of relating to the world, a place you feel you occupy in the big tangled web of reality and ideas that make up culture. 

Like the metaphorical little imperfections that turn a clear, uniform, homogeneous rock into a colored gem, gender is just a thing that colors us. Like a gemstone absorbs and reflects light, gender, and identity in general really, is how you absorb and reflect the world, and ideas, and things in general

And even though some people can't see certain colors, or any colors at all, and we can't see beyond our little range, those wavelengths are still things that do stuff, even when not being perceived by a passer-by",0,6,2018-09-20T04:12:31.000Z

"I wish Blaire and Contra had a debate if Blaire's arguments are ""so bad"". I find some of Contra's opinions and arguments to suck and I find some of Blaire's to suck but both of them have made good points in the past.
I really don't understand the hatred from trans people towards Blaire, isn't she actually someone you would want other people to act like towards you and perceive you as? As the gender you psychologically feel like but still acknowledge your biological sex and make-up of your biology, so perhaps when you go to the doctor and he treats your illness with hormones, he doesn't completely fuck you up? Because frankly speaking, outside of the doctor's office and olympics or sports biological sex doesn't matter? And if you think it doesn't matter there, well.. natural selection will take care of you and just look at the results of boxing matches trans-women had against biological ones. Cause we are still animals, with different biology, with different muscle structure and muscle growth.
As an outside onlooker on this whole trans vs. cis people bullshit that has been going on in the world, all I have to offer is maybe a word of advice, as I never really held ill opinions of trans people until the SJW wave happened and still don't hold ill opinions towards their change rather than some of the member's behavior/opinions.
It's not about aestethics, I have seen ""less feminine"" looking trans-women than Blaire make good points against real women and I was always sold on what was said rather who said it. Don't just dismiss someone's disagreement with you because ""oh they disagree because I look less pretty than Blaire, nothing wrong with my logic here"", be rational be objective.. look at why people disagree with you, don't get triggered immediately and dismiss someone's criticism of you as trans-phobia. I know there exists people like that, but you can still objectively look at their reasoning and dismiss it if it really is stupid.
But if you are a trans person fighting people who are not really problematic, and fighting problems that aren't really problems, making up drama off small stupid bullshit, eventually you lose credibility, and not just yours but your whole group's. You have to realize that if you are going to stir the water at first people are watching, and if you just stir the water over and over for stupid bullshit reasons people will stop caring and get aggrevated just like the firefighters/ambulance/police if you call them over for false alarms.
Use your brains, use objectivity, use rationality and don't dismiss science, biology, psychology etc as trans-phobic and people will agree with you. Majority of the western world is not ignorant so don't fight THEM, fight those who are still ignorant, show us the difference between life in the west and in the middle-east, show us the countless ignorant attrocities done by religious groups, don't discredit them by saying discriminatory murders are at the same level of transphobia as misgendering or not being attracted to trans people. Show us, the non-ignorant people that we are not enemies, that you want our help (and you need it to change opinions of other cultures as western culture is the most influential in the world) so we can fight for your human right together.",0,0,2018-09-20T03:59:36.000Z

"Honestly i feel like the way we should handle this very very fine dichotomy is to know who your audience is. When your audience is well-versed in trans issues, tabby's perspective of speaking up with radical ideas that are just fighting for freedom from how gender exists currently would actually work. However, around the ordinary, raised-transphobic person, it makes more sense to start with keeping them comfortable and slowly edge them into being more comfortable with trans people and the most basic and simplistic trans issues. Without aesthetic, it's difficult to even break through the smallest bit to the average transphobe, and usually causes them to have an even worse view of trans people. Theres nothing wrong with knowing your audience, if there is an audience you want to reach, and using aesthetic to keep them from pulling away.",5,0,2018-09-20T03:48:09.000Z

"She's right, though. When that professor in Berkeley was caught on video attacking somebody with a bicycle lock, it was bad Aesthetics and got a lot of people talking about antifa in a negative light.

 David Duke is successful because he focuses on aesthetics, avoiding the more brazen  rhetoric and visuals of neo-nazis or the KKK that he was once a member of. The first day of Charlottesville was looking like a success for the alt-right because of the aesthetic involved with so many counter-protesters throwing things and appearing to instigate violence in the videos that were coming out of the event. It only changed because somebody driving a car into a crowd looks very bad.  

The original Nazis understood the importance of Aesthetics & pioneered propaganda, using marches and the emerging field of cinematics to great effect. American propaganda understands this and is always designed with appearances in mind.

Even this very Channel makes great use of aesthetic swith the different characters and sets and highly stylized delivery- all of which have played a role in the appeal of this channel add Natalie's ability to reach such a wide audience of people who would not tune in to hear the same points argued by somebody sitting down at a desk in front of a white wall in speaking in a monotone voice.

Donald Trump was not elected because people rally behind any real philosophy or ideology or comprehensive and coherent political platform. It was because he and the people around him nurtured and aesthetic of a political outsider, trusting that people would not question how somebody who has been greasing the palms of politicians for decades could be an outsider. Just look at the fan made propaganda that came out of the subreddits and 4chan forums that his supporters tend to frequent. Riding on a tank, carrying an eagle, and far more fit than he is in real life- it's all aesthetics.

 The leadership of a political party, the intellectuals, and a small minority of people in any large social or political movement really have a deep understanding of the issues and care about the underlying philosophical subject matter. The rest care about aesthetics and the benefits that are promised to them- and if you are promising that what you Advocate will benefit them, then you are arguably nourishing and aesthetic or affect as somebody who cares about them. If you go find the videos on YouTube of people saying that Obama was going to pay for their rent or the people who said that Donald Trump was going to bring back jobs that have been rendered obsolete by technology, you can see this for yourself.  Granted, those examples are arguably somewhat extreme, but it gets the point across.

What Tabby doesn't understand is that while we recognize her as the lady with the bat, it's not because of the underlying philosophical justifications that she might put forth for the smashy smashy. It is because of her aesthetic as a bad wielding Anarchist cat girl- anesthetic that blends the bomb-throwing anarchist archetype with the fetishized neko girl. If any other person or character or to attempt to clearly and academically lay out the rationale while wearing a simple pair of slacks and a blazer and sitting at a desk, few people would listen. There was a reason that answer for adopts the black Bloc tactic, and it's not just to conceal their identity.  They nurture a certain aesthetic.",2,0,2018-09-20T03:47:15.000Z

I can see both sides of that debate, but I think that the way you phrased it drifted slightly in a ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" direction. I agree that people can generally choose to present themselves in a certain way, but I'm not sure every trans person has the capacity to adopt a given aesthetic. Some people may choose to live one way out of necessity, not just because they want to express themselves as a nonconformist. Mind you, I'm saying this as a cis man, so I'm not living these issues, but I can see how your message might fall a little flat for people who want to look a certain way, but can't because of the circumstances they find themselves trapped in.

"There's a lot of support here which is really cool to see. The 80's aesthetic is really awesome imo and I liked the imagery you invoked when you used glittered up battle paws to change the dials on the tv. I believe that people should be able to to live as they see fit and that you should in this modern society change your sympathies and expectations of behaviour often because everything is changing at a rapid pace, in the 80s openly gay were a neglected and unwanted minority now they are more accepted and can marry. 

Technology changes every decade, just 80 years ago we were in our living spaces listening to the nightly news on developments of the situation in Europe, now we carry everyone we know with us day to day in our pocket and can listen at will to the thoughts of people we want to listen to. 

So I'll close this train of thought on the idea that I'm one of the people that enjoy listening to what you have to say contrapoints. I don't know if referring to 80s technology is a reference to how different society was only 40 years ago but it's an apt one to make if that was the case. The interesting thing is with all the emergent technology it becomes easier to control us in some sense (NSA social media showing trump news because an algorithm decides that's what gets them ad revenue, echo chambers) but it also is a place where you can be exposed to ideas and opinions you would never have entertained if all you got was some white guy on the evening news speaking in some posh mid atlantic accent.

"I feel like both Tabby and Justine are correct simultaneously (which I think is the point of the video). Tabby is arguing about how the world SHOULD be, Justine is arguing about how the world IS. I am a Black cis intersex woman, so I experience aspects of this conflict on a few different facets. 

Many, if not most, people of color practice code-switching, the act of changing one's speech and/or behavior in order to be more palatable to a white majority. Personally, I code switch in ways that temper my expression of emotions/behaviors that are stereotypes of Black women. For example, when I'm around non-Black people I don't express my anger as readily, I try not to be ""sassy"" so I use a more subtle humor, I don't let my voice get too loud even in situations which would normally warrant it. And those are only some examples. But I am in Black-majority spaces so infrequently (I live in a majority-white city, go to a majority-white university, etc.) that I start to question whether this code-switching, which is a performance, has become so habitual that it is now a genuine part of who I am. Like, I used to be a pretty silly and expressive kid, and now I'm not. Did I just grow out of that naturally? Or did I realize that Black woman aren't supposed to be silly and expressive in order to be taken seriously, and I changed not just my behavior, but my personality itself? I would love to take Tabby's point of view and just say eff it to the majority and act however I want, but the sad reality is that when I take Justine's POV, my life is easier because the world accepts more just a bit more easily. 

On the gender side of things, I probably think about my gender expression much more than most cis women because I am intersex. For context, I was raised as a woman, I identify as a woman, I am universally perceived as a woman, and I express myself within the boundaries of acceptable femininity (i.e I'm not the girliest girl but I don't shop in the men's section either). When I was growing up, I didn't consciously think about nor control my gender expression. I just did and wore what I wanted to, and I didn't think about it any deeper than that. But as I became more away of my intersex condition in my teen years, I began to question why I felt like a woman at all. After all, there are parts of my body that are not typically female, so that's not why. So is it because I was raised as a woman? Would I still identify as a woman if my parents had decided to raise me as a man? I mean, I intellectually understand that sex and gender are not the same and that they don't necessarily correlate (and obviously many cis non-intersex people understand and accept this too), but it's a whole other thing to have to deal with that difference on a personal, identity level. I even experience a mild form of gender dysphoria (I think. I'm using this term because I can't think of another one, but I don't want to misappropriate it so if there's another term for what I'm about to explain someone please tell me.) I really, really don't like the parts of my body that aren't female. They make me feel like less of a woman, even though I know that my sex has no bearing on my womanhood. I've even considered surgery. I'm trying to be all Intersex and Proud, but sometimes it's difficult, and I just want to be normal.

"Excellent video as always. The thing I can‚Äôt seem to reconcile is this idea that gender expression is a blank slate drawn in by culture . While I‚Äôm by no means an intellectual, it would seem that biology plays a rather large role in behaviors and gender expression. Take children‚Äôs preferences for violent stories being favored for young boys as an example (I apologize having no study to cite atm). I wouldn‚Äôt think that animals develop a sense of gender via this proposed ‚Äúblank slate‚Äù like bower bird nest building. That to me seems to some extent instinctual. I feel like this whole gender debate has countless variables within it that make the definitions so hard to honestly define. Is hypergamy cultural or biological? Is this significant to gender expression? I can‚Äôt believe that gender alone is a social construct, but I‚Äôd be equally dishonest to say it‚Äôs completely biological either.  Take the fact that trans people have variations in brain biology from non trans people of their biological sex, and maybe in that sense they are biologically their desired gender. Both left and right approaches frustrate me, as the right flat out deny any sort of flexibility in gender as the result of culture, while the left claims it‚Äôs completely defined by culture and not biology. It has to fall somewhere in the middle, which while extremely difficult to grasp, may make everyone actually reach a consensus on this issue.",0,0,2018-09-20T03:27:47.000Z

"certainly for the present age, which prefers the sign to the thing signified, the copy to the original, representation to reality, the appearance to the essence... illusion only is sacred, truth profane. Nay, sacredness is held to be enhanced in proportion as truth decreases and illusion increases, so that the highest degree of illusion comes to be the highest degree of sacredness. 

The celebrity, the spectacular representation of a living human being, embodies this banality by embodying the image of a possible role. Being a star means specializing in the seemingly lived; the star is the object of identification with the shallow seeming life that has to compensate for the fragmented productive specializations which are actually lived. False choice in spectacular abundance, a choice which lies in the juxtaposition of competing and complimentary spectacles and also in the juxtaposition of roles which are at once exclusive and overlapping, develops into a struggle of vaporous qualities meant to stimulate loyalty to quantitative triviality.

"I cannot speak for women. I mean, I can try but it's gonna have obvious inaccuracies.
But I can relate to some of what was said. As a gay man who's (like many others) had to juggle many circles including the extra gay clubbing scene, the stuck up ""locker room type"" boys who'll endlessly talk about vagina but if you mention penis they threaten your safety, and the many variations of how people expect gay men to be around them, I've definitely had to perform a lot and to learn what the most functional and adaptable me was, and then become that me. It's a daily exercise that I only ever get better at. But I always feel frustration. Frustration that anyone's expecting me to be something that's not accurately me. Frustration that I'm bending to them like a good little slut (which I am). Frustration that I don't really know what's the next thing I'll have to learn to be ""proper"" gay. 
Now, it's not all ugly and bad. I've learned to enjoy most of it, most of the learning. To become interested in what people think gay men are like. To have open arms when the next big trend of drag queens and gay performance will knock at my door. 
But the frustration always comes back here and there, for major and minor details. And I definitely agree with the Cat girl, and I would love to smash the people who expect a lot out of me for ridiculous reasons. But I don't hate Natalie as depicted in this video. I'm not completely lost as to why she says what she says. And she's still right that I'm gonna end up performing my identity in conform ways, way more that I'd have expected in my college activist years. And I'm at peace with some of it, just like I had to learn to be at peace with saving money and doing sad sad work. And making plans that had to do with anything other than my own expectations, that was always a nightmare. Now, it's just the way to fit in society. I keep in mind that someone out there has ideas as valid as me and that disagreeing with them won't make me have the life I expect. We'll have to meet somewhere in the middle and understand that we can't just hate each other's expectations. We all have expectations, and we all end up performing accordingly. It's kind of a form of respect, really. It's messed up from a philosophical standpoint, but it works in real life and it feels really good to not fight itall your life.

"I remember watching the episode of Elementary where Ms Hudson first showed up, I immediately loved her because she was tall and big and statuesque and gorgeous. Then of course the show felt the need to point out that she wasn't cis and I was really annoyed, because I wouldn't have noticed otherwise. Trying to train our brains not to notice gender appearance so much and just go by names and pronouns is hard enough without media not giving trans folks a chance at passing.

No wonder old school feminists clash so often with trans activism, where we see the performative aspect of femininity as oppressive and cruel since we've so long had no choice but to be pretty, demure and glamourous - trans women see it either as liberating, an expression of their inner self, or a survival mechanism.
I'm one of those cis women 'going off the grid' and I get along fine. Other women appreciate a girl who can use a hammer and drill when they can't, or someone who sees the value in both male and female-coded work. I feel like trans women aren't given so much leeway, which really sucks.",0,0,2018-09-20T03:17:35.000Z

"Interesting take, but I don't think it fully captures everything. 

I am a trans-girl, I honestly don't over think how I express myself; things are things, and stuff is stuff.. I am doing this to be happy w/ myself; I can see where Justine gets ""fake it until make it"" from, I guess... it really wasn't my experience.. better to say, explore who you are. I was just me... and channeled that, and I do what ever that is. I can be really femme, or really tomboy, or so I am told. Anyways, about the performance of gender, I think you really need to talk about sexual dimorphism. For work, I have to wear coveralls (boy ones, because it's next to impossible to find girl ones (kinda clear what that is saying), the smallest boys size make me look like I am a kid drowning in adult clothes), rubber boots, and my hair is up, covered by a super cool Tilley Hat, and zero makeup on; so as for my clothes.. I am literally dressed ""as a boy"", and the act which I am doing.. well it's a job, but one that had been stereotypically boy work; I have never been misgendered, or even seen as less of a girl, I tend to get praised more for it. The so called performance doesn't really matter in this case; I am basically Mulan, in boy-mode, and people are like, ""ya, you cannot fool us, you're a girl"". Why? Well... my characteristics are phenotypically female (it's not like they can even see I have have breasts), and apparently I am pretty. It's why some trans-girls have to compensate with gender stuff, to make up for their characteristics to be (more) accepted as a girl. So yes, aesthetics matter; both sex characteristics and gender characteristics.

I look female, sound female, generally act in what ever way someone would seem a range of being a girl ... but, that only means I am accepted as a cis-girl , not as a trans-girl. I rarely meet someone that actually fully accepts me as a valid type of girl if they know I am trans, despite everything (politeness isn't the same thing, I find that more so). Most of my interactions feel really superficial because of this; I have zero idea unless I out myself over-and-over if someone might actually accept me (and it's really stressful.. like mini first coming out episodes). Does it help stealth-passing? Obviously yes. I can go to the store easily, and washrooms are less scary now. But, I am rejected most of time, and I hardly have anyone in my life. Being an uber girl didn't keep my parents from disowning me (calling me an it, a medical Frankenstein, a sin against god, etc), many of my other family member don't accept me... I basically don't have a home to go back to, and many of my ""friends"" left me. If I meet a potential romantic partner, I go from being ""the most beautiful girl"" to a freak; it turns into an interview really fast... they basically stop talking to me right after. They are always ""taken off guard"", and get super weird. I am terrified by any casual interaction, especially at a club.. because I am basically seen as tricking people: either I am worried about a guy physically assaulting me, or another girl accusing me of being some sort of predator. I live in small city, and personal safety is an issue... I already have enough bad experiences as a perceived cis-girl (unwanted touching, followed home, followed and blocked from getting into my car while they attempted to grope me..) that I am already kinda always freaked out now. The worst is seeing how things could be, like.. if I was just like any other girl... and losing it over-and-over.  Anyways, what I am trying to say.. I am always trans, doesn't matter how pretty I am, or how well I can pass... life isn't suddenly magical, it can make a whole different set of problems. Maybe not for others, they have better RNG. At the end of the day, what I get.. and makes it all worth it is be myself; and it's worth isn't merely reflected back to me by others... it's how I see myself naked and alone.",41,7,2018-09-20T02:43:37.000Z

"This was a cool video. I was disturbed by Justine's argument: to say that gender is just aesthetic and just how people look at you is like asking if a tree falls in a forest does it make a sound. I'm a woman when I'm sleeping and when I'm awake. I'm a woman when I'm outside with people around and when I'm inside with absolutely no one looking at me. To say that gender disappears when no one is looking at you is also a form of robbery? I don't know what gender Is necessarily, but I've got it, and I've got it all the time. You know that intimately, I'm sure. I think what you're saying is that there's an accentuated public self versus and private self as a trans woman? coming into your own, but also having to accentuate your Own in the public eye to people who don't understand who you are or where you come from. I think I relate to this as a biracial person, I enter spaces and people's immediate response is scrutiny of my race, who I am, where I come from those kinds of things, instead of Me. Anyway.

"I'm a cisgendered female and watching this all I could think of was ""Well, based on this debate, I'm not a woman."" At the end of the day I am not feminine. Not like Blaire White is, for example. I don't wear make-up, I don't wear heels, I know how to chop wood without holding the axe screaming like a retard, acting like I'm helpless (unlike how Blaire acted in one of her videos doing ""guy stuff""). 

My interests are what people would consider to be ""male interests"", from surfing, to skateboarding, to playing video games. I always saw femininity as a weakness, so my whole life I strived to be self-sufficient. My idea of self sufficiency was denying everything that could be perceived as feminine because I wanted to be strong. I dreaded the idea of being seen as delicate. I suffer the consequences of it today because men tend to see me as one of the boys rather than a woman, and I never wanted that. All I wanted was to be seen as someone who was strong and self-sufficient and now I can't act feminine even if I try to. I just feel awkward doing it. When I put makeup on, wear heels and a dress, I just feel like I'm wearing a costume. 

I am sensitive and delicate deep down, which are traits I associated with femininity, but I externally I forced myself to have all these masculine traits just so I would be respected by other people and they wouldn't see that I was sensitive, delicate and might need help occasionally. I really don't know why, but in puberty, I started seeing femininity as a weakness, so I just denied it. I didn't want to be grouped with people who cried when they got physically hurt, cried when someone was mean to them and didn't know how to do anything without asking for help, who chose to sabotage others behind their backs over face to face, physical confrontation. I didn't want to be seen like that and I didn't want to be that person.

My sister, on the other hand, is very feminine. She would just mimic her idols when we were kids and 15 years later, she is 30 years old and still talks like Britney Spears. Everything she does are things she's learned. The way she moves, the way she talks, the way she touches her hair... she learned it! She observed it. It started when she was very young and she literally acted the part until she now is that person she strived to become: a very feminine woman. But she picked this up from other people. We were brought up by a single dad in the same environment, went through the exact same pressures, but I came out denying femininity and she came out overly feminine. Where am I trying to get with this? I don't really know. But I feel like I'm at war with who I am constantly because I see femininity as a weakness and at the same time I secretly love getting French nails done and the smell of Chanel No. 5 on my skin hahaha fuck my life. Anyway, I guess the moral of the story is no matter how you are presenting yourself you are mimicking an idea of it. Being a woman means either going with the flow or going against it. Most trans women put in the effort of being a woman I was meant to put in from an early age but never wanted to make because I thought it made me weak. Most trans women are better at being a woman than I am, whatever that means.",84,29,2018-09-20T02:27:19.000Z

"I am not trans, and although I am not going to say that my personal experience is equivalent to the situation expressed in this video, I can say that this really resonated with me.

I have always hated my looks, I have always been a tom boy, and I have always worked in male-led industries. For 25 years I didn't know how to really apply make up, I never style my hair, never wear anything other than work clothes, and act like a greasy line cook. I am not feminine. 

But there is power in being feminine. When I do dress like a woman, EVERYONE changes how they treat me. They talk about how, ""I clean up nice"" and hold eye contact with me longer. They smile more, and people listen better.

I have always looked up to characters like Daria from MTV. I always wanted combat boots, crazy colored hair, and baggy ass Tripp pants with chains. I always wanted to be unabashedly me. But I find myself constantly hating feminine women for having society's love, approval, and attention. Hating them for making the effort to make themselves seen by society, and thus having power within it.

It is petty. It is childish. I want to dress like a sloppy poor dude and still be seen as beautifully feminine. But that isnt how it works. I am glad to be me, but I see the trade off in personal comfort vs social standing. 

I feel like this video wasnt meant for cis girls like me. But it really resonates with me. Thanks for this,   Nat. I don't know exactly how this video makes me feel. And I kinda like that <3",1484,65,2018-09-20T02:06:33.000Z

"This felt like such an intellectually honest video. The dialogue format and the fact that you let arguments go to their logical endpoints without resorting to politically motivated distortions work really nicely. Finding arguments politically repulsive is no excuse not to give them any thought - our job as progressives is not necessarily to deny the factfulness of opposing talking points but to give them our own spin/narrative and disarm our opponents by showing that the facts don't really show what they think they show.

I know it wasn't the main thrust of this video but I found the stuff about the nature of gender interesting. I've never really found Butler's performativity theory convincing. It comes with a kind of a superficiality that I don't like and I think Tabby is right to point it out.

Gender seems to me to be contingent but not arbitrary. That is, there's some kind of inner determination (or ""inner truth"" like Tabby would say) involved but ultimately it's impossible to ""prove"" to be this or that gender. Marks of sex/gender, like behavioral traits, genitals or even chromosomes, only function as long as we don't interrogate them. Ben Shapiro can point to people's chromosomes as long as he wants but it's simply impossible for him to explain how having XY chrosomes makes him a ""man"". Why are these ""male chromosomes""?

Aaanyway, I hope there's a lot more to come. Your videos about trans issues are probably your best ones (no surprise there!). Even for me and I'm cis. The fact that you're passionate about these topics and struggle to make sense of them really shows - and transforms into quality content.",1,0,2018-09-20T02:04:49.000Z

You perform a cost-benefit analysis, you play out what might happen, and you push the envelope in subtle ways, hoping to ease into the 'role'. You want it to look natural, you want acceptance, but what you want isn't what you get. My trite semi-coherent babble aside, words matter, but actions matter even more.

"One of the realizations of living in a communal reality is that other members of reality can, to some extent, modify the reality as it relates to them.  If someone views you as crazy, then to that locality you *are* crazy.  If someone views you as a woman, a man, or otherwise, then they have enforced that reality in their locality.  When a larger group within communal reality does this, they have a larger effect by virtue of making up a larger part of that communal reality.  Likewise, if someone has a lot of social capital, whether that's the personal-to-you capital of a confidante or the communal capital of a public figure, then in their place of power do they also have great effect.

However, you must also recognize your own ability to have an effect on communal reality, and that your effect within your locality is also greater.  Rebuking those who have a toxic effect on the communal reality is its own kind of power.",77,0,2018-09-20T01:28:07.000Z

"Ben Shapiro is wrong about the genetics. TransG generally has neurological differences from the cisG brain which matches with the individuals gender identity and not their birth gender which means it‚Äôs probably genetic.

"Ok, I'm going to be the a-hole and everyone is going to yell at me probably. For me, my gender as a woman comes from being raised as a woman and all of the expectations and experiences that come with that. Now I know that a lot of people will say I am a TERF for saying that but that is honestly how I identify with my gender if I am really honest about it. I accept that trans women are women and I don't buy the asthetic argument because as Tabby said, non-conforming cis women are still women. What the hell makes someone a woman then? I seriously don't understand what the reasoning is. If it's not experiences then what the hell is it? If you say, for example, that is is a way of thinking then that is also sexist because what the hell is a ""male"" or ""female"" way of thinking? I mean most of my interests are ""typically"" ""male"" and that comes with a lot of limitations. While Nat was studying philosophy at uni and passing as male I was being laughed out of my politics class because as a woman I couldn't possible understand politics and as a woman, I am rarely taken seriously in philosophical debates. My partner (a cis man) is the one in academia while I stay at home with the baby and I have to deal with his intelligencia friends assuming that I am supid because I work in childcare (a job I took to support his career in a tough job market) I have seriously never gotten a straight answer about why people who are not raised as a gender identify as that gender. Normally people just say something like ""Oh I really liked makeup and dresses growing up""  It's not my intention to offend anyone I just want an explanation that makes sense.",6,8,2018-09-20T01:20:33.000Z

"i'm a cis woman with no idea what gender is since i identify as a woman on purely aesthetic terms but believe aesthetic is the only way to contribute the universe with what i have, so am i presenting a truth within me? are these my beliefs? am i following the path of least resistance?
i like my boobs bc theyre big and look sexy to others but would i be comfortable with them being small? would that change the way i walk, sit, dress? the way i choose to show myself and my gender since i only wear mans clothes when im at home not being watched and when i am being watched like in a selfie or whatever i try to accentuate my waist and my collarbones and neck.
i've always liked butler bc it makes sense to me, to me it really is about performing, even performing for myself at times, this winter i was single and wore long sleeves all season yet i still shaved my armpits bc i like the touch of soft skin, the femenine touch of soft skin - and i know there are men with soft skin but i guess my mind just cancels those out when thinking of gender, because also to me, its really not about individuals, im heavily influenced by radfems and believe in patriarchy bc thats how opression works but its foolish to pretend the individual doesnt matter, and knowing gender is a social construction to facilitate social roles i kind of think gender doesnt even exist but thats obviously not the case for many trans people i know, im so lost oh my god what am i even saying, what do i know??, should i know??

"At the start of the video I felt I couldn't really relate as a cis male. However, after listening to the internal monologue for a bit, it sounded really similar to the stuff I think about male masculinity. The dialogue actually took me back to some dark teen times and my first relationships. I'm currently still a twig boy in university still struggling on the how and why I should be ""masculine"". But this video, although I think targeted towards a trans audience, really gave me insight on what it means to be a man.

"What I like about these discusion videos is how I can empathize and agree to a certain extent with both characters. In Justine's case I think she is correct when it comes to being a cis-facing trans activist. (This is just a term that I made up, so I would define it as being an activist that is attempting to improve the Cis perspective on Trans people.) In this circumstance Justine is right, if you are making or participating in media who's primary audience is for Cis people then passing and being civil is extremely important. When fighting for the most basic rights of trans individuals it will be easier to pass favorable bills when the public perception of trans people is them being the pinnacle of masculinity or femininity. Now this will lead to poor stereotypes of trans people, one that will take a while to stamp out and bring the perception of trans individuals back to a more reasonable center. That being I think getting basic legal protection for trans individuals and changing the perspective away from the idea that people who are trans are simply pretending to be their gender is more important then the negative repercussions that will come from Justine's perspective. Tabby's perspective on the other hand is more important when looking at trans focused trans activists. (By this I mean activists are focused on making trans individuals and people who are experimenting with gender identity feel more comfortable and understood.) When looking at these activists Tabby is absolutely correct. Justine is presenting an unhealthy and untenable presentation of femininity, one that most people who are transitioning or are looking to transition will not be able to meet, at least not for a very long time. For these people its important to tell them that there isn't a right and wrong way to be trans, and they can express their gender how they see fit. A balance of activists like Justine and Tabby are needed in order to build a holistic and functioning trans community. (Wow that was longer then I intended, I am cis btw and this was just my perspective and my take away from Natalie's video. If you disagree with me please respond to this to let me know, I really appreciate feedback and different perspectives.)",0,0,2018-09-20T01:08:07.000Z

If you want to be treated like the gender you feel you are, you will have to make some effort to portray yourself that way, but ultimately your gender identity can never be ""erased"".

"To me I think this video perfectly highlights that often the problem within conversations about gender identity is that it ignores how the category of gender itself is the problem. The idea of performativity laid out by Judith Butler (who later when talking about how TERFs used that to bash Trans women said that ""one should feel free to explore the course of our gender identity"") only gets us so far as how we can live our best lives in response to gender being put upon peoples bodies. We live within the confines of what gender is, but we need an insurrection against the very limits of its existence. Judith Butlers original point in creating ""Gender Trouble"" was to outline how the idea that there is a ""Female"" subject at the heart of feminism is the problem, because the ""Feminine"" subject is always being reconstructued. There is no template to which one ""attempts"" to mimic femininity (which is the point being made when Tabby asks where do you get your ideas of gender from"". What ""Femininity"" is is determined by its juxtaposition to Masculine norms. Thus the very idea of ""gender"" itself as a category that limits the characteristics of ones existence I believe is the problem.

"I found this video really powerful Justine. As a cis woman I obviously cannot relate to having the validity of my gender identity scrutinized on a daily basis, but in seeing the struggles of trans men and women close to me, and in my own experience as a woman with autism, the dichotomy of optics/aesthetic vs unchecked inner expression hit home. The philosophical question of whether the identity we perform for society is reality; or whether the identity of our personal ""truth"" is reality; is something I struggle with.
I don't intend to remove trans women from the topic of this discussion,  but I've realized that trans women and autistic women have similar experiences with that dichotomy of self-expression. There is also a disproportionate percentage of transgender and non-binary people within the autistic population so it wouldn't be too farfetched to note similarities.

Women on the spectrum can develop ""masking"" as a survival mechanism wherein they observe neurotypical behavior and alter aspects of their own ""optics"" to match. This is a very energy intensive task and in my case lead to depersonalization, dissociating, anxiety and depression. Some develop eating disorders. Experts believe masking causes women to go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as BPD or bipolar (also common in transgender people). 
Most experience extreme relief after diagnosis only to realize that gaining introspection doesn't free them from societal expectations. Masking isn't limited to women but is more common, I believe due to the limited range of how society perceives acceptable female behavior and appearance (like Tabby says). In professional and political settings (which are often one in the same) women, in general, need to do a lot more to be respected - makeup, gender-appropriate clothing, smiling and speaking delicately to not seem 'rude'. 
The social mechanism is the same for autistic women and trans women but the outcomes are different - when autistic women don't conform, we are seen as rude, untidy, incompetent; when trans women don't conform they can be seen as all those things and also get misgendered.

In the end I don't really know which way is better (changing optics to fit society vs free inner expression) but perhaps the cynical answer is changing aesthetics of how society views trans and autistic people will validate these groups in the political conversation and thus lead to a better chance of society accepting a wider range of inner expressions.",2,0,2018-09-20T00:58:02.000Z

Update + Edit: I play a lot of mobile games (mostly Japanese if you couldn't tell by my Idolish7 icon) and lot of games basically say this. The games often say that crossdressing is fine as long as you look attractive. Yeah, the characters in those games are comfortable in their biological gender but the majority always have the characters say that. I even read interviews and on YouTube where they have asked people about transgenders. That it's only fine if they look attractive. Personally, I don't like it. Because some can't dress in the opposite way. And some are comfortable in how they dress and/or body.

"This video is incredibly well done and I really love it, i'm young trans male. Pre-everything and constantly getting misgender. The idea of trying to pass is a good one, especially for me. I live in a terrible state for transgender individuals, and I see a lot of people who act like tabby aka fighting back with threats and all that does is hurt people like me. I don't dye my hair anymore, I don't act the same. The more i see people acting like mogai the more I am terrified of having to go to my school counselor saying another kid is outing me and harassing me.

But at the same time, I don't believe the clothes have a gender. I don't think that trans men should have to act super masculine and I don't think trans women should have to act super feminine but it's a society that we all live in including cis people.

"Excellent video :)¬†I just want to help clarify a¬†part where you discuss ""gender performance"". Butler¬†uses some pretty poor wording in Gender Trouble, so she's had to go out of her way to clarify what she means by this.¬†¬†To my understanding: Gender Performance is exactly what it sounds like--literally acting out a caricature of what any given individual deems to be associated with the gender.¬† This is often done in theatrical and showy ways such as through drag. GENDER PERFORMATIVITY on the other hand is what¬†Contra referred to as the 24/7 drag: it is how all human beings subconsciously act out their gender through what they say and what they think.¬† As a man, if I gravitate toward blues and blacks instead of yellows and pinks; this is not natural, but is instead¬†me acting out the gender conditioning that my society has exposed me to.¬† For trans women, their gender performativity typically aligns more closely with whatever happens to be the opposite of their bio-sex (though this is not always necessarily the case).¬† Having a GENDER EXPRESSION that doesn't match your bio sex¬†involves the acknowledgement of¬†societal gender norms and twisting them, taking what any given society deems to be related to one gender and adopting¬†them yourself¬†(ei: choosing to wear a skirt means that my gender expression is female, even if I am a straight bio-sex male who identifies as male).It's all a lot to take in, but gender is complicated, so I've tried my best to understand it to the best of my ability.¬† If anyone thinks that I said anything inaccurate, please feel free to correct me, as I'm always excited to learn more about these topics.

"Btw Natalie, I loved your critique of Butler and her whole gender performance and gender performativity framework. That whole but with Tabby and Justine was extremely interesting and I needed to hear it go down like that. I'm a critical gender studies grad from college and that's some entry level stuff that's really... Well it's part of your bread and butter when you start out those first upper divs. I liked your use of aesthetics to deconstruct that framework and propose via Tabby how identity matters too that convo and can't be so easily set aside in favor of this ""repetition without an original"" stuff that's honestly pretty dismissive of individual identity and personal experience.
Butler seems to always be very ???? in incorporating trans people and people of color into her frameworks

Obviously the point of your vid was something much more important and personal, I just wanted to say what was sticking out to me most on a first watch and why (I'm a cis queer xicana).

"as much as i absolutely love this video and resonate with tabby a bit, i think there's also something to be said about the trans people who DO try to their fullest extent to pass, rather than rejecting norms like Tabby. i'm one of those trans people who... honestly does try a lot to conform, but also wants to maintain some of my personal aesthetic and style. of course, it's a different experience for me as a trans man, as womanhood comes with a LOT more expectations and a lot more tied to it, but i still think there's a lot to be said on this topic still. also, amazing video! i think it's fitting there isn't much that's explicitly conclusive about it; the trans community still really hasn't talked about optics, because i think a lot of us don't want to admit how much influence it has on us, and just assume it's by default part of the trans experience.

"I really enjoyed this video and while I am a cis woman and do not share the same experiences as transwomen I think it is valuable to analyze gender in this way. The point that a large part of gender is what other people recognize you as along with your personal identity pulls a lot of weight. After all, part of the journey of people who decide to transition is having other people recognize you as the gender that you identify yourself as. I would imagine part of that identification comes with observing what standards our society attaches to women and men and identifying whether those standards align with your own identity. In that vein of thinking, it would be important that other people treat you like the gender that fits you best and many people have a hard time treating people as the gender they identify with unless that person conforms with society's standards of masculinity and feminity. I would personally love to see some pundit try to argue that men and women are treated exactly the same in every context and that we do not have differing standards and expectations between men and women.",0,0,2018-09-20T00:06:19.000Z

"Here's a concept.  DUMP GENDER.  OR, realize there is not one damned thing wrong with being a masculine woman or a feminine man, but most important of all there is NOTHING WRONG WITH FEMININITY!!!  The trans movement is in too many ways pressuring many that don't follow standard gender norms to identify as a gender other than themselves rather than working on doing away with these outdated and limiting gender rules.  Instead of broadening the definitions of gender, with A LOT OF OVERLAP, the movement seems content to keep people of all genders in gender boxes.  Many of the points Tabby made to me were right on the money.  We need to get away from gendering things like styles, careers, clothing.  (By the way, I am a cis, straight male, that as long as I have been alive have preferred so called feminine styles, and go out as I like when I can.  I throw people off because I identify as male even if I look like Morticia Adams, or Siousxie Sioux.  There is nothing inherently any sex about hair length, pants, skirts, leggings, COMBAT BOOTS  (:P ).  There is skant little inherently biological about how one moves...it is all socially pushed, and yes, constructed.  By the way....more power to Tabby!!!  To the issue of the murdered trans women.  Something that is being kept out of those stories where, and what they were doing at the time of their murder.  A majority of them were selling their bodies to Cis men.  The reason they were doing that was not because they like to, but because of sexist notions in the working world and places that are STILL able to indirectly practice sexism, by NOT hiring trans people.  This is why ALL gender based dress codes, and presentation codes need to DIE.  Guh, that Shapiro and Zoe bit is so beyond grating.  She did exactly what that little dweeb wanted.  She fell right into his trap.  The error and failure points I am seeing is when schools say ""Students may dress in line with their identified gender.""  Instead of flat out saying ""Students may dress however they like, as long as what they were is within length and cleanliness guidlines.  The same should happen for company dress codes.  If a man can wear something, then so should all genders working there.  If a Woman can wear an item or style, then so should all sexes that work there have that choice.",0,3,2018-09-19T23:53:12.000Z

"ily!! 

this video really helps to explore something that a lot of (lgbt) people feel but can't quite express, and its the first time ive seen this concept in a video and not in loaded literature. this is one of my fav videos of yours!! years ago i used to express my feminism by non-conformity. later i expressed my ftm feelings by presenting myself as somewhere in between, because i thought masculinity was inherently bad. 

both of these expressions were detrimental to me and my cause. i wanted to be taken seriously, i wanted people to see me as more than a stereotype or an embarrassment. i decided that if i wanted to be a man i would have to go all the way, and that if i wanted to be a woman i had to conform. this way i could change normie minds lol. i actually thought of it as... kind of an agent on the inside...
 
it's a form of oppression, to lack the freedom or safety to present as you desire, but an oppression that you can play to your advantage. 

i think a major step in Extremely Online Lgbt Theory is learning that the most effective way to change the world and live your best life is to be accepted/to pass. passing as a trans person (women esp)... even being acceptable to hetero society as a lesbian, a feminist, a radical, is seriously a tool in shifting the... social overton window? when these groups are seen as friendly... normal... it changes views. it's depressin, but it's realistic. but making trans people Look more acceptable on tv, online, eventually makes it safer for people who don't pass. its all the long game.

It reminds me of people saying black people need to improve their communities by pure individual will - pulling up pants, not joining gangs, etc. - ignoring that these problems stem from their sociopolitical situation and its history, that these problems and the narrative surrounding them have been constructed around this situation.

"This video bring up a very important duality, content x form. As the yin and yang, this duality is complementary instead of contradictory. One can not live without the other. You will not eat a cake that doesn't look/smell good, you will not approach someone with unfriendly body language, you will not notice a book without a good cover. But you also will not like a cake that looks/smells good, but tastes like crap, nor a person who seems friendly but treat you rudely, nor a book with great cover but bad story. It is easy to dismiss form as being shallow, but it is part of reality, the part that signals to the external world what might be inside. Form is not about hiding or enhancing content (although sometimes is used that way), but it is about comunicating it. I don't think we can combat the shallow uses of form (the meaningless stereotypes) by just rejecting it. We must embrace the importance of form, if we want to use it for display of real content, instead of just a facade. I, giving a simple example, don't care about clothes, but I dress fairly well, because I know other people will judge me. I don't dress exceptionally well, because that would be unauthentic with my personality. In the same way, in other instances we must find a balance between who we are and what we want to communicate with other people, taking in account that stereotypes are just inevitable. I know that things get complex when is about your gender identity, but, how complaining about things that you can't control improve your quality life? If I hate dressing well, how not dressing well improves my life? More often than not, life doesn't hold up for our standards of fairness. But I wonder if, once we, as a society, starts to understand and appreciate the importance of form related with its content, we could get rid off useless stereotypes, and hold to the more fair and humane ones.",0,0,2018-09-19T23:36:47.000Z

"The difference between our authentic utopian dreamer selves (tabby) and the political animals that live in our society (Justine). Justine compromises her values in order to be practical enough in a cruel world in order to further the very values she compromised. Its fucked up, its heroic, its tragic. 

We want to destroy the current social order, CAN we destroy it from outside it, by refusing to conform to its standards. Or MUST we subvert it from within, by ""passing"" our views within the overton window for small victories won with the consent/compromise of our opponents.  

Obviously, destroying the Patriarchy from the outside is more desirable, and if possible, should be done. Justine questions this, she claims the current cultural hegemony is so strong, that we have literally no choice but to enter the Patriarchy and compromise for what we can. 

Fine. Whatever, fuck society, fuck injustice fuck bigots and fascists, but most of all, fuck defeat, fuck futility and fuck failure. I know what the quest for justice is, I know my allies, and we must, we MUST, WE MUST enter circles that pass laws, that change views, that shift society.

"What exactly is gender then?  It's easy to conceptualize masculine (cis)women, and it's easy to understand feminine transwomen. However, it's confusing when someone claims to be a transwoman, but presents themselves in a masculine way. In that case, what does the claim of womanhood even mean? We've already disconnected genitals, chromosomes, and other biological (and latent biological) traits we are born with. Femininity and masculinity, on terms of how one acts and presents oneself, seem like the only criteria left by which we define womanhood. As sympathetic as I am to a transwoman facing with an internal crisis like this, we need concepts people can wrap their heads around.

"As a cis man... I can see the points of both Tabby and Justine. They are both right and wrong... and that's the ""problem"". It's not a ""either/or"". It's a complicated issue without a right answer. In the end... people want acceptance, even when they say they don't. Tabby says she doesn't care about what other think... but the fact she gets frustrated when misgendered shows that is not entirely true. As Justine says... are you a doctor if no one considers you one? Maybe there's a point there... a woman is broadly who society considers to be women. And as bad that sounds... it doesn't need to be. We can expand that. Tabby doesn't need to change so that she can fit into society's definition of woman... instead society's definition must expand to include Tabby.

Feminists aren't the ones killing transwomen, so why threaten them with violence? It is because you want to threaten violence on women to shut them up or else. THAT is misogyny!

Too many people are more interested in feeling self-righteous (beating TERFS with bats) than in making actual change (by sitting down and having a conversation), and in the process of doing so, set back the actual progress that more moderate individuals are making. That being said, I will disagree on one point:

I am a trans woman for no one but myself. I define my womanhood based on the hormones in my body, and the secondary sex characteristics that I am able to influence via the hormones. Now, in business settings, I put on a badass suit with heels to make myself feel powerful. In a social setting, I wear a nice dress to feel beautiful. In most other settings, I wear leggings and a t-shirt to feel comfortable. In each situation, I'm presenting for no one but myself. I would rather live in a world where I saw myself as a woman, but everyone else still saw me as a man, than a world where I had to see myself as a man, but everyone else saw me as a woman, because at the end of the day, I am the only one (relative to the cis world) that has to live with my dysphoria.",1,0,2018-09-19T23:20:02.000Z

"I rather enjoyed the music -- especially the sort of spooky bits. Good job to whoever did that.

As for the notion of aesthetic and identity... I (a straight cis fella) feel like I could ramble on about how I don't like that mindset for a long time. But to keep it short, I find the pursuit of aesthetic and using it to define who you are to be pointless -- I see how it is a rather weighty matter for a trans person. But I'm thinking back to my high school and college days when I recall a lot of people who decided that what they looked like determined who they were to a far greater degree than what they _did_ and what they _believed._ Frauds, essentially. To me, that way of thinking seems like it leads to insanity, or (to be less hyperbolic) to dissatisfaction and a feeling of emptiness. We all have different struggles, and like it or not appearance matters since those of us who are sighted rely on appearance a great deal. But I've personally always preferred sincerity of character. Just BE who you are. Whether or not you look like a woman, _be_ a woman. Right? (Geez, it's soooo easy). The appearance will matter, but I find it matters less so than Who You Are At Your Core. And though I may be ridiculously wrong here, I suspect that transitioning isn't just about looking like a woman -- otherwise a person could simply stick with drag and perfect that illusion -- but feeling like one for your own peace of mind, so that even when you don't put in the work to dress up you still _know_ you're female despite lounging around in pajamas with messy hair and bingeing Netflix on the couch.

I really hope I didn't come off as patronizing, because that wasn't my intention at all.

Of course I also think that the clothes we were are irrelevant. Suits... how bizarre is it that suits are accepted to confer some notion of status? Or that a straw hat seems to detract it? It's all so completely arbitrary. If the entirety of the human race woke up tomorrow with complete amnesia about our cultures and wardrobes and everything else with no clues to remind us... what would that world look like a week later, or a year later?",0,0,2018-09-19T23:15:01.000Z

If we demanded every Black person have to prove themselves individually worthy of respect instead of passing legislation or advocation block social reform odds are there'd still be segregation and apartheid.

"Hmmm... This reminds me of Matt Baume's video ""Why ""Straight Acting"" Insults the Memory of Stonewall."" It's more about men conforming to stereotypical manly men stuff, rather than women conforming to stereotypical womanly woman stuff - but I think the two videos work well in conversation, and have interesting things to say to each other.

"This reminds me of the fault I find with many of Judith Butler's followers as well. They read Butler, but do not read Kojeve, Husserl, and Hegel. Identity itself (not just of gender) can be understood only through the performative ritual. While there is almost certainly a precondition that makes one a woman, trans or otherwise, we only discover what this means through action, reaction, and recognition. We experience reality phenomenologically, not objectively. We do not experience reality, ours or that of others, directly but through a variety of filters and an illogically ordered sequence.",4,0,2018-09-19T22:33:06.000Z

"Hey, someone who knows more about judith butler, please answer.
I have been reading recently the gender trouble, and other main idea i love, apart from the performative idea of gender, is the idea of not defining what womanhood is at all, at least not completely. This effectively denounces the idea of a metaphysical understanding of the feminist struggle, and reduces it all to politics. It would be saying that essence of metaphysical substance doesnt precede political action and society, but viceversa.
This effectively puts Catgirl (lol) in a dilemma, because what is her identity that she claims to be anyways? But many would see a problem, because of the psychological involvement with being transgender. So, for the purpose of the argument, lets grant there is a psychological cause for transgenderism, or even rooted in biology. How would we ever know if, even granting the psychology, that the way everyone rationalises this phenomena isnt rooted in social customs? If, for example, transgenderism at its core is a discomfort with parts of your body, how would we know if the vocabulary we use to describe it (being a woman) is culturally caused? My point is, we cannot really step out of our culture and get a gods-eye view of everything (what would that even be).
So it seems that trans people are in a great dilemma, but only after we hear one of Justines arguments that we see the light: that if we grant validity to the performing type of gender, a cis woman has as much of a ¬´woman¬ª as a trans woman. And here is where abigail is incorrect, in my opinion, because she is effectively using an essentialist rhetoric of what womanhood is to shut down other experiences, being this essentialism what makes her as bad as the average cis straight guy. I repeat, we cannot step outside our culture, so maybe not having a defined womanhood is good.

Id like to illustrate what im saying better with nonbinary folks. The thing is, we could argue that nonbinary isnt really real because it is socially constructed, an illusion. This stems from nonbinary being a direct negation of the binary, which is also socially constructed. But then, wouldnt nonbinary people be as real as the binary? 
The problem here is putting essence before politics, because thats how people actually become closeminded and stop hearing other peoples experiences: when they have an excuse not to do it, which is ¬´reality¬ª. But this reality is the real illusion here, and when we drop it, we actually can see all the struggle, we are much more willing to listen. We could actually use multiple definitions of gender, or use new vocabulary, without contradiction. We can grant validity to imposed and oppresive gender roles while supporting the trans cause, because they have so much shit to deal with. Its a paradox, really: because when you are so deep in an ideology, you completely miss other forms of oppression and suffering.
It is here where i think that the antiessentialist, postmodern, view of gender and reality is useful, and where butler truly shines. In the end, pragmatism is really what i think we should strive for, not because feelings should be glorified, but because we effectively downplay what are called ¬´facts.¬ª

So, contra, i love you and your channel, and i am fully aware that the point of the video was to reflect the struggle to ¬´pass¬ª as your gender, i just heard and saw you use butler as a weapon against trans people. So, if you implied that butlers theory is inherently anti-trans, i fundamentally disagree.

Sorry about the rant. If you cared enough to read until here, please try to raise some points, because i have no way of knowing if what i just wrote is gibberish lol. I am just concerned about everyones well being, and just want a conversation.",7,1,2018-09-19T22:32:21.000Z

Like bikers were sold a line of how someone who owns a Harley should look and act, and that's a pure choice that applies to men and women that fall into it and is ... mostly racially ambiguous. Hell as a comic nerd there's some of this idea of Aestetic that can be a hurdle to overcome. I say this not to detract from anything in the video, but to point to how heightened it is when you're talking about sexuality and a base identity.

"This might be a bit unrelated but I have a question I've been really struggling with lately -- ever since I started learning more about feminism, I've always read and been told that gender is a social construct -- but when you take trans people into account, doesn't that automatically disprove the social construct idea? + doesn't it reinforce that there are only two genders? I read a few posts and discussions about how kids are being pushed into one of two boxes from a young ago and that's the reason people can feel dysphoria, because they're pushed into the wrong box, and the solution would be to abolish those boxes in the first place. And for me that made a lot of sense, but then I was told that those opinions came from TERFs?? And now I just don't know what the right way to think is...

"Doubt anyone will read this comment but here goes: 

Ok, this all makes sense to me, EXCEPT for the part about MEN being in power. I mean, let us assume that society is not patriarchal in function for just a moment. To me, a man, manhood seems to get revoked at just about the same rate and at the same rate that womanhood does. A lot of small men have to deal with performing masculinity all their lives due to their height being seen as unmasculine. Skinny men have to prove it due to their lack of physical aptitude. Fat men, bald men, men without facial hair, men with gyno or physically disabled men. Even men that perform masculinity to its peak might have their ""manhood"" revoked because they are not straight, or because they like shaving their legs or because they use a lot of skincare products. And this revoking of manhood is often not introduced by other men. Women revoke manhood just as much as men might revoke womanhood because a woman is not ""fuckable"" or ""womanly"". Isn't the whole ""men decide what's true"" argument kind of... void in practice? Because as much as I agree with the general explanation and idea of ""aesthetics"" here, I can't see the argument that men the cause of the aesthetical dilemma as true in the context of your blonde character's argument.

There is a difference between how our brains perceive colors and what they really are. In the illusion you perceive the same color, with the same wave-length differently because your brain is given context, where he is used to seeing shadows in a real world therefore he makes one up for you. If a machine with a detector was to perceive it, it would perceive it without the context and experience processing and give the result objectively.
Just like in the black-blue vs. white-gold dress, the people who saw white-gold were fooled by their brain as it perceived the color with the context of ""oh when things are lit up by light, they are lighter"".

Your points are all totally valid, but the conclusions are meaningless and depressing.

I cannot conform to romanticised 'femaleness' and I will suffer for that too.

"13:39 This is an important point that I think writers like Judith Butler misses in their writing (or at least had not adressed in the pieces I've read of her). By emphasizing the individualistic performativity of gender, they can be misread as essentially claiming that social roles are atomistic: that anyone can be anything if they truly believe so and perform it. What is missed is that gender, and all social roles, are not just the prerogative of the performer, but of the audience as well. Simply put, social roles are relational. Gender is relational. Race is relational. You can claim you are a woman (or a man) all day long, but if no one in your social surroundings accept that, then you are, for all intents and purposes, still the gender you were assigned at birth. This is what's called ""social reality"", which more or less means that if everyone believes something, and act as if though it were true, then very often, it's impossible to challenge that notion, or even consider that it could be false. Just to be clear, I'm not making a value comment here - I'm not saying this is fair or good, or anything like that, but rather that emphasizing performativity without underscoring the crucial role played by audience acceptance is misleading and potentially sets people up to fail (or at least become very frustrated) by not including all the factors of the equation. 

We live, for example, in a world were being ""trans-race"" is essentially impossible, because, in short, it's part of the ""social reality"" that race cannot be changed due to various ideas of what race *is* (ie. deeply materialistic/essentialistic and informed by long-standing power-inequalities that makes such a concept of transition either deeply offensive or outright laughable). I know it might come off as a false equivalence comparing this to changing genders/coming out as transgender, but it's the best analogy I could come up with that shows how we kinda arbitrarily decide what is considered possible and impossible within a cultural framework. Being transgender is of course considered equally impossible in a number of cultures, and no matter the performance would probably just be shot down as eccentrism or insanity. Or if you want to get into some less West-centric issues - consider the issue of changing castes in certain parts of India. That's socially impossible in many cases, no matter how much you change your profession, name, diet, worship practices and so on. In the eyes of many people, your caste is integral to your very physical body and spiritual self, it's a part of the dharmic cosmos, not something you can change.

To use a brutal example: even if you perform man-ness every day of your life, but no one accepts this as a valid performance, then you'll probably end up in a grave with the female birth name, and every historical record naming you as a woman and nothing else. The unreceived or rejected performance is often simply erased.

Now, it is of course possible to challenge social reality, which trans and gay people know a helluva lot more about than me (and I've probably veered too close to cis-splaining as it is, I hope not beyond), but it is hard. It takes time. And it is potentially very, very dangerous. Remembering to get the audience (ie. friends, family, coworkers, neighbors, wider society) along and accepting of the premise of the performance is, whether one likes it or not, crucial if one actually desires full range of expression and acceptance.

"This is the worst ContraPoints video thus far. I don't exactly know the quality has degraded so much, but it is just the same scene, the same everything, but the narcissism is more and more palpable and some of the things written don't sound so tongue-in-cheek anymore. The more recent videos all just seem like a set of strawmen that are set up and made fun of. The dichotomy of the question set up in this video is so false. And I think that ContraPoints is quite isolated politically and publicly due to not having any pushback or healthy conflict from real people, and the result is videos like this. 

There is no nuance in Natalie's argument, and Tabby's is poorly represented and poorly argued as usual. Considering in the past ContraPoints has espoused the viewpoints shown by Natalie here, and seems committed to them personally, going into this video and knowing that the uploader personally agrees with Natalie dampens the entire video for me. It makes it much more obvious that Tabby is misrepresented and other characters are strawmen. If the videos get worse and worse from here, I can't imagine what they'll be like.

_The Shannon entropy of spectral distributions is applied to the problem of color rendering. With this novel approach, calculations for visual white entropy, spectral entropy, and color rendering are proposed, indices that are unreliant on the subjectivity inherent in reference spectra and color samples. The indices are tested against real lamp spectra, showing a simple and robust system for color rendering assessment. The discussion considers potential roles for white entropy in several areas of color theory and psychophysics and nonextensive entropy generalizations of the entropy indices in mathematical color spaces._

If I wanted to pass as a woman (for myself and not in somebody else's view), I wouldn't wear heels, and the problem wouldn't be that heels look wrong on me -- it's just not what womanhood means for me personally. Cis women in my life don't necessarily wear makeup, heels, they don't even always have long hair or wear tight clothes. I'm wondering whether all trans people want to look passable in the eyes of other people or in their own view. Because if the latter is true, then listening and conforming to other people's ideas of gender (even ideas of other trans people) instead of your own would not be a healthy way to view yourself.",0,0,2018-09-19T21:22:05.000Z

"I feel like this hits me kind of hard. I stopped voice training because I didn't feel comfortable conforming to what cis society expected of me as a trans woman. But I think it's unfair to claim that most of us *can* look like that if we put the work in. Many of us are exhausted from transitioning the amount we did. Yes, as white women we have a lot of privilige, hell I probably have more privilige than most living in Sweden, but at the same time we live in a society of relative comforts. 

If you can manage to transition to the amount you want, that's great. But a lot of us can't. It's not always a question of standing up to society. Hell, the only reason I don't voice train today is because I'm exhausted, I don't want to make a political statement anymore and society being shitty to trans women has a part in that, esp when talking about trans women who began their transititions before the ""tipping point"". 

I love this content, but I feel it misses some critical points regarding opportunity to transition and opportunity to play the part society expects from you. I think this also influences why many trans women don't fit into either box of ""aggresive stand-uppy type"" or ""passing fulltime effort"" type. Some of us struggle halfway. 

But I know that maybe wasn't the point you were making. I don't know, I was just made slightly uncomfortable by this, as a trans woman myself having transitioned since 2012. I don't know, just some thoughts. I love you and your content, again. Praise be dark mother",57,4,2018-09-19T21:19:20.000Z

"This is so interesting to me from the perspective of a cis(ish???) lesbian because I shaved my head partially hoping men would stop hitting on me but then shortly after, a man hit on me in a shop when I was with my ex gf who also has short hair. It made me feel stupid for ever thinking anyone would look at me and think 'that person is not into dudes' unless they already knew me. However, I still have uniquely feminine insecurities that make me want to dress nicely and put on 30 minutes worth of makeup every time I leave my flat. I also never really considered that I was anything other than cis before shaving my head but it made me realise that my own gender is sort of capricious. I really like Cameron Esposito's interpretation of gender; she sort of equivocates her own gender to 'David Bowie'- it's just what makes her feel seen, what she feels looks like her aesthetic. I think if I used that method I would say that my gender is 'pisces with a previous emo phase'.",0,0,2018-09-19T21:17:35.000Z

"You know, I'm surprised i actually found a reasonable channel on the left. I've been getting so reactionary and anti sjw these past two years. I never liked trump but after his election and they way the left acted, I became unhappy with them and started supporting trump more out of anger and a way to get back at them. I started watching more right wing red pilled videos like lauren southern, mouthy budda, Alex Jones, sargon, even though he is a liberal, Stefan molyneux, roaming millennial. I was getting very red pilled and started watching more fashy youtube like red ice and James asslup. But then after the Charlottesville debacle I became unhappy all over again with the right this time, I thought why would even the basic conservatives wouldn't call out the alt right, it seems all the blame was towards the left. And then after I watched the Internet debates with the white nationalists, I realized how authoritarian they were and how little they cared for constitutional rights. I'm mexican American, I realized how dangerous they're movement was towards my community. So I'm glad I found your channel, your one of the few people that actually debunks their arguments, and you do it in a funny comedic way.

"As beautifully dizzying as this was. It feels like your gender dysphoria is gerrymandering the definition of woman to allow yourself to identify as a one. If gender is how one performs one's sex then that implies that there is a correct way to perform it, when the way that we perceive gender is descriptive. If men started taking up art instead of sports then art would be the manly thing to do. I am a man therefore anything that I do is manly, as in I am doing it in a way that a man would. If I decide that I want to put on make-up, wear a dress, and suck a dick then descriptively I am doing it like a man because I am a man. I'll grant that masculinity and femininity exist objectively as can be measured by the white to gray matter ratio in the brain. But as far as pronouns go: they are quick approximations to refer to one's sex, if you are lucky enough you might imitate a woman well enough you might be approximated inaccurately. As a thought experiment to determine if pronouns refer to gender or sex I imagine if my ""male"" brain were put into a female body what would I expect people to refer to me as? The answer seems obviously female, to expect anyone to guess that I have a masculine brain would be unfair and to ask someone to refer to me in accordance with how my brain is structured is asking them to break their internal  categorizing mechanisms for me which undermines why we have such faculties in the first place.

"Aesthetics is an interesting part of gender and misgendering. I'm a cis woman and I don't mind being misgendered online where people assume I'm male from my text, but find it hurtful to be misgendered in person. 

Usually it's because the other person is intending insult, and you can write them off as being a dick, but I was once in the very confusing position where someone was genuinely trying to defend me while misgendering me.
Myself  and a boy (let's call him Sam) at school where incredibly similar in height, hair type and hair length. I never wore the skirts that came with school uniform and everything else was the same. If together, we were often mistaken as siblings or even twins. It was something that amused us.
The lad misgendering me meant well- one of his mates called me she and he was trying to defend me by pointing out 'Don't be a dick, he's obviously a guy.' While I knew he was actually defending Sam, and in some ways it was more mistaken identity than misgendering, I was too shocked and confused to speak up while he was listing off all my masculine features and convincing his friend I was Sam/a boy. Other than wearing trousers (which is more unisex now), I thought I looked 'pretty/feminine'. It didn't help when I finally pointed out I wasn't Sam that the lad was embarrassed and got defensive. It hurt and made me put a lot of effort into separating myself from Sam through hairstyle, makeup, wearing skirts and tights. Honestly I hated it and the compliments I got after were strange double edged things that felt like they were rewarding a lie. That I only got to be 'a girl' if I put effort into it. I couldn't just 'be' a girl by virtue of being one. I didn't get to be recognised as my gender unless I played by their rules. 
And yet, I don't mind people misgendering me by text- by my words and personality alone. I've even been told 'No, I don't believe you, you type like a guy' when trying to correct someone. That just baffled me more than insulted me. Sometimes I'm even happy leaving the assumption because it's easier being a guy online. Yet having someone see my, in person, and go 'you look male' hurts.",37,2,2018-09-19T21:06:19.000Z

"Shamans have know this for millennia. Reality is not as important to the human consciousness as the perception of reality. To change perception, one needs to adopt symbolism and make it so authentic that it is more real than the thing it co-opts. We all want to believe that authenticity is king, but it is a pale comparison. 

The burger you make for yourself tastes ten times better than the one from the fast food chain, but you can't spend millions of dollars on commercials that convince everyone that this is true. And that form of advertising propaganda is so strong it reaches even the cynical. 

I _know_ McDonald's tastes like crap but I guarantee that some point this month I will buy it, and be disappointed afterwards. 

Even knowing this doesn't make me immune. 

Also: Tabby I love you and your combat boots stomping oppression. You make my heart pound. But then if my own personal tastes were what drove the world, we wouldn't be stuck in this spectacle of a culture.

You can argue that your points were better, and I think you could argue that people may have favored Blaire's points for reasons beyond the points themselves (I think I remember a few of her responses having a ""don't put feels over reals"" that a lot of people feel strongly about, for instance, or even simply that since it was on her channel, there were more of her fans), but I think it's pretty dishonest to claim that ""people just felt she had won because she was prettier"".

"I have no problem with trans women being women or participating in life as women, but you lose me when you say that gender is purely a performance.  Menstruation isn't performance, giving birth isn't performance. There are many elements of femininity that are the direct effect of biological experience of womanhood and its reprocussions. I am in favor of inclusivity of trans women in the community of women, and I respect their identities as women, but I run up against a brick wall when I am told that my biological reality as a woman is meaningless and that if I acknowledge those elements of my womenhood that trans women do not share, then I am a TERF and thereby the enemy.  Seriously I want to be your ally and advocate but that seems impossible because I would have to subvert my own lived experience as a woman and mother in order to be an ally?

"Besides not being a fan of the word Aesthetic, every point that Tabby made resonated and the other character felt like she was just throwing words out there. I also cringed at the proposed definition of Art in this. However, the reason I resonated with Tabby is because I feel like there are people who just can't make personas. There is an element in Contra's videos where the characters represent an idea of Decadency and they push that value onto others, like how it was pushed on Tabby, but conversely, could it be that Tabby's Decadency is having value in who she is and feels comfortable in being? In essence, while the two characters wouldn't each use the word Decadency, they each represent a different kind of it in their striving for self-affirmed value.",9,9,2018-09-19T20:54:55.000Z

"I'm a Cis, straight, white male and realize that I was born on a mountain of privilege.  That being said, I never thought of my gender as performative.  Even when I was little I remember really disliking what I felt was expected of me as a man.  I grew up in the rural Midwest to a father who had very clear expectations for me.  Still, I was more feminine than those expectations and more performative (I liked doing impressions of men and women from film and television).  It was only acceptable at the time because I made him and everyone else laugh.  I also realize now how lucky I was to be able to do that, how I sort of tricked my way out of having to be what my father and many others wanted me to be.  

Regardless, this video made me think of that.  It made me realize how privileged I was both to be able to do those things with little question and how much I take for granted now.  Now-a-days I just wear whatever with little thought.  I suppose I put on a bad performance because I'm not all that interested in it, but that's partially because it seems like no one cares about it.  I'm just not questioned and scrutinized like so many others are.  Thank you for the video and I'm going to have to become a Patreon supporter because all your videos are fantastic.

If I look like that as a cis woman, am I also not good enough? But it feels like Im in the wrong for feeling this way because being a trans woman is much harder and more important than my cis feelings. I dont bring it up to them because I wouldnt want to make them feel like Im judging their wanting to transition, but some elements of transition do genuinely feel mysoginistic sometimes. I hated myself so bad as a teenage girl that I felt like I didnt deserve to live. Is that not also suffering? Arent trans women and cis women in the same prison sometimes?

"I made this long comment. But do I  ""b e l i e v e""  in it?...    or is it just a ""p e r f o r m a n c e""?: -

""Destiny"" describes himself as an ""egoist"" - but also someone who is educated and rational and self-conscious, which he argues stops him from being selfish while also ensuring he looks after his best interests. It's an interesting rhetorical take (though not a new one) with regards to debate as you can not really argue with it - unless you know him personally (where he says that he is much less of an egoist to his loved ones). I'm kind of paraphrasing, but I'm sure you get the idea.

I respect Destiny a lot. But I imagine that you don't personally have an egoist position (I like to  i m a g i n e  :P). But (this is where my face goes all wrong from falling head first into an automatic paper shredder in some back storage room and don't get discovered for a few weeks until the janitor does a routine clear-up)..    Does Destiny ""believe"" he is an egoist?...

I'm wondering about beliefs in the context of an ever-changing technologically advancing society - where basically what your parents know is useless for applying in the time you live in...  and, similarly, what you know won't serve anyone in the future as it'll be redundant. In this case, it does you well not to hold strong beliefs - as they will also have to keep changing. But at the same time, without strong beliefs you may find it difficult to react effectively (though there is also the argument that you would be more flexible). I guess it is interesting to think about how your relation to an ever-changing world effects your relationship to yourself and those either close to you or distant from you. Of course this has been well looked into (I'm just crap and haven't properly looked into it).

"If I can pose a counter argument on Tabby's behalf (about 13 1/2 mins in): 

On the flip side, if someone else calls you a helicopter, does that make you a helicopter? Sure, people can call you things that are hurtful, and sometimes it hurts because it's a painful truth, but the source of the hurt in a case like that is the fact that it doesn't reflect the inner experience being a human (or a cat, I suppose); it's because you're not a helicopter that you would be bothered by being called one, and not some secret painful inner truth of being a helicopter. 

Ergo, misgendering can be a kind of perceived robbing of gender, but it is only painful *because* of how it contradicts the inner experience, so it isn't an actual robbing of gender so much as a perceptual one - not a painful truth, but a painful *untruth*. Aesthetics can help others (and maybe the self) to navigate away from such untruth, but even in the absence of the aesthetic and the benefits that come with it, the inner truth is still what it is. In this way, the effort to stamp out misgendering is really an effort to promote truth, aesthetics or no. Does that track...? 

I mean I guess that's where they end up going anyway, I was just a little surprised that Tabby didn't seize the opportunity to flip the helicopter analogy back around.

"I‚Äôm reminded of the music video for Jay-Z‚Äôs Death of Autotune. Seriously, bear with me.

The song and video are all about authenticity, how Jay-Z is actually an authentic ‚Äúgrew up in the hood‚Äù street gangster.

But how is that shown visually? Not through the aesthetics of what he authentically is (if nothing else a black man who became successful), it‚Äôs all the aesthetics of The Godfather and The Sopranos.

He‚Äôs in an Italian restaurant where the chef pays him his respect, then goes to play cards in the back with Harvey Kietel. The whole thing is showing that he‚Äôs an authentic black rapper by posing him as an ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù (i.e the media version) of a white Italian mobster.",6,0,2018-09-19T20:40:19.000Z

"This was such a good video Contra! The ""debate"" about how trans women perform femininity has always bothered me immensely (same with how trans men do masculinity, but trans men are almost never seen in media). Trans folk get judged on how we perform our identity every second it feels like. I'm a fairly young genderqueer kid and I haven't had much time yet in figuring all of it out, but I've been thinking a lot of this recently. If how I perform is masculine or feminine, and how I'm being seen by everyone else around me because of that ""performance"". Especially since I don't fit into the binary, there isn't an ""ideal"" non-binary model I can adhere to or try to perform. I don't put much time into changing my body and if you didn't ask me for my pronouns, you'd probably guess my assigned gender directly. I have some self-evaluation to do I think.

Just like all those famous 19th century bourgie artists didn't say ""Fuck the workers and Africa,"" they're art still upholds that philosophy.

A man can become a woman, through drag, but womanhood is different to manhood in that men are the default human.idk this seemed overly neurotic.

"""I'm actually a lady who used to be a man dressed as a man dressed as a lady""

That's pretty easy to explain really. It's an interesting use of varying definitions being used in conjunction with each other to make a simple statement seem complex or even unexplainable. I'll break it down by replacing the definitions for the words.


Im actually (a person who exhibits/embraces characteristics and mannerisms which are commonly associated with femininity) who used to be a (person who exhibits/embraces characteristics and mannerisms which are commonly associated with masculinity) portraying a (person who exhibits/embraces characteristics and mannerisms which are commonly associated with masculinity)  dressed as (a person who exhibits/embraces characteristics and mannerisms which are commonly associated with femininity).

Interestingly the entire sentence could also be preceded by ""I am a male who is actually a lady...."" and still be entirely true while also providing some concrete and practical knowledge unlike the original which tells us nothing of any use to anyone besides yourself.",4,0,2018-09-19T20:13:10.000Z
"This is something I picked up on while I was watching Blaire White. It's so easy to tell throughout the debate and her content that the conservatives that support her would never do it if she didn't ""pass"" as a cis woman so well. Being able to see a trans woman who resembles a cis female so well is easier for them to digest, therefore they go along with that while still spouting nonsense like Riley Dennis isn't trans because she didn't ""pass"" as well according to them. It's sad really.",97,3,2018-09-19T20:12:57.000Z

"I don't know how I feel about this one. Yes, you may get a few concessions by conforming, but those concessions will end up gated behind conforming too, since it's the image you took to get them. If we're just fighting for the right of passing transwomen, rather than every nonbinary and nonconforming person, we're going to end up alone very quickly. So yeah, if the goal is to let the luckiest few get the same misogynistic treatment cis women get, that works. But if that's the goal, I'd rather go down fighting the real fight for everyone oppressed. I'm not saying the point about aesthetics isn't valid, but we should fight under the aesthetics we want to be recognized under, not those they want to impose on us, because we'll only win the rights to be the fake self we showed.",81,24,2018-09-19T20:08:37.000Z
