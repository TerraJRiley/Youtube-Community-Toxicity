I would like to make a request for a future video; the 2017 ""Power Rangers"" reboot movie; I could see it being a good fit as a topic for your channel, given how it got a mixed reception at the time of it's release.

"This is the only found footage film I have seen that I have actually enjoyed.  I do think Matt is a jerk to begin with, but I also think at the end he realized just how much he contributed to Andrew's breaking.  While this doesn't absolve him of guilt, I think he fully understands that.  Much like Peter Parker not stopping the robber who murder's Uncle Ben, if he could go back, he would change it, but he can't.

"Teaser frame: A quiet place. Good one to do. 


I kind of agree with what you said about Andrew and Matt. While Andrew set down his own path Matt could've been a better influence. But I think when he got the powers he slowly I mean slowly starts to grow a little and tries to be a better influence. Sure he still does some stupid things but he's still a highschooler. Not justifying his actions but it's to tell he hasnt fully learned yet. It isnt until Andrew is fully gone is when Matt's redemption arc starts but we dont get as much sympathy from him seeing how the sequel never happened.

Though, I think there area couple of places where if he had just made one different decision it could have gone the other way. The camera zooming in in the hospital was a nice indication of where Andrew was in his own story. that was the moment he struck back. That's zoom is typically used in revenge films to show the hero reaching the end of his rope and going after the villains. Matt being the hero in his own story used the same shot to announce that he was going after the bad guys of his story.

"I agree with you that I don't think ""Evil"" is something that is ""natural"" in a human. 
I also think Evil actions means something is wrong in a person. I mean they are literally called ""Evil actions"" *because* they are wrong, but I have a friend who said that he thinks people have more or less ""Evil"" in them, and that it's kind of black and white. I don't agree with that, mostly because ""evil"" is so hard to define, and everyone has a different definition of it. 
I can buy that some people are born with more or less empathy or sympathy for other people, but my opinion on the debate of ""Nature vs. Nurture"" is that it's 20% Nature and 80% Nurture, or even 10% Nature and 90% Nurture. 

Maybe Andrew had less empathy even from the beginning, but I don't think he would have gone down this path if he didn't have the family life he had. People with Less Empathy, aren't necessarily Evil by Nature, but they have higher potential of doing something our society would Label ""evil"", with that said, I am absolutely convinced that those kinds of people can get the assistance they need to be able to live a life free from ""evil"" actions. And conversely, a person who is by all measures ""Good"", with a lot of empathy and sympathy can be pushed to do Evil things if the circumstances get dire enough. 

I remember liking Matt when I saw this movie the first time, because he ""is"" the ""good guy"", since he stops the ""bad guy"" from killing people, and he seems like an okay guy in general. But watching your video just now made me really dislike him. I really dislike him for probably Knowing what's happening in Andrew's family life, and Not being there for him, I dislike him for making fun of him and ""bullying"" him into doing things he's not comfortable with. And my sympathy and empathy for Andrew has grown a lot. He really is the victim in this movie, a tragic character of tragic circumstance. But I also think that this is a testament to the quality of this movie, it really makes you think about the nature of humanity and morality.

"Movies like this freak me out. The story telling is good and everything but I don't know the more they make movies where a character has tragic past that morphs them into evil the harder it is when you're a real person with the same circumstance.

It'll like the normalization that's happened with mental illness and how it ""leads to violence"".

As someone from an abusive household who was at the same time bullied at school the stereotype that often got me in trouble was the idea that bullied kids snap. My classmates constantly spread the rumor of me becoming the next school shooter or something and i legitimately got punished for a rumor.

I can't really enjoy these kind of movies anymore because my empathy  makes it difficult to watch.",0,0,2018-10-21T17:49:29.000Z,Dirk Sirian,UCqYkL9zZVKJO9eK9SchAzlQ,ydHEGhQghPY,True,Ugy26Yd2wvLZEwAwI914AaABAg

"So, here's my two cents. Andrew was abused in both home, and in school. When your stuck between those two places, and your friends is on either one or both side, or is just unsympathetic, it can mess you up. I was on that spectrum and it led me to almost take my own lofe. I'm better now, but I can see where Andrew was coming from. There are times where I wanted to lash out and hurt the people who hurt me. School peers, bullies, my friends, even my parents. But it just takes one bad day for someone to snap. Andrews entire life was one bad day that just never ended. Until he found his friends and that was a solice. At least for a while. Then when one dies that could have been his fault (I still don't know is Andrew conjured up that lightning storm or  not) and his mother getting worse and his father laying into him worse, it's not surprising to see him go off the deep end. And yes, it was as much his cousins fault as it was Andrews.

"I do enjoy the video a huge ton but I do have to really disagree with how much you make Andrew out to be as if he is a good guy. 

I understand that he has all these terrible things in life and It's terrible and horrible. But it's almot like you're overjustifying (Is that even a real word?) His actions.

 But his whole arc is almost like an allegory for how a kid would become a school shooter, that's a bit of a stretch I know but still, he hurt tons of people and was trying to kill innocents, people who did him no wrong. 

And I feel like you're making Matt out to be waaaay worse then he actually is. If it was just Matt and Steve who got the powers they wouldn't have started killing people. 

And yes Matt was a jerk but it wasn't anything that would actually hurt people. he just wanted to have fun just like Steve really. 

And after everything he goes to the mountains and what looks like a monastery so i imagine it is like he wants to find forgiveness because he realize he also screwed up, and just like Andrew, Matt is also now all alone.",0,0,2018-10-21T17:10:02.000Z,Thad Henry,UCBiTuNqsy5v82iRjoE3aELQ,ydHEGhQghPY,True,UgxbMoP0g4slK9qX_1R4AaABAg

"I never disliked this film. It was alright, too similar to “A new Hope” which made me think that the next few films would follow the same formula, which therefore made me think the next movie will go this way, and so on and so forth. Then the next movie failed. Which then brought me back to this one, because it made me think “if this was better, imagine how great the next movie could have been!” Before the last Jedi, I didn’t care that Finn was fine with killing former comrades. Because he sucked in the last Jedi I looked for plot lines he should have followed, and then came back here.

I also feel matt will always feel responsible for what happened whether he realizes he was a jerk to Andrew himself or just for never trying to help protect him from the other elements that led to his final decisions or even leading them all to the thing that gave them power in the first place

"nah, that's ignoring all of the character themes. tony's going to be the survivor. he's the mcu's cassandra. every prediction he's made has come true, even against other people's belief, except for his wanda-induced vision in aou and baby morgan in iw, and i bet my favourite cutesy seal dress that those are coming up soon

steve and tony are two sides of a coin. foils. steve is the past, and tony is the future, but they're both stuck in the present, unable to be where they belong. so tony works towards the future; he lays the foundations for his kids to build upon. steve, though... just doesn't. in ca:cw, the conflict regarding the accords is that tony wants to pre-emptively prevent another sokovia, while steve's mistrust stems from the fact that the last organisation he entrusted with the world's safety turned out to be hydra

steve has nothing to build on. he has no home to go to. the world has changed, and he hasn't, despite his efforts. tony, however, has tried to retire, so many times, but he can't, because the world still needs him. but, now, the world has spider-man. it has the new avengers. it has every kid who saw the avengers fight, and who won't stand by and watch anymore, and who will build on the foundations

it's not a coincidence that red skull, cap's first antagonist, is at vormir. it's not a coincidence that, in exchange for the soul stone, you have to sacrifice the one you love most. that's not love, though

it's not a coincidence that howard stark manufactured the serum and shield of captain america; that steve's rebirth was at the hands of a stark (even if he did end up being a jerk)

i don't think that it's a coincidence that, in tony's wanda-vision, his focus was on steve

i don't think it's a coincidence that tony is linked so heavily to death, but that he is not allowed to die

i don't think it's a coincidence that thanos in the comics loved the embodiment of death, and in infinity war, he is over and over again contrasted with tony, and hopes that they remember him. i don't think it's a coincidence that tony ""you know who i am"" stark is shocked that thanos knows his name. i don't think it's a coincidence that tony's main weapons are his gauntlets, and that he experiences phantom pain in his left arm. i don't think it's a coincidence that both thanos and tony lost a child. i don't think it's a coincidence that the final shot of thanos in iw is of him watching the sunrise on a farm, alone, because he killed and pushed away his family

tl;dr: tony's gonna take a leaf out of clint's book and build pepper a farm and retire on it. the lease will say potts. the continued existence of his left arm is up in the air, though",0,0,2018-10-21T14:50:09.000Z,Nemnyoom,UCvDJM3o_h9qctvrXedjuggg,y3j8v-MHGtQ,True,Ugwml6AM6YE4GKFJ8Fp4AaABAg

The guardian was pretty weird and kind of emotionless. And Lothar was just... Uh. Everytime there was a storyline of... You know, the guardian or Lothar or these people, I thought to myself:,, yeah cool and stuff, but when we get to see the orcs again? ''. The humans were just boring.

"The Russos confirmed Avengers 4 won't simply undo Infinity War's stakes. Also I'm sorry but Star-Lord wasn't out of character if you watch the final battle in GOTG Vol 2 you know Star-Lord is emotionally unstable. And for your explanation about why didn't Thanos double the resources (while sort of right) isn't the official reason given by the directors was that Thanos was really obsessed with his plan that he only was focusing on his plan and his plan only and his idea was supported by the death of his planet. Another simpler reason why he didn't do it was becuase the Infinity Gauntlet isn't capable of doubling the resources it can't create matter from nothing it can minuplate it but not create it out of thin air.

Like you said, getting out to the theater with a one-year-old proved unfeasible for this movie, and I think a lot of people had to triage their summer film budget and Solo suffered for not being Infinity War.  If it had come out even a month later, it probably would have done a lot better box office.


That said, I loved it for what it was.  It was never going to be a big, sweeping, epic Star Wars story, just a nice, small, starter story for Han Solo's character, and I think it was perfectly successful at being that.

"After watching this movie a few times, I’m more able to look past its flaws and appreciate the cinematic quality there, both on the surface and underneath. It’s great at telling the story, the acting and dialogue are really good and the universe-building and themes are really engaging and leaves me thinking about it during and well after it ends. I mean it’s not something I can just flick on whenever for some entertainment, but it’s a movie that’s fun to theorize and think about, as well as appreciating its subtleties. On a final note, I think it’s a great sort of evolution (well precursor I should say) of the body horror that Alien is so famous for. It’s deeply disturbing because it feels like such an inside-and out sexual and physical violation that we can barely do anything about, aliens shoving themselves down your throat, gestating inside you and exiting like a monstrous unwanted baby or plain just brutalizing you to make something new. It really feels like it belongs in this universe while having some fresh new additions to this cinematic universe.
On a final “final note”, Fassbender’s performance in this film just stuns me. His delivery, characterization and mannerisms are so intriguing and engaging, I sort of see him as the main character, despite being by human standards a kind of evil maniac, it’s completely understandable why he is who he is, which really makes me see Weyland  as the main antagonist, as he is the architect of most conflict in the film. So no matter what David says or does it just makes him more interesting, and that wouldn’t work without Fassbender.",0,0,2018-10-20T10:50:08.000Z,SwenglishGamer,UCs1guA5GRwDsU3sr6rUiZ3Q,yNP6npTaxjY,True,Ugx22l_zL4IDaeZGTa94AaABAg

"So I missed out on the theatrical run of this movie due to some stuff going on in my life but I was lucky enough to catch a showing at one of those 'Pay $3 for a ticket a week before it comes out on DVD' theatres.  All in all I'm pretty happy with Solo.  Back in middle school I found the Han Solo Trilogy by Ann C. Crispin and it made me love the character even more.  You saw him break free of an abusive father figure who forced him into a life of crime, get his start making small runs for Hutts, eventually break out of that life to try and go straight at the imperial academy, and so much more.  This movie hit all of the points that made that trilogy so enjoyable to read and there are  A LOT of parallels in the narrative such as Han helping finance the Rebellion, his first love betraying him on a big score job, and his relationship with Lando never being friends as much as professional trust in a life where that is hard to find.

All in all I really enjoyed it, hell I have only seen the movie twice now and I still think it is my favorite post-Disney acquisition Star Wars movie.  Rogue One was a fantastic movie but it felt awfully safe for their first stand alone.  As you said this movie scaled everything down to a more personal level, especially the finale.  And while Rogue One was cool aside from Jyn and K2S0 I couldn't remember anyone's name after my first viewing of it.  Where as Solo I remembered everyone because they kept things focused, introduced everyone at a reasonable pace, and gave each character time for us to get to know them a bit.",0,0,2018-10-20T07:34:01.000Z,SteveVerstaka,UCgfMZoVG4WiPU6VfWOKdZag,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgxQDIca_jtcVhQhUi14AaABAg

Starlord was the only problem with them not getting that gauntlet. Couldn't Strange just, I don't know, open a portal and teleport Starlord like a mile or two away while they got the gauntlet off? Because once that's off, all they need to do is retreat and leave Thanos on that planet. He would have no way of getting off, at least for a good while. So then all they would have to do is wait for Vision's stone to be destroyed, then possibly use Wanda to destroy the rest of them (if that's even possible). The Time stone would be the only one they would have to destroy really, because then the rest become useless for Thanos' plan. Thor would of gotten his hammer, and could have reunited with all of the Avengers to finish off Thanos on Titan, as well. I doubt Thanos could get off the planet that quickly, since everything happens within less than an hour.

Other than that, this movie was near flawless to me. I freaking LOVE this movie.",0,0,2018-10-19T20:17:31.000Z,Desuo,UC4wmxEQZGJwmVzjQ_VkZdKA,-M6HnyBp5Vo,True,UgzJf1n23kw6eVOPM3R4AaABAg

"I think you should have mentioned the part where Aragorn in pinned to a tree be a shield at his neck. That shot was really dangerous for Viggo Mortensen, because he got stuck when the real-steel sword came at him. He also parries an actual projectile with his sword, I think a dagger, that was unintentionally thrown to close to his body; had he missed, he could have been hurt quite badly. In The Two Towers, the shot in which Aragorn kicks a helmet and shouts in pain and sorrow when he believes Merry and Pippin are dead was actually several takes in, and was the shot in which Viggo broke his toe when kicking the helmet.

Superman was Superman,  Wonder Woman was Gal Gadot... sorry Wonder woman... Aquaman was an amazing casting choice, Cyborg was exactly what I was looking for in a live action Cyborg...

"Dear Mr. Cinemawins man (sorry I don't really know your name), I haven't been a subscriber for long or a long time viewer, but I think your videos are amazing. My favorite has to be the Black Panther. Now onto the main reason I'm leaving this long comment. I was wondering if you could do a Cinemawins video on the most recent version of The Magnificent Seven. I think it's an amazing movie, the style of how it's filmed and the characters are developed are fantastic. My favorite part of it is that the score of the movie was made by a man who passed away in a plane crash, but he made the movie score by reading the script. It's amazing how much time and effort was put into the movie and I'm sure it'd make an amazing Cinemawins video. If you do or don't, I'm ok with it.

"While I've not seen this movie in its entirety, having only seen a few clips here and there, my main issue in terms of Mythological accuracy is the physical appearance of Apophis/Apep (I don't know which name they used in the movie). In the mythology, Apophis was almost always depicted as a snake, or other serpent, so where the movie made it look like a giant galactic sand worm kind of bugged me.

As a side note, Ra's  boat isn't to far off from the most accepted version of his mythology, really the only difference being that in the myths Ra's boat *was* the sun, instead of dragging the sun behind it.

"Han Solo was never my favourite character so I was on the fence about a spin off, I still want a proper Obi Wan spin off, but this has convinced me (along with Rogue One which is probably in my top 10 films) that Disney can handle the spin offs, the jury is still out on the main Star Wars, it's all about how Ep9 resolves for me, Ep8 may have a lot of flaws or _may have an interesting new direction_ it just depends on if they stick the landing.

The visuals were incredible as always CGI pushing new boundaries, practical effects were great, the aesthetics were really well done too, its hard to make sand, snow and muddy trenches look visually interesting because often they are so flat and monocolourated but they did a staggeringly good job with the filmmaking and photography contrasting the sky with the sand and the black rocks with the white snow. Bits like the Enfys Nest killing people is meant to show that the Rebellion is a little more complicated than good and bad, she is closer to Saw Guerrera and his Chaotic Good than Mon Mothma's Paragons. So many people are overlooking good writing as ""not good because it doesn't spoon feed us"" especially when those people are willing to overlook mistakes in other films in order to make DisneyWars seem worse by comparison. Set dressing was fantastic. _All the pieces that are the bones of the film, the skeleton, were amazing._

Even if the story didn't grab people it was still a well made film which unfortunately under-performed due to the early release. I've seen very little valid criticism of story that wasn't ""muh woms anti fembot!"" and ""hurr durr they said SOLO so its bad"" I for one really like the way that Rogue One corrected (retcon) the old exhaust port meme and this one took care of the ""ackthually a parsec is a measurement of distance **SNORT** not time!"" so I'm really looking forward to what other things get corrected.

I'll always believe in the doctrine of quantity, give us more stuff and let us decide if we like it, Ep8 doesn't ruin Star Wars, neither does the Holiday Special, if you don't like them then don't watch them, if you only like the prequels and nothing else then keep watching that, and maybe some day (thanks to a quantity doctrine) there will be another TV series or some Pre-prequel films about the KOTOR times or whatever. *I for one can't get enough of the ""actual"" Star Wars time, the OT, Rogue One, Solo, Rebels, IMPS, Star Wars TIE Fighter (dear god I want a modern TIE Fighter game AND 1313 while you're at it EA all will be forgiven!) and it looks like I'm going to be getting more, if that means Disney needs to sell Porg toys to kids then who the fuck cares?

Seriously Star Wars fans are odd, they are some of the most amazing and worst people I have ever met, some create a 2 minute long animation of building the Death Star in CGI for their University or write an anime pilot about TIE fighters then animate it all themselves, some will even write fan fiction about being a janitor, or the whole team behind TROOPERS and IMPS; and some bitch and whine because ""bombs shouldn't fall in space"" or a lady has pink hair and they don't like it because it gives them a strange feeling in their 'no no square'

So by God am I going to go to Disney's Star Wars hotel, by God am I going to buy Star Wars food in the restaurant and by God am I going to try and find somewhere which still does the Secrets of the Empire VR thing that I missed in London because nobody thought to advertise it where I live. *Because I am a FAN!* _Because I love Star Wars._ And I don't think there should be some arbitrary limit imposed on what bits you can and can't like to be a fan, just the same basic decency everyone should be afforded.",0,0,2018-10-18T15:32:24.000Z,British Ball,UCAE0TQ8Q-Sze-5XSuM_eFAg,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgymzeudVDbIaVsGJFB4AaABAg

"The ending of this video feels a bit odd to me, because like you say, it goes a bit negative when CinemaWins has always been about trying to see the good side of things. So one way to see the ""good side"" of people having different opinions about star wars is that it can help keep the universe fresh--if one film fails for audiences the execs will always be back to try something new. And people having an opinion on Star Wars (even positive ones, like CinemaWins) is a good thing because it means the fans have passion about it.

I hated the Darth Vader fight scene in this movie. You can feel ""sorry"" for me for that all you want, but I loved plenty of other scenes in the film and not everyone has to love the same exact play by plays.

"My 3 reasons this film didn’t perform like the other Disney Star Wars is this:

1. Fans were skeptical with Alden’s Han Solo character and that’s fine. At least go into the theatre with an open mind and see for yourself. I thought he did good imo 

2. Fans were also disappointed with TLJ and frustrated like me. Yes, I’m one of those haters but the way Luke’s character was treated and how Rey is a Mary Sue just irritates me. And so people didn’t think Solo was gonna be that great either. 

3. The film came out at the wrong time. Squeezed right in between Infinity War and Jurassic World as well as Deadpool 2 and Incredibles 2 was probably not a good idea for Solo to come out. Idk tbh, but I think that if this movie waited until December it probably would’ve helped at least.

Overall I liked this movie, better than TLJ imo and it sucks that it didn’t perform as big as the others. Ron Howard was a great director. All the actors did great too. Small things like how Han got his last name wasn’t great, but cameos like Darth Maul with the same actor was definitely a win. I hope Ron Howard realizes that he made a great film and not just look at the popcorn sales and reviews.",3,0,2018-10-18T03:55:00.000Z,DJ Bubbles,UCdG38LkmldJsZ6foADsBMlA,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgxG08a2t1zRT-qthXR4AaABAg

"I consider The Dark Knight as the best superhero movie of all time. Realistic, compelling and it has the best portrayal of Joker in any cinematic version of him. Another thing I find great about this movie, apart from the great acting and cinematography are the costumes. Case in point, Christian Bale’s Batman compared to that of Ben Affleck’s. Bale’s version is functional. Affleck’s isn’t bad, though, and more comics-accurate. But man the cape of Bale’s Batman is simply awesome!!!! The people behind its creation are geniuses!!!!!! And Nolan showcases that cape in some of the most awesome ways possible. Noticed some scenes where the cape is longer than usual just to make Batman’s stance more menacing? Yeah, genius!!!!  I’m a big fan of superhero movies, DC and Marvel, but this is the best of them.

Tony went to Titan, unwilling to endanger people in the same manner as in 2012, and also because of the fact that he still had a hard fall-out with Steve. If you notice, whilst he's in the Sanctum Sanctorium with Banner, Strange and Wong, he was so reluctant to call Steve, and the manner in which he didn't hesitate to get on the Q-Ship underlines his fractured relationship and his unwillingness to fight alongside Steve.",0,0,2018-10-17T18:04:22.000Z,MotherRussia 1001,UCTEbGvq37J3WNxLo-W-Zc6g,GvYY4TLaF5g,True,Ugwnak6Ay5zxNJyA6494AaABAg

"My favorite scene of the movie is the entire time Po talks to Shifu when he's trying to leave, because I always appreciate it when films aren't afraid to tackle the issue of Lack of Self Confidence. I suffer from extremely low self esteem so it hits home when a movie touches that issue in some way, and while it may not have discussed straight up Self Loathing (like I have often), the line ""It hurt but it didn't hurt more than living everyday being me"" and ""If ANYONE could make me...NOT me, IT WAS YOU"" are relatable and with a message such as ""All you need to be great is to believe in yourself"" it's just one of my favorite lessons movies teach.

"It is a very sad display of a man who can’t pull his head out of his wife’s nethers, watches movies he has no strong opinion about half-assedly, and simply can’t admit that he’s got nothing to say.

When you reviewed Force Awakens, one could practically feel the same way you felt, when (imagination mode ON) “some jerk said that it’s just a lazy cash grab”.
I get it. You don’t care anymore. You are tired.
But that’s no excuse for being thoughtless and unobservant.
It’s just making you a pitiful and passive moron.
Stop.
Take a break.
Cuddle with your make-beliefs, think about your life, admit that you’re doing this only for your own self.

"Still one of the best movies of its kind. Why?
1. I have experienced anxiety attacks and the movie was spot on. 
Tony is exactly the kinda guy who would get anxiety, because his smarter than most people around him, he feels a huge responsibility and he always keeps things to himself. It builds up, fight or flight mechanism starts and adrenaline pumps through veins, heartbeat goes up, but the mind knows you cant do anything to eliminate the threat. The fact that he didn't know whats happening at first was so real too.
2. Picturing terrorism realistically. It might not go with the fictional comic story type, but it was the best part of the movie. A bit surprising to see in a US made movie.
The fact that some powerful figures in shadows using terrorism for their benefits is actually whats happening in our real world. Creating fear in people, building up hatred towards each other or specific race or nation or religion, and using people's reaction to justify the action they're going to take.

I don't think Cap is one to retire, he never runs from a fight and is not one to turn his back on the world. Plus, if he retires, we will know he's alive in the MCU. He's not old(physically) so they can't say he passed away or something as an excuse as to why he won't return. Especially since Evans is officially done with Cap. Killing him off is the only way to have people not ask why Cap doesn't how up to the next big event Marvel has planned. The only other solution I see, besides recasting(please don't Marvel, Evans IS Cap), is a theory that Cap will get sent back in time and be with Peggy. But yea, Tony is dead.

Oh and I like Tom Cruise in almost everything he does but I was pissed because he did it fit my minds eye of what Reacher looked like that’s the only reason I was upset about him being Reacher,0,0,2018-10-16T15:06:14.000Z,oldman baller50,UCsD2AHA4nlCa4FVRl-0E1YA,2US0OkmY8M4,True,UgwLv944xvr3SDRaZ194AaABAg

This was M. Night Shyamalan's true first return to form before we even had Split. The hate this movie gets blows my mind as not only is a great character arc driven movie but its also an at times stunningly beautiful one. Sure the limited budget can show at times but then M. Night shows once again just how well he can make world building more in our minds than the budget will allow. A film about how our inner fears control us so hard and how we must adapt to it to have any chance of becoming who we were always intended to be. The fact there's a real life father son connection at its heart makes the film all the better IMO and Jaden Smith's acting range is superb yet all i ever hear is how bad he is.

"I know that it's been a while since this video was posted, but it is, of course, still a tremendous fave of mine; one thing, in particular, that I'm moved to comment on, is at 15:54 in, when CinemaWins very specifically points out the fact that Proxima Midnight was deliberately, and masterfully, deceiving Cap and Black Widow when she first confronted them, and clearly implied at the time that Corvus Glaive had perished from his wound....even though, of course, as we saw soon enough, that was very much *not* the case.  Initially we were led to think that Natasha's needling comment of, ""Where's your other friend?"" had in fact very much gotten under Proxima's skin and riled her, since we know from IW that Proxima and Corvus are close and they clearly care for each other (and it's been since confirmed that they were very much a romantic item, which need only be implied in IW, and we still get it perfectly well).

However, with Proxima's communication of, ""She's on the field.  Take it!"", and with the fact that Corvus was seen only instants later, having made it into Shuri's lab - that in itself proves, with such perfect unspoken clarity, the true genius of the Black Order's plan in this case.  Proxima Midnight played Cap and Nat, et al, *perfectly* , and they fell right into the trap, because they were, understandably, wholly unaware of it.  She wanted them to think that she'd been provoked or goaded by this needling mention of Corvus, as though he had been slain by Natasha's hand after all - when, in fact, nothing was further from the truth....but she used their ignorance of this truth against them, and weaponized it, if you will.  It was very much to the advantage of the Black Order, and they seized upon it.  What makes this development and the realization of it such a stroke of genius is the simple fact that it's *not* blatantly called out in the course of the film; it's *very* subtly and masterfully laid in there, but overt attention is not called to it....because it doesn't *need* to be.

But for those who pick up on it, and who can follow the thread back to this conclusion, it's an instantaneous OMG and true shock moment - this singular realization that Proxima and Corvus were playing a long game here, and one of which the Avengers et al were wholly unwitting....as was the audience, of course, until it actually transpired.  I'm very pleased and impressed that CinemaWins specifically pointed this out, because I have seen next to *no one* else who apparently cottoned to it - not when the movie first released, nor even well after the fact.

*I* did, of course, as did my GF with whom I saw it; we both realized (through our extreme emotional trauma afterwards) just what had been going on there, and just how perfectly and subtly it was laid in; but it's seemed to me that, in the main, people don't seem to have caught on to it, or are really taking note of this for what it is: a masterfully-laid plan on the part of the Black Order, and a genius story element laid in with perfect subtlety by the Russo's and Markus/McFeely - rewarding those of us who pay such exquisite attention to these films! :)

In any case, I merely wanted to thank CinemaWins *so* much for remarking on and, consequently, winning this moment and this realization; it's heartening to know that at least *one* other person out there caught on to this. :)  It's the small and subtle moments, every bit as much as the grand and intricate and astonishing ones, which truly make the film - and which, all of them, do weave together into such an astoshiningly and Marvellously (pun intended!) tapestry as a whole! :D",0,0,2018-10-16T00:09:06.000Z,Dawn Richardson,UC4RDcuckHtG03O1NJY5BXPw,-M6HnyBp5Vo,True,UgzQxp0xSKXpmD5pNf14AaABAg

Here are some nippicky things that I really didn't like about this movie. They turned Iron man into Blue Beetle. They gave Thor an eye at practically the beginning so that was pointless. Everytime someone talks about how powerful Thanos will be they always say that he could wipe out half the universe with a snap of his fingers and surprise surprise that's exactly what he does. Two of the most powerful members of the Avengers have trouble with Thanos' kids but the mostly non-powered ones have almost no issues with them. The massive battle on Earth is kinda pointless.And the fact that Thanos creates a giant army and paints himself as the biggest  threat in the universe just take the stones do his thing then quit to live on a farm.

"I really liked this film. CinemaWins touches on it in the commentary, but I really liked that it was a small story. The Star Wars universe is a grimy place, with criminals and seedy sides to most places. It was good to get a story dealing with that, rather than ""the stuff of history that will decide the fate of the galaxy"" - that's almost every other Star Wars film. I was also really pleased to have a Star Wars film without Force users (OK, Maul makes an appearance, but his powers aren't really relevant). Force users are rare, so we should be seeing stories where they don't appear. And by not having Force users, we get to see normal people being badasses and not being overshadowed by someone with superpowers.

"I get that your arguments are what the movies have shown, but that's exactly why fans of the extended universe didn't like these movies.  It shows a very abridged view of the official universe.  Sith DON'T deal with all of the force, that's kindof the point.  There are Force users that deal with both sides, but they act more like Qui-Gon Jinn instead of the Sith or the Counsel.  Instead of using the lore that was expanded upon *officially* through his company, he decided to give us..... this.  

The worst part is that he decided to fiddle around with his original works and it felt like he tried to wipe his original works out from existence.  That part angered a lot of people.

One thing I do like that came from this trilogy, is there was an expansion to the Mandalorians, even if the Clone Wars tv show changed them drastically (in a negative way in my opinion) and Disney said that was all a lie.

You're right to say that if he wanted to make this series just a slow pan around his face, then that was his right as a creator.  Just like it is our right as consumers to call him out on it.

I agree with one thing, people just didn't care enough. To me though, it seems like this universe was starting to find it's feet but the people that Disney thought were their target market just didn't appreciate them enough. Disney, as usual, are going to overreact to another situation (James Gunn) when it doesn't have to.

For example, the scene in Empire when Luke first meets Yoda....at first he's a bit crazy....he's giggling, he's messing with R2, he's telling Luke mindless riddles....but then AS SOON as Yoda chooses to reveal his true identity to young Luke and he turns to face him, you can just FEEL the transformation as you see him go from the goofy little alien to the wise and noble Jedi once again.

"Great review. There is one more really big thing, that shows us, how deeply good and kind Po is. He really tried to explain to Tai Lung, that there is no secret ingredient. And in that scene we can see different paths taken by characters. And all their fight is about being in peace with yourself and the rest of the world. Po didn't get hurt not only for the sake of comedy, but also because he represents unity with nature. Tai Lung contradicts nature, and seeks power in self confidence and physical strength. So for him this scroll is magical and he refuses to understand Po, when panda very kindly tries to help him.
Furthermore a liked how this film talks about kung fu. Since kung fu is not about martial arts, but is about giving effort and getting good at what you do, we can understand something. Shifu DIDN'T teach Po completly new fighting style or something. He teached Po to use skills that Po already had. So that training montage completly justified and realy could be completed in just one day. And when Po realised how to deal with world in harmony, he became much stronger, than Tai Lung.

"3:47 ...I never noticed that, but you're absolutely right. You can practically SEE him quick thinking on how to handle this without hurting them, and he pretty clearly deflects the curses towards each separate twin. SMART.

Also slight addendum to the Snape discussion: yes, what he did is impressive and he is a hero in the series. But you also have to keep in mind that he was also a villain--he was the one who Voldemort about the prophecy in the first place and when Voldy thought it was about Lily Snape begged him to spare her (but was fine with her husband and child being murdered.) That's... that's pretty bad. Snape only changed sides completely when she was killed as well and he was racked with torment for having caused the death of ""his love."" From then on he certainly does a lot of personal sacrifice and protecting Harry's life but I don't think we should so easily overlook that past action. He was accessory to baby murder. Maybe other murders as well, the man WAS a death eater in the close circle of Voldemort at full power after all!

But in a way that's what I love most about the character. He's not just ""good"" or ""bad"", he's a mix of both. He gives his life to a noble cause but carries bitter grudges that he can't surpress and lets them get in the way OF said cause. Snape is many things---but he certainly isn't one note.",0,0,2018-10-15T03:48:44.000Z,carlotta4th,UCXTV8iS59xJSf8sxCBhfNAQ,9-MNS7aE_dU,True,UgzFVcmFKuiyD2-Qe1l4AaABAg

"I like the way color is used in a subtle but creative way to indicate transformations in the characters. Violet for example.....when we first meet Violet, she is wearing very dark colors. Her long, black hair is hanging over her face and she is very shy and introverted....her voice is barely a whisper....and she doesn't have much confidence and that shows in her powers. Her dark clothing and hair are literally shielding her and she's better at disappearing because she is shy and wants to be invisible and she is very weak when it comes to her force fields....that is why she couldn't create one when her mom told her to when their plane was attacked. When she is outside the cave with her mother and Helen is encouraging her, we see the first hint of Violet coming out of her shell when Helen tucks her hair behind her ear, but she's not quite there yet because the mask comes on....but we do see her making small force fields with the fire. When they have to save their parents and her brother, we see Violet really start to shine. Her hair is pulled back, she is more confident in her powers and she is stronger and more assertive. SHE saves them from Syndrome's shackles. SHE figures out the remote controls the robot. Then at the end, when she is talking to the boy, we see her complete her transformation. Her hair is back, SHE is the one initiating the date plans with the boy (whereas before when she say him she was literally a shrinking Violet)  and she is wearing a bright pink top. The same can be said for Mr. Incredible. When we see him in his prime, he is the strong, handsome superhero that everybody adores. When the Supers are forced to retire and we get the time jump, we see Bob in a much different light. He is wearing very drab colors, he is fat, his hair looks a bit gray and he literally does not fit in the new work space that he finds himself in.. He's let himself go, and he's very grumpy and the only time he really lights up is when he's talking about being a superhero....as with his son and when he and Frozone are moonlighting hero work. When he first meets Mirage, he is still fat and the suit doesn't fit anymore and he has trouble doing hero work....he wins, but its definitely a struggle.....but then we see Bob transform back into Mr. Incredible....he gets his super physique back, he gets the new suit from Edna, he is more confident....he's spending time with his family and actually enjoying it. but it is only when his family comes to save him and rallies around him to defeat Syndrome that he truly becomes Mr. Incredible again....up until then, he was only doing it because he was terrified of losing them.",0,0,2018-10-15T02:07:32.000Z,CeltycSparrow,UC_sIPGNFeQQIjgAPiy3xZgw,vT47jdPXDFA,True,UgzVd5LcMRWACLHXb7d4AaABAg

"I agree with almost all of this. It was pretty clear that Tony had to survive for the 1 in a gazillion chance of success to work. And yeah - Tony's going to make that ultimate sacrifice. It ties so much into his vision from Age of Ultron, of him doing anything to make sure his friends don't die.

I believe Vision will be back, too, but I think it will be because of Shuri. She had completely scanned him and already knew a better way for his neural network to work. He was made from vibranium, and she already has a whole lab to rebuild people. She may even bring him back in the first part of Avengers 4, too, knowing they'd need him, maybe even as a way to track our heroes in the ""Soul Stone World"", given his unbreakable bond with Wanda.

"Also I could totally study the visuals and colors in this movie. And I have. 😆 And I can safely say the battle between Shifu and Tai Lung is my favorite animated - possibly overall - movie scene in existence. I've never had a scene invoke such a variety of emotions at once. :D It's epic, scary, and also quite heartbreaking in context. And Shifu totally gets the win for self sacrifice. He knew he couldn't defeat Tai Lung on account that he knew he couldn't kill who was once his son. And yet he knew that Tai Lung would most likely not return that restraint. Shifu hesitated fighting him once, and Tai Lung seriously injured him (which I have to give a personal win to future movies for including Shifu's limp from this.)

What I love above the final fight is it is not about Po beating up Tai Lung. Yes he is hurting him at times but really Po is defeating him by denying him what he wants and Tao Lung pretty much defeating himself. Tai Lung is muscling his way through everything and Po doing everything to deny and make everything Tao Lung does almost backfire. You can hear it as the fight drags on into the village; Tao Lung is getting exhausted both physically and mentally.

"Fun facterino: the whole concept of setting a prophecy in motion by trying to stop it from happening is as old as the tale of king Oedipus. Because of the prophecy that his son will kill him and marry his own mother the King sends his son Oedipus to die as an infant and so sets the prophecy in motion. Oedipus is saved, raised by humble workers and in a dispute kills the King (his father) unknowing of his position as royalty, frees the city of the sphinx and marries the queen (his mother)

The question stands: if the prophecy would've been ignored, would it still have happened or do we give it it's power by believing in it?

"I always felt that the most underlooked thing in Kung Fu Panda is that Po is as wrong as Shifu is, Shifu's mentality isn't the only thing getting in the way of Po being trained, its also Po himself. No matter how much abuse and training he is willing to go through, he can't succeed because his mindset isn't correct. 

""Yeah whenever you hit me, or called me fat, it hurt sure... but it could never hurt as much as just living my life being me. If there was anyone who could make me... NOT me, it would be you! The greatest Kung Fu master in all of China!""

Po's entire goal in pursuing kung fu is to become a different person entirely,  because despite the goofy-never-give-up attitude he really does hate himself in this film, and the scroll and the ""secret ingredient"" go out of their way to perfectly frame this change in his mentality.

For Shifu's fight, it's serious, fast paced, and stays somewhat grounded in reality.

-rey have no secret ingredients to be able to use the force 
-who is his real dad is not important 
-there is some great fightning moments
-it have a pretty philosophical deepth
-it is fun and have slapsticks , comic of situation humor and straight up hilarious dialogues
-there is a guy name poe in the two movies
-there is a profound message we're taugh that true kung-the forcefu power come from self-confidence and your innate strength
-luke refuse to train rey (shifu refuse to train po)
-luke (shifu) have train apprentices but his most powerfull one turned evil and so he never took another apprentice
-we discover in the movie that even your idols can have flaws , and weaknesses , that is why they are humans , as po discover that his idols the 5 legends are normal person , and has Rey discover with his idol luke.
-the shots are really beautiful with a preminence of stylized redish tones.
-Luke (shifu) forgive himself to have raise an apprentice which have fall into the dark side , at the end he is at peace
-the grand master die in a really poetical way , at peace and because he chose to become one with the world. He also refuse to do the same thing he did once (stop the empire) and Oogway refuse to stop taï-lung once again . eventhough he clearly could have do it , because he believe in his succesor and he know she can do it and follow his own path",10,1,2018-10-14T19:48:34.000Z,paul position,UCDwMnzKejgsLb4__vggaSsg,nPsWI6c5ayI,True,UgzDayGUmg14R2y4wgF4AaABAg

"Man, how do I sum up how I feel about this channel in a YouTube comment? First of all, thank you for making all this great content. It must be an insane amount of work, but your enthusiasm shines through every moment. Second, thanks for being relentlessly positive. At first, the curmudgeon in me thought that it was ""bad taste"" to be so positive about movies that are ""clearly bad"". But, I realized that 1) I hadn't even seen most of the movies I prejudged as ""bad"", and 2) even movies I dislike have a lot of redeeming qualities I overlook because It doesn't support my belief that the movie is bad. So in other words, thanks for being an antidote to the near-universal negativity in the Youtube-critique-osphere (I have no idea what to call it.) It's refreshing for so many reasons, but primarily because its a reminder to invest in what makes you happy. It's easy to get caught up in cynicism and judgement, but that's such a low-hanging fruit. It's more challenging, but so much more rewarding to look at things with a positive mindset, and to follow that feeling wherever it leads. I loved animation as a kid because it filled me with pure joy to see drawings come to life, and that is still a huge part of me. This video reminded me of that feeling.

"One of my absolute favorite movies of all time. I'm just gonna go ahead and add some of my own wins, simply because i love it so much!:

-Both Tigress and Tai Lung have glowing orange eyes, while their fellow non-feline animals do not ( 3:45 and 5:02 ). It's a little detail, but it makes so much sense. I especially adore how intense Tigress' orange eyes are in the blue darkness.

-Speaking of blue and orange, this movie is filled to the brim with great color theory. 12:23 is probably my favorite shot, the blue of Po's shadow blending into the blue of the pool, but also the blue details on the floor and the gold dragon in the water balancing the shot, leaving the whole background just 2 colors. The same thing happening at 12:17, with the details in the floor in the shadows looking gold, and the ones in the light looking blue.

-No seriously, there is so many scenes with contrasting colors in this movie it drives me nuts. 6:30 The green of Oogway and the ground with the pinks of the tree and fruit, 7:02 the purple darkness and the yellow of the candles and Oogways power, 10:38 with the purple-ish of the interior and the yellow glow of dawn, purple and gold again at 15:20... Also 4:34 with the almost-black and red, even if they're ""true"" contrasting colors, it's just too good not to mention! I'm serious, every shot of this movie is a masterpiece in color theory. There is very few moments where you can't find one warm color and one cool color in every scene.

-Shifu's ears at 15:21. It's such a cute little detail, the way they twitch and swivel around. There is not a lot of scenes where the characters get to act animal, but that is one of them. 7:40 too, with Tigress' pupils dilating and then her landing on all four.

What I'm saying is, I don't blame you for wanting to see this movie again rather than go to lunch with your wife. It's just so, so, sooo good.",94,0,2018-10-14T19:04:56.000Z,Pyromncer,UCOxlDqE10LhnVseMMiW-TJg,nPsWI6c5ayI,True,UgwdGUo0CKWtlsuZhzF4AaABAg

"As someone who does study Kung Fu (or at least, most forms of Kung Fu, it's difficult to study ALL of them), and has for years, this movie is quite accurate to Kung Fu philosophy. My Sifus had insisted that I watch it for years and I thought it was just another silly children's movie, but once I took the time to actually sit down and watch it, I realized that it really did hold a lot of the philosophies that we study. It also made me happy to see the main Kung Fu animal forms actually in animal form lol note, pandas are not one of them. A big thing about Kung Fu is that, it's based on the principle of man-imitate-animal, hence why animals are the focus and the true masters, but there really isn't much to admire about pandas in combat (though, they are very cute), which is why they're a big part of Chinese history, but you never will hear of ""panda form"" Kung Fu, which is exactly why this movie is so profound. They took something that would otherwise be entirely asinine and turned it into something inspiring. It only becomes more profound when you realize that red pandas aren't seen as Kung Fu masters either, so really, it's perfect poetic justice.",0,0,2018-10-14T18:22:22.000Z,Fullmetal1890P,UC8_q20AbabaHC_sH-JoZPHQ,nPsWI6c5ayI,True,UgxuEPWRhodIeXLKVBB4AaABAg

"Okay so Ive been meaning to ask this for a long time but I’ve never got up the nerve- could you take a look my favourite (also Dreamworks) movie? Rise of the Guardians. So many people turned away from it because of the gimmicky concept (myself included at first), but after watching it... well even years later it still holds dear to me as my favourite film and one that has almost defined my young adult years. It reminded me of my inner child at a time when I needed it most, and made me feel what the characters were feeling. As someone with autism, empathy is something I’ve always struggled with and yet this film managed to make me feel for the main character in a way I struggle to with most real people. I understand you’re very busy but if you could consider choosing it as something to get round to eventually I’d really appreciate it.

"Ahhh I’m so glad your reviewing this! I love love LOVE the kung fu panda serious! My favorite has the be the second movie out all the ones that are out so far. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and as an artist and hopefully a soon to be animator in the future, it’s inspiring and absolutely nut worthy. the story of po’s true origins as well as the trauma and heart break that not only he has to suffer from but as well as his loved one? Absolutely heart breaking. And the villain? My god he has the be my favorite next to tai lung. He literally radiates such a sinister energy, I wish more villains were like him tbh.  And my favorite has to be the fighting scenes. Why?  It’s not only because they are well animated as well as beautifully choreographed, I just adore how the furious five incorporated po into their fighting style, like it really amazing how they’ve adapted everything for his style and way of fighting to fit in with theirs, making them an almost unstoppable team. A great example for that would have to be the first fight they have in the beginning of the movie. I was actually quite mad I didn’t see a lot of people noticing this or pointing it out. I guess I want looking in the wrong places lmao. Anyway I’m fangirling too hard.

"I'm 24 now and only recently I appricate how amazing this film is from the stunning animation of the Kung fu to the voice acting. However my most important part of the film is the moral, you just have to believe it to appreciate it, which I think is pretty important no matter what your age is. 
Also ' the past is History, Tomorrow is a Mystery and today is a gift, that's why they call it the present' there is no better way to say this as I know I've heard it before is other ways. This film is timeless in it's teachings and forever be one of my favourites

"I usually don't argue against any of cinemawins's... well... 'wins'... But about the part at 4:00 with why the Joker was depressed. The problem is that... The Joker doesn't love Harley. That's kind of the whole point about their relationship. That the Joker would let Harley die without a second thought. He'd definitely not contemplate suicide from thinking he'd lost her, he'd probably not be more upset about it than you are remembering back to the one toy you had as a kid that was kind of fun and that broke/got lost at some point. Jared Leto does a good performance and is an interesting character (I suppose), but he isn't a good Joker. At least not accurate. You could argue that accuracy to the comics doesn't matter, hell, the MCU breaks comic book canon all the time. But the fact that the Joker doesn't love Harley is literally the defining point of their toxic relationship. Making a Joker that loves Harley, and would become depressed over the concept of loosing her, is misunderstanding their entire relationship dynamic. It's also a bit dangerous, the Joker is an abuser, he abuses Harley, there is literally 0 doubt about that. Painting their relationship as a loving relationship in this movie sends a wrong message. Btw, I did mention that specific win, but it really goes for everything with the Joker and Harley's relationship in this movie, the joker does *not* love Harley, he would not go through all of this to get her. He'd probably get her back eventually, as she's a fun toy to have around and can be useful, but he wouldn't be so motivated and go through so much effort so quickly and desperately.",0,0,2018-10-14T17:57:16.000Z,Monika,UCKQJm9bAnFJXi61gnLDinTQ,U2TRItGklnQ,True,UgzX7xHYHxoCxkVpjvR4AaABAg

"I know this was posted and made years ago, and that you're probably not going to read this, but there is something that I felt the need to say.

Your opinion of The Comedian is slightly skewed, at least in my opinion.  He's like the inverse of Batman, he's not the hero we (at least the US population in Watchmen) need, he's the hero we deserve and the hero we wanted.  He was exactly what we wanted, and lived up to the expectations.  He burned people alive and lit his cigar with the flames because that's what we expect out of our action heroes, he killed a pregnant woman who slightly wounded him because the USA doesn't take any slight and reacts with excessive force regardless of who caused it, and the 'rape' scene which is what I had the most disagreement with.

I didn't really understand that whole thing until I saw the movie, and thought the same way you did until I could see the exact timing of the speech and the visuals.  I'm convinced that they were having an affair, and she liked it REALLY rough.  Something that her husband couldn't provide, but The Comedian could.  Him saying ""You get off on this."" and her smirk as she's laying there, and the timing on all of it is what convinces me.  With that change in view, it puts everything else in a slightly different perspective.  It's him taking the label of rapist in order to protect her image.

With how he treats his daughter, combined with his breakdown on finding out Azo's plan, it shows (at least for me) that he's not someone who enjoys this type of thing, but does keep up a front for most of it because it's what's expected of him.  He thinks (either rightly or wrongly) that they want a leashed anti-hero working for their government.  Someone who will rain down hellfire upon their enemies, but is blase about it.  He's willing to give up his reputation, and even his humanity, to do what is expected and wanted from him.  His mask slips sometimes, but because of the persona, he can just laugh it off because of 'the joke'.",0,0,2018-10-14T16:41:13.000Z,Lead Paintchips,UCpB7p_aDEcxzPkWeW6BLB_w,4x9mSNw_TrI,True,UgzvagYx1-8JBlElc6Z4AaABAg

"So, there's a theory that even though Thanos is able to use the Time Stone with the other infinity Stones and erase half the universe, he doesn't actually have it for the sole reason that the Time Stone appears to utilize Strange's time dilation spell, which none of the other stones do for any reason!

And there's yet another theory that everyone who got erased is actually in the soul stone (much like Gamora's inner child is also in there and can regularly speak with Thanos).

"most people hate the mandarin twist and the villain. but for me killian was great and that twist had a huge part on to make him even greater. 
people says ''his motivation was weak he just dumped by tony and get ready to kill himself''. when we first saw him, his character was obviously a loser and we can see that even before tony, nobody gave a damn about him for his whole life and plus he was crippled. and this kind of thinks can easily push people to the dark ways. personally i found his motivation uniqe because most villains motivations being like ''i want revenge and nothing else matter'' or ''im gonna do all this bad things for greater good''. now these are good too but killian's actions show how human beings can be so sensitive and unstable even agains the most simple psychological wounds. just like electro from TASM 2 they didnt use one big motivation but a lot of little motivation.

and this twist was brilliant because it show us how he got from 0 to 100 by using his own insignificance Instead of letting it kill himself. a little-known comic book villain use a well known archenemy's name for bait people and when people look another way he risen and he was about to take the position of the most powerful man in the world

also I'm glad there's no Mandarin in this movie. because first of all they have to give him those alien tech rings and they have to make relatable story for them.
second i prefer more modern  designed mandarin. just like the mandarin from iron man armored adventures. not some fire-lord ozai looking guy",0,0,2018-10-14T02:35:44.000Z,Baris Bal,UCqUwtoVHUyRhAR30ave5piA,CgRI15iKcRQ,True,Ugxw6NXHF8Cazu5NpgZ4AaABAg

In the first movie only Alan and Sarah retain their memories when time is rewound and none of the damage caused by the game is left. This gives them both the chance to have a lasting impact over their lives and the lives of others, namely saving Peter and Judy's parents. In the second movie all the kids are released after the win and placed back into the moment they were taken by the game but retain their memories.

"Everyone's read the Ring Theory by now but it does make me see the prequels in a new light: there is definitely artistic and storytelling merit in them even if they fall flat in terms of scripting and performance (and they really, really do) at times. But when you look into how deeply Lucas connected them to their matching film in the original trilogy it actually boggles the mind a bit. The most amazing example in this film is the wonderful and triumphant score at the end before the credits roll being a note-for-note rework of the Emperor's theme for ROTJ, only just obviously completely different in tone. It's one of my favourite pieces of music in all of Star Wars and yet when you hear the Emperor's theme not only is it obvious that they're the same, but that piece is horribly creepy and ominous. That's some serious design going on there, and it pervades every aspect of the prequel trilogy. If only Lucas ceded directorial control like he did in the OT, or at least let a ruthless editor touch up his scripts, they would've been truly brilliant. As it is, I enjoy them a lot, but there is a small but significant amount of cringe involved in watching them now I'm not 11 and just stoked for a new Star Wars film (even though I totally am whenever one comes out).",0,0,2018-10-13T19:23:30.000Z,Samuel Honywill,UCNVjxK_IOUkMkXpDPmGw14A,QppINK042N8,True,Ugxe8OKJCO-CQ-_-1dB4AaABAg

"I think you’re wrong when you say Thanks doesn’t love Gamora. You say that it is simply respect. But it grew to more than that. The same way a step parent eventually learns to care about a child as their own, Thanos grew to love Gamora and Nebula. Just because their relationship doesn’t seem like something that you would consider love doesn’t mean it isn’t love. Also, the reason he kills her is because it highlights that he is so committed to his purpose, and he believes so much in what he is doing that he is willing to sacrifice everything. He does love Gamora. But he is willing to trade one life to save millions. Doesn’t matter that he threw her over a cliff. Thanos loves Gamora. Simple as that.

"Solo was stupid in soooo many ways.
1) There are a trilogy of books that spells out his origin much, much better. And ok, sure, a *trilogy* of books can go into much deeper into detail than a single movie. Ok, I'll give you that one. 
2) It explains Han's last name as ""Solo"" as being a family name, instead of that bullshit in this movie. Seriously, what the FUCK was that??
3) Han got the Falcon from a game of Pazak that Lando threw. See, he was down in the dirt and Lando said ""Beat the tournament I'm hosting, and I'll give you 'any ship on my lot'"", meaning the fleet he had for sale. Han, being the clever smuggler he is, took the bait and beat Lando. Then claimed the Falcon. Lando tried to stop Han, but, as Han points out, Lando said ""Any ship on my lot"", and the Falcon was on Lando's lot.
4) The reason Han doesn't trust everyone is because a) Han idolized the Empire, and joined to be a pilot, and was one of the best pilots in the fleet. He then saw what the Empire did to... basically everyone, and since he is against slavery, he saves a Wookie (Chewie) who swore a Wookie Life Debt to him. And b) Han had a girlfriend. Tria, I believe her name was. She actually left him one morning since he wouldn't join the Rebellion, and with her leaving him, and knowing how the Empire truly is, and... literally everything else that happened that I can't mention here, cause it's a LOT, he was scorned one too many times.
5) Han did NOT lie about completing the Kessel Run in under 12 parsecs. The Kessel Run is a smuggler's route that goes by a cluster of black holes. Some small, some large, some huge. Since the Falcon was the fastest ship in the galaxy at the time, couple that with Han and Chewie's skills as pilots, he and Chewie were able to use both the Falcon and the wonky, spacetime muddling effects of black holes to make a trip of (if I'm remembering correctly) an average of 15 Parsecs, based on who's making the run, in under 12. He shortened the distance by flying closer to the black holes than any other pilot would dare, and closer than any other ship in the galaxy could physically do, because the Falcon is (Was, now) the fastest ship in the galaxy, able to outpace anything in the Empire's fleets. This is, again, explained in the trio of books.


Honestly, there's so much wrong with the movie.... I could write a college thesis on it. I've already written enough for a fucking high-school paper. Fuck Kathleen Kennedy, fuck Disney, and fuck what Star Wars has become. The Prequels were bad enough, but Jesus, Buddha, Ra and Odin, Episode 8 and Solo are piles of steaming garbage. It's not the casts' fault. I understand that. They had to work with the script. I don't blame them. I blame Disney and Kathleen Kennedy. I blame the SJWs and the choices companies are making to pander to the minority groups. (The feminazis, not minorities like the blacks or Asians). Fuck all of those people. I mean no ill will towards the cast, unless they had a part in making the recent movies the piles of hot garbage they are, in which case, fuck them too. But ONLY if they had a hand in it. 

I mean, for fuck's sake, Luke Skywalker himself is disgusted with The Last Jedi. Do you know how bad a movie has to be for one of your iconic characters to hate it? I'll tell you how bad: Independence Day 2, and Star Wars: Episode 8 level of bad.",1,1,2018-10-13T11:07:49.000Z,Austin Jurgle,UC7dIRgobjM25QsIFJ5Ln7rQ,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgyD7Sb6Bq7HCcLuPhZ4AaABAg

"Finally, a POSITIVE review on the Phantom Menace. Yes it does have its flaws, but I still enjoy it. Heck, I still really love Attack of the Clones because that was the movie that really brought me into Star Wars. In fact, it is the sequel trilogy movies, the ones that aren't being made by Lucas, that deserve more hate than this film. Granted, they are still relatively good movies, but they don't have the same good story writing as Lucas. Occasionally, they can make something good, like Rogue One, Solo, and the TV shows. However, the sequels are the movies that fall flat on their faces, and part of the reason might be the fact that they don't have as good screen writers as Lucas.



Also, something that I absolutely HAVE to say regarding The Phantom Menace: LAY OFF JACOB LLOYD!! Sure, he may not have been the best actor, but then again, he was nine. Good child actors are hard to come by, although some like Shirley Temple can still become phenomenal actors. However, he does not warrant all the hate surrounding him. Because of the movie's failure at the box office and all the hate from the movie, Lloyd was severely bullied in school, quit acting altogether shortly afterwards, and ended up in a mental institution because of all the hate and bullying he was receiving. And yet, there are still people who frequently bad-mouth him for his performance in the movie. Hasn't he suffered enough? 
For all the Jacob Lloyd haters out there: look at yourselves. Look at what this hatred has done to this poor kid. It didn't just destroy his acting career, it destroyed his life. Can you live with yourselves, knowing that people like you have either directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally, caused all this psychological trauma to this poor kid? Can you really blame an actor for bad screenwriting, especially a child? How would you like it if you were in his position? If you don't like his acting, then that's fine, its your opinion, and I'm not going to trample on it. But DEATH THREATS? BULLYING? All this RAGE and animosity to what I must admit is a mediocre actor? PEOPLE!! That's too far. Sure, he may not be the best, but he doesn't deserve this. There are WAY worse actors out there, but even then, they don't deserve this. No one does. If you are the kind of person who would hate someone so much that you would publicly berate him, bully him, spread forth toxic animosity and rage, or even go so far as to make death threats, then you are no better than those occasional Reddit chat-flamers that would unapologetically drive a person to committing suicide. Heck, with all the hatred surrounding Lloyd and his current mental state, it might actually get to that point. So, if you are one of those die-hard devoted haters of Jacob Lloyd out there, please stop it. 
Again, I'm only calling out the people who absolutely hate this guy, and would actually go so far as to do some of the things I've mentioned. If you just don't like his acting, or do hate him, but don't go so far as to attack him personally, directly or indirectly, or if you are the kind of person who doesn't really mind or care about his acting, or actually find him descent, then this doesn't apply to you. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but there is a fine line between opinion and harassment, and in the case of the backlash against Jacob Lloyd, it certainly has crossed the line. 

I will defend him whenever possible, because no one deserves to go through what he has gone through. People must understand that actors are people too, and that they do go through similar challenges in life. The fact that they're famous makes their lives even more difficult, especially if that person has a lot of hatred against him. If we let our personal aggression get the better of us, especially at the levels we see with Jacob Lloyd, then we risk becoming like barbaric animals, becoming even worse than the person the hate is directed to. We're not animals, we're human beings. Act like it.

Thanks again for such a wonderful video. Its good to see a positive review on this movie for once, and it really is quite refreshing. Screw the haters. There are WAY worse movies out there (the holiday special anyone?) that deserve more hate than this does. As a sequel, its not the best. As a movie, its still pretty good. After all, its Star Wars.

"Another win! It's no big deal, but to say that Chadwick Boseman is the best casting decision since RDJ may be a bit of an exaggeration. To be sure, Boseman is an amazing Black Panther. From his accent, to his build, to his mannerisms, he totally brings the character to life. Marvel has done an amazing job with casting all along, though. Who better to be Captain America than Chris Evans? I really can't imagine another person. And as for Thor, well, SNL once made a joke about a casting agent saying that they wanted someone to audition who can inhabit the hero, but they didn't expect ""Actual Thor"". That's how perfect Hemsworth is as the Asgardian. Even Tom Holland is as close to an ideal Spider-man as you're going to find. That's to say nothing of Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Rudd, Tom Hiddleston,and even the happy surprise of Dave Bautista. The MCU has so clearly outdone DC (WB), Fox, and Sony in this regard that I'd be shocked to see another cinematic universe's casting come close to Marvel Studios in our lifetime.

"IMHO, the trilogy starts in the wrong place and ends in the wrong place. Clones should have been the first film...it's a great place to start the story, and a great rationale for Anakin and Padme to meet and fall in love.  ""Here, protect this senator."" ""Wow, sure!""  Nothing happens in TPM that anybody needed to see.

Sith is a perfect second film because it ends on such a dark note.  But then we need a third film, and that film could solve a number of major problems with the trilogy.  How is Ben so certain that Vader can never be turned? I almost get the impression that he's tried at least once...and that would be a perfect plot for the third film. We could also spend more time on the hunting down of the Jedi, because 'Order 66' always seemed far too contrived and easy for my taste. We could ditch the silly death of Padme in childbirth, which was always contradicted by Leia's memories anyway, and have her and Ben try to turn Vader together.  Vader not only kills Padme, but his own infant son Luke as well...except the infant Vader kills is actually Owen and Beru's, switched by Ben to fool Vader.  Which would explain why Owen seemed to have a lot of suppressed anger towards both Luke and Ben in ANH. 

Meanwhile, Yoda's exile on Dagobah has never made a lick of sense. He came this close to beating Palpatine, why not try again? Why exile himself and let Palpatine have free reign?  In a third movie, Yoda could once more attack Palpatine. They crash land together on Dagobah, their duel is the cause of the darkness in the cave, and when Palpatine wins and believes Yoda dead, he simply leaves the planet leaving Yoda stranded.  Ben has no idea Yoda is alive, until he dies himself. 

Meanwhile, the third film could also flesh out the origins of the Rebellion.  What if, instead of killing Grievous, the leader of the Separatist armies, the third film sees Padme and Bail Organa seeking out Grievous to unite the remnants of the Separatists with the loyal forces of the Republic in some sort of...Alliance of Rebels?  

Hell, if it had been me, I wouldn't have made Grievous a droid, but a guy in an exo-suit.  And the guy in the exo-suit?  A TEENAGE MON MOTHMA!

"While this movie has a different feel than Jurassic park, it is a new series within a series.  I still get nostalgic whenever “Rexie” shows up adorned by the signature JW score titled as both “The park is closed” and “Nine to survival job” from the OST.  I admit I get a lump in my throat when I think how she is still going after 22 years of not seeing her since the first movie 1993’-2015’.  I do miss the CGI from the first two films, but the new stuff has grown on me a bit.  The progressive use of animatronics and other practical effects makes it easier to live with.  Even in parts of  Jurassic World, when the Indominous Rex is moving slowly, such as when it kneels down to sniff out Owen after eating the two park workers, and you can see only its jaws, or the end scene where It’s snout emerges outside the souvenir stand and Claire tosses the flare at it and it growls, it has some level of solidity when it was really cgi.  While ILM did a nice job with practical effects in Fallen Kingdom, I think it would be really cool if Universal hired grad students from the Stan Winston school of effects as an internship to work on the next film.  That was a huge piece of Stan Winston’s legacy in those first two JP movies,  and now the students whom are studying the art of practical effects.
  Jurassic World was, for me the first movie to bring Nick Robinson to my attention, since I never saw Kings of summer or Melissa and Joey, so for me, he is Zach Mitchel and Simon Spear.  When I see his character In Jurassic World say something sweet, which was rare for his character, I follow it by saying “Love, Simon.”  If anyone hasn’t seen “Love Simon”, it’s a sweet, heartfelt movie.  And unlike his character in Jurassic World, Simon Spear is such a lovable character, and very relatable.",0,0,2018-10-12T15:25:16.000Z,sidewaysonhighways,UCjyUuoL0STT9clPpN0zGXww,sjvcjg1QBSM,True,Ugxx2mtgBdZJy2UDyuZ4AaABAg

"Well the ""Ghost in the Shell"" feel from Enfys Nest theme is easily explainable as it basically hits the same marks: the instrumentation is epic, but tuned down, and based around percussive and high-pitched sounds, while a dissonant chorus sounds over the theme, creating a sense of grandeur and scale. It's probably a conscious homage to the score of Ghost in the Shell, and I'd say it's a good one at that. It works flawlessly with the scene, and ads a sense of scale that would probably have not been accomplished by other means.

It is one of the best things in the movie, however. That and, probably (as unpopular as my opinion might be),  Alden Ehrenreich's portrayal of a young Han Solo. The smirks and stuttering were spot on, and I'd say he did a good job in adapting Harrison Ford's early career's mannerisms into his performance.

The story beats, however, were quite a bit off. Too much humour and not enough epicness if you ask me. Some of the deaths were too predictable and lacked the weigh they were supposed to have. And the last cameo by Maul has no sense at all. I blame the script more than the direction itself, but we all know how much of a mess this movie was.

Emilia Clarke's performance as Qi'Ra, and the design of Chewbacca were quite off, too. She seemed quite out of place, and not having clear what she was going for with the character. Chewbacca, on the other hand (I might be wrong about this) seemed like a brutish beast some times, and a smart companion some other times. Overall, it added up to a confusing character. Plus, his design was a bit too lean in my opinion. I would have liked to see him a bit heavier and more imposing.

Overall the movie was average to me. More or less equal in quality to Rogue One, a bit over the new trilogy (which was not bad, of course, just... could be improved), and of course light years below the original trilogy (we don't talk about the prequels here...)

PS: I'd make an exception in Paul Bettany's performance (quite good, in my opinion... menacing but calm, with a character design that mixed perfectly a sense of oppulence with a dangerous lifestyle), and Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Tobias Beckett: a great mentor figure, I believe, and his betrayal was a bit unexpected to me. I would have voted for Qi'Ra betraying Solo before him doing it. Also, his death was one of the heaviest and most emotional ones in the movie.",0,0,2018-10-12T12:54:34.000Z,Ever Wanderer,UCTNgYEymBCWp31feC9uGPVQ,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgxyC8I-ZGLzBKr3GhV4AaABAg

As such I don't watch trailers for movies I know I'll see. Yes Solo won't go down as the greatest Star Wars movie of all time but I went into the cinema with no idea what I'd get and I got a fun swashbuckler movie.

I will say that I actually did have an expectation which was that it would be an origin story and it kinda was but we really didn't see Han become the Han from New Hope. I suppose they were counting on telling that story over several movies and I'm actually on with that.

"Ok I didn't hate BvS as much as the next guy. I thought that most of the stuff leading up to the fight between the two was pretty good. I loved the Bruce Wayne perspective on the events of MoS. I actually, for the most part, liked Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, as it was interesting and engaging in a way a simple villain like Steppenwolf in Justice League wasn't. I thought most of the Batman nightmares were pretty damn awesome, and I loved Batfleck. I thought Diana, while I liked her in this, shouldn't have been in the movie as it was a bit distracting and didn't add much to what I thought was a complex enough plot already. I love Jeremy Irons as Alfred and I thought pretty much everything about Batman's tech was great. Overall, most of the tension building was great.

I thought some of the stuff (such as where the mercenaries kill people and it's somehow blamed on Superman) were...forced, but I'll let that be. I didn't think the weird Flash thing was necessary or needed.

While I understand your interpretation of the ""Martha"" scene, that scene just lost me. 95% of people who watched this said ""no that's just dumb"" and I'm inclined to agree. I'm ok with Superman not really trying to explain to Batman what the situation is, but surely there's a better way to get them to fight simply because they have too many differences to accept, a way that doesn't say ""screw the tension we've been building on Clark's side toward Batman for half the movie, we're just gonna kidnap his mother and force him into the fight."" I can't really say what they were going for, although I think your interpretation is a fairly good bet. If that was it though, there's a such thing as too subtle. The much more obvious conclusion is that this is just a dumb device and there isn't a way to sugarcoat this: it's bad writing. If the idea is to humanize Superman to Bruce, give more Clark in a different way and set the stage for that better. Maybe have Superman actually do something which Bruce disagrees with strongly and leads him to conclude that because he is basically an alien god, he must be destroyed. Emphasize that, not the ""he's a potential threat.""

I also felt like it should have ended there. I think a darker, more interesting way to have ended it would have been to have Bruce actually kill Clark, and in that last moment Clark is humanized in some way, perhaps by his mother. I thought the whole Doomsday thing was tacked on and honestly just annoyed me. So did the dirt rising off the coffin; nobody thinks he's going to stay dead, but pretend he will be and keep him dead for at least an entire movie (looking at you Justice League) so Bruce really appreciates the terrible thing he has done and the need for a Justice League is better realized.

Anyway, that's my two cents.",0,0,2018-10-12T03:15:08.000Z,Fa11,UCJlbwbpPlzprDnkjLNSqSxQ,Y5S7rjUbC14,True,Ugx_1PCAGO5lDTcSw2F4AaABAg

For a movie titled Tomorrowland, you would have thought more of it would have taken place ""in"" Tomorrowland.
The ingredients were there to make a great movie, and somehow, Disney fumbled this ball.
If she had been able to stay in Tomorrowland after her touring around it, the directions the movie could have
gone in, would have been fantastic.
Instead, we get teased with the possibility of it, turning into a moody, overdone message movie, primarily
concerned about getting back in.  And when they do, Tomorrowland is in hunkered down mode,
waiting for a storm on the horizon.
I'm not adverse to message movies but, it required a lighter touch, a bit more finesse.

"This video series reminded me how lucky I am to have lived when these movies came out. I enjoyed the action and special effects as a teenager when they first played, and now that I'm older (""only"" 28 but still), I am so drawn in by the acting, music, editing, set pieces, costumes etc. 
It's painfully obvious how little effort most modern blockbuster movies put into these aspects, and just paint it over with explosions and CGI to distract from how little emotion and character drive they actually have. I can't help but cry at the whole ending sequence with Sam joining Frodo on the boat and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli setting out to ""hunt some orc"". The interplay between the music and the imagery is what gets me especially - the leitmotifs and how they weave in and out and expand upon each other works to an insane degree and just overwhelms me every time. I will probably treasure this trilogy more and more with time, since the blockbuster CGI shitshow we have nowadays shows no sign of slowing down (an exception being Deadpool, because at least that movie is honest about how ridiculous it is - a little bit of self awareness goes a long way in making a ridiculous movie emotionally engaging).
Apologies to anyone who like the blockbuster movies, but this is honestly how I've felt about them for a number of years now. The difference between them and LOTR IMO is that LOTR contains a deeply emotional and character-driven core underneath all the action, whereas I have a hard time connecting to stories or characters in most newer movies. I laughed through most of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom for example - not to ridicule it, but because I honestly couldn't help it and didn't know how else to react.",0,0,2018-10-11T18:41:13.000Z,Malthe Vinther,UCtLC7OlPpNZDDzv3y2WOI6w,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgwYde37Ng9y7Pi23ox4AaABAg

"I often watch these videos to remind myself how much I love a movie or at least give myself at least 1 reason to not absolutely hate a film I personally disliked. As an aspiring film director for what seems like forever now I judge movies extremely harshly it seems and my favorite part is accenting what they managed to do right. 

Most of the times I'm either all for what CinemaWins is winning, unless its famous actresses or actors, the score for just being the score (like gaaaah I love scores for how they make you feel while watching it, the way it blends into the moment and enhancing what's on screen instead of sticking out to me as a good piece of music) and the lack of commentary of camera shots. 

So I came here with the intention of trying to make up my mind on The Good Dinosaur as I've been stuck on it for years and years. Like no matter what, hands down it will always be the gorgeous gorgeous animation that sticks out to me. But as a movie? I can't make a call for one way or another and I feel like CinemaWins couldn't either. 

And that sucks. You can't label it as mediocre and yet that's what always sticks out after a first time viewing. 

I think I've come to decide that it depends on how or where or why you watched this film that will ultimately decide it for you. 

I myself watched it with a group of my friends in highschool one late night and it culminated into a giant hug fest right in the middle of the movie where the toughest out of all us was in tears and calling us her family. 

And well... any movie that can encite those feelings in anybody has to be a win for me. 

(I also loved the whole, holy shit this movie is dark for kids movie. Cause movies aren't just for kids anymore and it's why when what's supposed to be colorful concept gets heavy in its emotions and environment that it truly brings out those sort of feelings that really inspire people. )

I honestly cant help but compare it to Lion King and so many others cant help it as well, but while the Lion King sticks out to us as making us laugh one minute and then brutally murdering our feelings the next, The Good Dinosaur seems more slice of life.  Getting those same feelings of love, loss, family and belonging across in a slower more realistic way. It's a movie meant to make you think on those concepts that was ultimately dragged down by the childish world they created. They had to have the Storm Chasers in there for plot and villiany tomfoolery and the T-rexes in there for a small relief from the journey, but imagine if they simply continued with their journey that entire time and Arlo just let his conscious be the driving factor of the plot. The writers show they are fucking outstanding at getting messages and feelings across without words and honestly simplistic, realistic images, that I'm almost positive they couldve made this movie revolutionary in the way that storyline would have been presented.",0,0,2018-10-11T07:53:34.000Z,Polar534,UCDwCIlJ74xqsrCpj05MG0lw,ddjHnBHBo8k,True,UgxY5a5LHKEcf-gqurt4AaABAg

"I feel like the theory of Sweetpea actually being the protagonist and Baby doll being sort of a reflection of herself or character in her head is completely accurate. The way Sweetpea narrates it instead of Babydoll, and especially the way we see her transition from baby doll to her in a wig during the first fantasy scene. It’s literally like she’s commenting on her own real life as if it’s a play that she’s performing. Also there’s a boy that we see only Sweetpea interact with, once in the real world and once in the WW2 fantasy, which should be enough to say it’s all her own fantasy, not Babydoll’s. When Babydoll sacrifices herself for Sweetpea’s freedom, it’s really Sweetpea sacrificing her body (represented by Babydoll) so that she can be “free” in her mind. She accepts her fate and her past and realizes the only way to truly be free is no one can control her mind. Hence why at the end when Babydoll is lobotomized (which is really Sweetpea) she really wins bc no matter what happens to her body she is free in her mind, which is why we see Sweetpea riding a train into the distance. That’s in her mind where she’s finally free.

The only thing that truly bothered me was the whole 12 parsecs thing. I always saw it as Han telling them how fast the ship really was. Before this I never heard about Lucas's explanation and I honestly never felt it needed one. When I saw the scene in theaters I was thoroughly disappointed because they basically said nope it's not the ship it's this special fuel. The fact that they took this awesome line and under cut it is what I dislike.,0,0,2018-10-10T21:58:48.000Z,Chancelor HIGGINS-GLOOR,UCUcP1qaCwaxJfjaRqVFCPIg,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgzSPq6i_y_PgYLpbHR4AaABAg

"Yes rey is a marry sue, there is absolutely nothing she struggles with through out the whole movie and anytime any new skill is presented in front of her she masters it instantly, on what is her first time flying a space ship she flies in a way comparable to what we saw a Anikin do, her first time handling a blaster the only time she messes up is a comic relief moment, it takes her only three tries to get he Jedi mind trick and we never even see her experiment with it or fail except for the first few times she tries it, she then beats Kylo ren and over powers him with the force on their first confrontation, without any sort of allusion to her being super powerful or anything. Through out the whole movie she displayed in instance of a character flaw which does not affect the plot later whatsoever, that being that she wants to go back to Jaku for like the first half of the movie and it’s not revisited at any point after that. There’s nothing she struggles with or overcomes in this movie or the even the last Jedi. While that doesn’t mean she ends up being a bumbling idiot like some other people say, it just ends up meaning her character just ends up meaning her characters decisions often have little to no impact and she just does stuff for the sake of doing it.

2. I find it hilarious how Human relations with Artificial Intelligence is nowhere NEAR a new thing and yet pairing a Female personality programmed Droid with Lando absolutely flipped the shit of many people. I can see it was worsened by the seeming ""SJW"" ideology that was given to L3 during a time where there's a giant social war going on over that, but when I listened to L3's dialogue I was hearing a Droid speaking out against legitimate treatment ""their kind"" is given, and you must remember the Droids in this universe are self aware, which makes them sentient and practically no different to Humanity, or any other Intelligent species in Star Wars.

"For all those of you out there, regardless if you liked the movie or not, the only reason the movie flopped was because Disney screwed with the main story line so they could push a silly, one-sided agenda. A problem with a lot of movies is trying to appeal to all audiences so they can make more money instead of staying true to the story. The reason why Rogue One is an awesome movie is they kept the right balance of new story mixed with old story and fan service. SW has, if not the biggest, then one of the biggest fan-bases of an movies. So if you alienate the fan base then you receive backlash like after ep 8.

"han shooting first, before being shown him NOT shooting first, is not rewarding. when did he learn this valuable lesson? from a ""pro tip"" from his new mentor? no. Han should have been put in a situation where he needed to shoot first, not shoot first, and suffer from it before gaining the insight to shoot first in the future.

han not winning the falcon just to give the plot a reason to bring lando along? bull shit. lando never should have gone on the trip to kessel. And, it's still his ship! having him agree to a lower cut when he's providing the thing the group needs to accomplish their mission is dumb. lando wouldnt go for that. at any point he could tell them to fuck off and ask han where's his new ship he just won.

Something else i wanted to see that was NOT shown, Han actually at the academy. not fighting as an imperial soldier. Also, perhaps show the han learning how to pilot, or are we all just okay with all new star wars character portrayals as never having earned their skills. this is an origin story, orgin stories that start with the protagonist having all their powers and abilities already is bad and lazy writing.

i think each character did the best they could with the script they were given. i dont dislike any of the actors performances... except for L3-37 (leet, really? leet is that droids name? AND NOBODY HAS SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT YET?)

"Solo's a fine movie that had the bad luck of being released with little fanfare when it wasn't anything people were clamoring for in the first place, way too soon after another main series Star Wars movie with a polarized reception, a week after Infinity War and a week before Deadpool 2. If they'd saved it for later in the year during that dry spell before Venom where there was NOTHING out that anybody wanted to see, it might not've made enough money to recoup the losses from the extensive reshoots that inflated its budget, but it probably would've made more money than it ended up making. I personally think it was way better than Rogue One. Rogue One was actually kinda boring and forgettable for the most part. Solo's character writing, performances, and character/costume design were way better, it was more fun and colorful, funny, charming, and I felt like it hit that sweet spot of feeling like the original trilogy without the plot being too derivative, and Alden Ehrenreich and Donald Glover knock it out of the park as young Han and Lando.",1,1,2018-10-10T03:04:40.000Z,EmeraldSpirals,UCuVK2TwWArmIcgssQv5X_oQ,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgzHg-JTxMKf7rEevd54AaABAg

"This was one of my ""Cinema Wins"" for the movie that took the third watch to notice. We're all used to Han Solo advancing a plan and people reacting in disbelief (and sometimes disgust). It seems like nobody ever really trusts that he can do what he says he can do. But when he told Chewie to drop the landing gear and Chewie growled back, his response was, ""When I tell you to."" So we can derive from his response that Chewie wasn't expressing disbelief or disgust... he was just asking for further information to do his part of the job correctly.

"Actually, I want to correct you on the issue people have with the final lightsaber duel. Before I start, I want to state that I do like this movie. I despise the original two prequels, but this movie feels like Star Wars and genuinely is a well made and directed film. Anyway, the issue with this final lightsaber duel is that it never feels like either of them are in danger. It’s all too fast paced and like a dance. There’s never a moment where one or either of the two are scared or worried. Never a moment where they may fail. Never a moment where there is fear in their faces or tiredness in their movements.

"I think the movie flopped because it aimed to please the ""true"" starwars fans.. you know, the old episodes 1-3 masterrace kind. But in the same breath the movie tried to sell us Han Solo. 

The collest kid on the block, the hero, the legend Han Solo. But to the new starwars fans Han Solo is propably not even that great.. Solo is the typical ""good guy/kinda hero"" older movies often tend to have. He is from a time where movies had The Good Guys and The Bad Guys and a clear line between them; but that is not what people today like to watch or experience in their movies, so ultimately Good Guy Mister Sunshine Han Solo is pretty boring.

 Dont get me wrong, i like starwars, but i am fan enough to see the issues and fan enough to admit flaws of the franchise.

Personally, whenever i see the episode 4-6 i cant help it but i have to cringe a awful lot of times, because it is very obvious that those movies were not made to become a major player, they did not set up enough lore and a deep world to make satisfying media. As i said, old movies often had this issue, but it feels very different and way more significant when you have a big franchise: Three full movies of (in the end) wholesome fun is not sufficient in modern times.

People want drama, want to see suffering and changing characters, want a lore rich universe and a lot of grey areas. Yes starwars got all this things now; but look at the feedback the fans or ""fans"" give back:

•We do not want the mystery of Han Solo lifted, he should stay as he is
But also
•We want a more fleshed out Han Solo, we want to learn more about him

•We want modern starwars movies, basically like the old trilogy, but shiny
But also
•We want modern starwars movies, but deep and interconnected and with darker and more realistic themes

i could go on and on and on.. lets picture a director or screenwriter: what the hell is he supposed to do? on the one hand, people want something new and refreshing but also people do not. 

What we are left with are some daring and modern takes in the right direction and not so daring, safer takes.

Examples:
•Rogue One: Murder of a rebel by a rebel and conflicts of interest within the rebellion:   I (who likes a modern and realistic take on starwars) loved it, gave the whole starwars universe a gritty and lived in look, but fans of the old trilogy hated it: ""are those supposed to be the good guys?"" 

•same movie: darth vaders rebel slaughter,  i had goosebumps seeing the true might and power of vader for the first time on a silver-screen, the pure fear in the rebels eyes as they at first did not know what they were facing, then the short burst of bravery when they shot at vader and then the horror of realisation that they do not stand a chance, letting them run in fear for their lives and facing pure terror when they realised that they are going to die. (Yes, comic and novel readers will know these things, but speaking if a movie-goers-perspective). But the old fans hated it, because it shed light on darth vaders power, luke was getting told of the whole time.

See? Two major things and im not even done with ONE movie.

TL;DR

•Old ""true"" fans want starwars of the old days: predictable, wholesome, light on the stomach, with clear lines between the (trigger warning) so called ""good"" rebels and the ""evil"" empire. 
•Modern fans want deep characters, expansive and interconnected lore, grey areas and daring decisions. they do not want a classic, wholesome starwars movie but a modern piece with modern writing and modern flow. can be gritty, realistic and dark.
•because of that, writers and directors can make no starwars movie that pleases everyone, and because of the backlash of Solo and the new 7th and 8th episode will never be able to make a good and modern starwars movie ever again.
•While actual professional movie critics (So not Angry Joe for example, he is not professional) love the new movies, ""true"" fans hate them, because they are not like the old movies (see above what that means), while modern fans are pretty confident in the new movies, but the voices of the modern fans are rendered useless, because of the way louder outcries of the ""true"" fans.",0,0,2018-10-09T20:35:37.000Z,Lee Marvin,UC31CS6LL_yi9jw1pFHuS9cA,UImXWiDFAoE,True,Ugys4z3O348TV9Zn2pN4AaABAg

"Vader and Krennic is my favorite scene...

If only because it's the Eichmann of evil (Krennic) being told off by the visible symbol of evil (Vader) that the Death Star is a useless distraction at best to the success of the Empire. At worst, it is the very seed of it's undoing. It showcases how Vader views something as threatening to his position as a physical weapon rivaling his power...and also how he begins to see it as an opportunity......which leads to that last hallway scene. It's epic and satisfying because we get to see Vader at his most publicly evilawesome. BUT, it is also palpable evidence of how Vader isn't playing the game. He could, at any time in that scene, snatch that data out of the rebels hands and end the threat to the Death Star. HE DOES NOT DO IT. He kills a bunch of guys and goes all beast mode....and in the end watches the plans fly away from his reach.

...because he doesn't want to keep the plans from getting out. He WANTS to find Obi-Wan. He wants to give the rebellion some hope.

Why would he do that?

"Man, I still haven't had time to sit down and watch this but like you kinda touched on, that was the problem. The big big Star Wars fans (me included) just didn't feel like seeing this. It didn't feel like something worth seeing. I remember when it was announced my thoughts were, ""Why?"" instead of when episode 7 or 8 were announced and I was completely on-board. I think Disney should have waited for this one, maybe if they released it after episode 9 was over with and the #'d saga was done for now. I didn't see this movie for many of the same reasons I haven't seen Ant Man and The Wasp. I'm invested in the large, multi movie story that they're telling (Episodes 7-9 and IW 1&2), I don't want to watch a movie in the same universe that has little to no effect on the overarching plots.",0,0,2018-10-09T17:39:35.000Z,Jacob Moore,UC_k1onj_15A-Kae3j0EDrjA,UImXWiDFAoE,True,Ugwntq6XTyb_8PjQdxJ4AaABAg

"My problem with the movie was that Disney used it as a checklist to Han.  Han leaves Corellia.  Han joins the Empire.  Han is leaves the Empire.  Han meets Chewie.  Han gets his blaster(?).  Han meets Lando.  Han wins the Falcon.  Han does the Kessel Run.  That isn't the problem, the problem lies in that, with the exception of leaving Corellia and joining the Empire, it all happens in a handful of days.  They should have done away with the idea of making a trilogy of Solo movies and did this one right.  In my eyes, this movie should have been made like Walk the Line.  Pick a key moment in Hans life and have him reflect to that point about how he got there, hitting all the checks as you move forward over the span of a dozen years.  The scene I would have picked?  The deleted scene from A New Hope where he enters the hanger and is confronted by Jabba.  

I firmly believe that trilogies and universes are helping to ruin film making these days.  Studios are to obsessed with making the new MCU or Star Wars trilogy to see the bigger picture.  It's to much about making the next billion dollar franchise then about making good movies that will stand the test of time.  That all said, I still enjoyed the movie, it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either.  I'm sad that this one failed so now Disney is stepping away from the solo story movies for now.  Because this one didn't do good we won't get a Obi-Wan or a Boba Fett movie.

"I mean, I disagree with the idea that it came from fatigue. The trades generally talk about how Kathleen Kennedy burned the core fan base that would see these movies 3-5 times in theaters there seemed to be a clear boycott from backlash over episode 8, enough so that it almost cost Kennedy her job and so her contract has only been extended 3 years, if she cannot course correct by episode 9 then Bob Iger will likely can her. (I for one can say I wanted to see this but chose not to because I agreed with the boycott, vote with your wallet etc.) Now I think I should also say the toxicity that has come out from a small vocal minority of the star wars fan base is disgusting, when I talk of the boycott I talk about the fans who boycott over legitimate criticism of the films direction. I personally do not like the way the franchise is going and given that Kennedy in investor and quarterly meetings pointed to the billion dollar earnings of the films as why her way was best so a boycott is really just to show that the super hardcore, and even casual, fans are not interested in her way. This won't be the case for all but the trades have generally accepted it as a core reason for the Solo flop.",0,0,2018-10-09T13:58:38.000Z,Deathstroke,UCSfSLGNbLSrsz31Ui2NDZ6A,UImXWiDFAoE,True,Ugy8kf40zirBbZVUNsJ4AaABAg

"Ok, I'm going to say this-the movie wasn't TOO bad (not as bad as Ep 7 & 8), but I can't stand that Disney threw out the Lucasfilm books! In my opinion, the Han Solo Trilogy (The Paradise Snare, The Hutt Gambit, Rebel Dawn) have a much better storyline. It shows Han's dealings with the Hutts, how he met Lando (and the explanation of why Lando was mad at him seems to me a lot more fleshed out), and overall gives us a better lead in to Han's personality by Episode 4. I can't stand these mediocre stories that are much worse than the EU (Granted, a few of the EU books/stories were odd, but mostly the overall story is much better than the way Disney went. And that even includes Rogue One. (I liked Rogue One as a movie, but showing how Mon Mothma was instrumental in bring the various Rebel groups into the Alliance (which Rebel Dawn does-which is why I am mentioning it here) is much more satisfying than having it be Jyn Erso-some random woman who wasn't even devoted to the Rebel cause until she was picked up. Also Bria Theren (from the trilogy of books) is a better character in my opinion than Han's love interest in the movie (although the movie copied a lot of her character and turned it round",0,0,2018-10-09T02:51:42.000Z,SJHFoto,UCHVPccRCGqml5iFJ1quDESg,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgxaS2TnhRSE7mO8qS54AaABAg

"I enjoyed this movie.  Along with the three things you wanted to see, I enjoyed seeing the Millenium Falcon all shiny and new and seeing how it ebded up looking like a flying pile of junk.  This movie flopped because some of the fan base has an overblown opinion about how they ""own"" the franchise and for some peculiar reason they think the three original films are good movies.  No Star Wars movie is a ""good movie"" (although I think Rogue One comes closest).  For the most part they are poorly written, poorly directed and poorly acted (not the actors' fault really).  But they are entertaining!  Any time you try to elevate a popcorn level piece of entertainment to the level of being a cinematic classic, you're going to be disappointed.

"Was hoping you would do one on Solo, wasn't sure which way you would fall here.  
I liked this movie, really.
A friend of mine and I, can argue endlessly about Solo.  Its like, did we see the same movie?
I find the comment that ""nobody wanted this movie"", quite laughable.
Really?  Of course we did, anything else is just silly talk.
We didn't want to know where he came from, we didn't want to know how he met Chewie, we didn't want to know
how he met Lando, we didn't want to know about the Kessel Run,  we didn't want to know how he won the Falcon,
etc, etc, etc.?
This is Han at the beginning...the beginning.
Had no problem with the actor playing Han, or other actors and actresses.
Found it a nice turn that the Empire gave him his last name, curious if the story progresses to give a reason
why he does not change it.
Every Star Wars movie does not have to be a epic.
Could the release timing have been better?  Yea.
I would have liked to have seen Han in pilot training and washout.  It's in the deleted scenes,
wonder why it was cut.  Perhaps, it might be more addressed later.
I get it wasn't the romantic history of Legends lore but, I like where they went.
I wouldn't mind if they just went back to one trailer, and that's it.  We seem to need the entire movie spelled out
to us in advance.
Star Wars had only one trailer?  And we still liked it.  Can you imagine that?
Solo is a fun movie, it answers some questions, and asks some other ones.
Is it a perfect movie.  No.  Haven't seen a perfect movie yet.

"I honestly think that this movie failed, because of oversaturation of Star Wars is apparently a real thing. Plus, I know they were shooting for kid friendly, but Spice is essentially meth in the SW universe. The Kessel run was avoiding Imperial checkpoints by skirting near the Maw Cluster. This fuel thing seems pointless G-rated simplification to assume kids can't or wouldn't be able to understand that Han was a drug runner for syndicates. Han is beloved because he is an outlaw. 
I personally think that this movie would've done better if it was pushed back and focused, as the primary protagonist, on Beckett. Changing the title to ""Outlaw"". In fact, most of the movie is pretty much would the same.  Just that, the heist, the betrayals, and stuff would've been interesting to have some things happen that aren't directly impacted by original trilogy characters, but shows new people that happen to organically incorporate original trilogy or prequel trilogy characters.

"I was honestly really surprised by how Good Solo was.

I was very much in the camp of ""We don't really need this."" And I only saw it cause my mom and I were going a little stir-crazy and we're both Star Wars fans and had nothing else to do. And it was Good, and I was surprised and glad that the thing that really did have the potential to poison one of my favorite characters with unnecessary and erronius backstory ended being a pretty great backstory, in spite of a few issues (I will miss the potential for the inclusion of something like the Sal-Solos from Legends, him getting his last name is kinda... eeehhhh, and I do think that, even with more time left to them at the end of Solo before A New Hope, that Han and Lando would not be trusted, good friends by the time of Empire based on how this movie portrayed the start of their relationship).

It was a level of quality and fitting-of-more-story-we-didn't-really-need. I reference as the Halo 4 of Star Wars; it's totally unnecessary if we're talking in terms of pure story, but we get a greater level of depth and characterization to an already great character because of it being made. We maybe didn't really need it, but we're certainly better off for having it. 

L3 was a character I didn't fully know I'd wanted for so long until I got her. A droid who recognizes they get a bit of a raw deal just cause they're machines in spite of the fact that they're as or often more intelligent than organic lifeforms, and is not at all shy about her feelings on that fact.

"The fatigue comes from the elephant in the room, they managed to fail in every movie(except Solo), Force Awakens and Rogue One were especially bad. Rogue One shooting problems caused that movie to not come together naturally, it was like a Frankenstein's monster. Solo was great in the end but the trailer was so low key and firing directors made people not believe in this movie I think. All the news about it were negative before the movie came out. I saw it because Ron Howard, I believe in him. The CG in this movie was invisible. The train sequence was amazing. Alden was charming, I had reservations because Han is a very familiar character to me but he was equally charming as Ford.

People come up with flaws after the fact about these flopped good movies. Same scrutiny would devastate Rogue One and TFA. The thing is these corporate movies live or die by the marketing, Solo was first great Disney Star Wars movie which is something they should recognize and let a sequel happen. Slowing down is a good choice because all these uncooked scripts and firing directors mean they are rushing like crazy. I understand TFA but the other movies had time to make solid scripts.

"Star Wars fatigue is not a thing....make good movies and they could release one a month far as I'm concerned. When this all started we had to wait 3 years for each movie.....and than George had Director/Producer fatigue and didn't make another movie for 16 years. Disney has totally messed this up by hiring JJ Abrams in the first place....what he did with Star Trek should have told everyone he was interested in rebooting the franchise ...with Star Trek in order to get a young Kirk and Spock he messed with the timeline....ok....it's probably the only way that could happen. Star Wars is a different animal all together......they had the principal actors that played Luke, Leia and Han but instead of using them....they abused them....no one wanted a reboot....we wanted continuation of the story. That's why Rogue 1 was good....it was continuation of the story....it fit...ok it was a little slow at first but the action scenes at the end of the movie were some of the best I have seen....not even counting the Vader scene...the battle scenes over Scariff...the intensity of the rebels and their desperation.....the suicide mission on the planet and the one taking out the star destroyers and their shield gate....that was just awesome stuff. TLJ was a total let down.....the only way you can explain it would be to say that we had some how entered the twilight zone and was in a different dimension because no one acted the way they did in the OT....people change....but not that much. Solo was ...ok....it looked like Star Wars but I think it's a mistake to try to make movies about beloved characters with other people....it just doesn't really work very well unless it's been so many years that you are talking to an entirely new generation...than maybe it would work...but with Star Wars since everyone has seen the old stuff...it probably wouldn't work than either. Would have just been better to make a story about new characters so you don't have those identity problems....the EU was great...there is room for lots of expansion and ideas in Star Wars...which is why the narrow minded view of Lucasfilm should be opposed by all.",0,0,2018-10-08T17:54:16.000Z,kannaman211,UCPlTMkJKBnPpGv9I_mM-MUg,UImXWiDFAoE,True,Ugz_cpSsdfrrhXEmlAV4AaABAg

In regards to Star Wars fatigue, I can lay blame for that on Disney, because Lucasfilm originally wanted to release the film this upcoming December, but Disney said no and made them release it in May, while Infinity War and Deadpool were still fresh in theaters.

I admit I was one of the people who didn't care about this movie or had any plans to see it in theaters. It didn't seem like a story that needed to be told and from my point of view in the original trilogy Han was the every man who's just trying to get by. The idea of him having some epic adventure seemed counterintuitive to that in my mind and made me right away believe that this was a movie for money first and the story second. While I saw trailers none of them really caught my attention and I ended up just writing the movie off as a cash grab that I didn't want to see.

I didn't feel like it was a story that needed to be told, but I was nonetheless keen to watch it. I was keen to watch it because I knew it would be different.

The one thing I can say I definitely LOVED about this movie, is that we didn't get over-the-top, pointless cameos. Like those two Mos Eisley cantina guys from A New Hope that turned up on Jedha in Rogue One.

"the problem with the actress doing the robot, she doesn't move like a robot, if you see her acting, it was just normal human movements. That is a let down. Compare with C3PO or K2SO.
Also it seems very much like Han was a bad pilot up until L3 downloaded into the interface

Also I feel very meh about the Maul cameo. It seems so forced in there as yet another way to make fans swoon over the film. Why did he need to take out his lightsaber as a show of power, it was overkill. Also for the fans who already knew his backstory (who this cameo is made for), it feels a bit underwhelming because we already know he loses his crime syndicate and dies eventually. 

The fanservice stuff you liked, i agree was good and didn't feel forced in tbh, because that is part of the characters. Also I did not like the dice, because they were there, for the sake of meaning in TLJ which just shows TLJ needs other stuff backing it up - not good

"Great job handling this not terrible but not that good Solo. Honestly, I didn't hate it but I didn't love it. I'm more angry at the state of Disney and LucasFilm with their behind the scene problems (notably with the actions of Kathleen Kennedy and their employees treatment of fans on social media) than I am with the writing problems of the Disney Star Wars era. I feel bad for the actors in Solo because the script is doing them no favors as Alden played a more layered character compared to Donald doing an impression while Emilia and Woody are being typecast hard on their usual schticks. L3 annoyed me and I only cheered when she was shot down during the rebellion. The whole experience itself felt rather forgettable as a result of something that didn't feel like there was any heart put into rather just settling into being another Star Wars story. I will give it credit for some nice action scenes and cool visual moments (when you can actually see it, yeah I forgot how bad the lighting was lol). After Episode 9, Disney needs to commit to their ""slowdown"" and get LucasFilm under control because at this time I just feel that this series has just become another just franchise instead of something that felt exciting and full of spirit when done well.",0,0,2018-10-08T06:38:33.000Z,Andrew Forbes,UCXLFj6gHvOCyPi2lFVNerZw,UImXWiDFAoE,True,Ugw7iUv8eNvacOzhhS14AaABAg
"I really liked this movie and thought it was good, but I can think of a fair few reasons why it failed, which I will list.

1. Last Jedi backlash. People were still mad about TLJ. Now, this wasn't the biggest reason nobody saw this movie, just because I list it first - after all, not everybody who saw TLJ hated it. But it's undeniably a factor in why a lot of the diehard Star Wars fans who normally would've been lining up for days to see this movie didn't end up watching it - they were still mad at the insulting pile of shit that was TLJ. Meaning this movie had to make its money off of the casual moviegoing audience.
2. They failed to market this movie to the casual moviegoing audience. How many trailers did they release for this movie? How many posters, how many teasers, whatever? I remember seeing one teaser like, a year before the movie came out, then one full trailer, and very occasionally seeing the poster on the odd bus and then the movie was out. Now, I'm a big Star Wars fan who made sure to go see it but to the casual audience who doesn't feel an obligation to watch every movie that comes out in a big franchise, it's plausible that they barely even heard about this movie before it came out. I mean how many times do you go to a movie when you've only seen the poster and don't really know what it's about, if it's not a part of a big franchise you love?
3. Nobody asked for this movie. The casual audience don't give a shit what movie you make, if it interests them they'll watch it. But the diehard Star Wars fans were not dying to know Han Solo's origin story. No writers were desperately calling up Disney with a great idea for a Han Solo movie that they want to pitch. Disney just mandated it be made despite nobody asking for it. And so the only way they were going to sell this movie was by making it look super appealing in the marketing. And then they barely fucking marketed it.
4. They released it five months after the last Star Wars movie. As you mentioned in the video, Star Wars fatigue is a thing - it's not Marvel, you can't expect to release like three movies in one year and make lots of money on all of them. People like Star Wars but it has never been that kind of franchise. In addition to people generally being a bit tired of Star Wars, them releasing it so soon after TLJ meant that the hardcore fans - who are really the primary target of a movie like this - did not have time to get over the previously mentioned backlash to TLJ. Like... Some people can very easily stay mad for five months. Particularly when their favourite franchise has been shit on. 
5. Also related to when it was released - they released it when there were other, MUCH bigger movies being released at a similar time. Solo came out two weeks after Deadpool 2, a month after Avengers: Infinity War and nearly two weeks before the Incredibles 2. These are movies that a LOT more people were a lot more excited for than Solo - the much anticipated sequel to the highest grossing R-rated film of all time (other than that Jesus movie), THE big, defining superhero team-up movie that everyone had been waiting for since the first Avengers movie and that would pull in all of the combined audiences of Marvel, and the sequel to the Incredibles, a movie that everyone loved and had been waiting for for over a decade. These movies were much more highly anticipated by hardcore fans and casual moviegoers alike and more to the point, they were all MUCH better marketed than Solo. Yet Disney decided to release it so close to them. The thing is though, the average person only goes to the movies 3-4 times in a single year and when you're trying to release your movie that nobody asked for, you barely marketed for and after alienating the primary group of people who were likely to actually go see it, AT THE SAME TIME as three other movies that themselves generated a LOT of hype...

"That droid is BEYOND annoying! ... That said, I see where you're coming from here. Though I wonder how much I will agree/disagree with you when it comes to TLJ. I agree with you on ANH, ESB, ROTJ, ROTS, AOTC, hell you even made me see TPM in a new light, something which a critic is meant to do. TFA, Yeah you made some good points but there were some things that still didn't work for me. Rogue One......... Yeah kinda hard not to agree with you on that one ;p. Solo, I getcha... 

But TLJ... T...L... Friggin'... J..... Good bloody luck. That movie is hated and I mean HATED by the majority nowadays and it's hard to dispute that. I'll also come right out and say it, not only do I DESPISE that movie, it's in my bottom 10, tied for second place with Twilight Braking Dawn Part 1. It's below the Shark Gang Titanic movie, it's below Pearl harbor, It's below Wing Commander, Last Airbender, Max Payne, it's even below Michael bay's TF series. The ONLY movie I hate more than TLJ is Garbage Pale Kids. Think about it, that is how much I hate it personally. Some share my sentiments to an extent, the same amount or even more so, where as others..... They like it yet agree with our critiques of the movie.

"I personally was one of the people that bad mouthed the movie from the beginning. I didn't think we needed it because we already knew everything we needed to know about him. I got interested when the Super Bowl TV spot aired because it made the movie look AWESOME, but I still wasn't fully on board with the idea. I had just got back home from college, and  My mom finally was able to convince me to give it a shot and she it in theaters, and I'm so glad she did. THE MOVIE BLEW ME AWAY! Yes, it has a semi slow start (that was necessary) but once it got going it really got going! I wasn't expecting to see Darth Maul pop up but that made the movie even better! I loved the show down at the ending, to me it had a Pirates of the Caribbean vibe with all the double crosses and never knowing who to fully trust (which makes sense because they're basically space pirates). My mom and I are huge Star Wars fans and loved it , my Dad; basically falls asleep anytime one of the movies is on, but he came with us to see this in theaters and at the end goes ""WOW,that was really good."" It really makes me sad that a lot ""die hard"" fans boycotted the movie because they were ticked over the TLJ, mainly because of what happened to Luke, which if you didn't expect that after TFA and all the interviews Mark Hamill gave about the sequels not being Luke's story anymore I don't know what to tell you. I really hope Disney reconsiders finishing the SOLO trilogy because I'd personally love to see exactly how Han gets mixed up with Jabba. Alden Ehrenreich did a great job as playing Han from the attitude to the mannerisms. I think another reason this movie didn't well is because when Disney bought Star Wars they said the EU was no longer cannon, correct me if I'm wrong, but to my understanding that also included anything pertaining to Han's background. With that said all the die hard fan-boys have had since the 90's/2,000's was the EU, so this threw a wrench in everything they knew about Han.",0,0,2018-10-08T05:39:07.000Z,Holland Fray,UCGfEC4BR23GPxsSq4QDEDUw,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgwICAVBPUDppGdF3514AaABAg

"Personally, I didn’t really like this movie. It just didn’t appeal to me at all. The reason why I commented on this video instead of CinemaSins’s video, is because I didn’t like this video very much. It was basically praising the animation, voice acting and making references to songs. This just felt below CinemaWins’ usual high standards. Not to mention, what really bothered me the most was when he said that it’s just a kids movie, and how it has so much undeserved hate. First of all, this movie has 72% on Rotten Tomatoes and an 7.9 on IMDB. How is that too much hate? If anything, I think this movie’s getting too much praise. 

And also, saying that it’s just a kids movie basically implies that no one is allowed to enjoy it or dislike it. First and foremost, you praise lots of kids movies on this channel and you enjoy them, so this just feels hypocritical. Second, this is a movie from DREAMWORKS, a company that can do BETTER than this. People are allowed to express their own opinions, and not everyone is going to like the same thing. Saying that it’s a kids movie doesn’t magically fix its flaws. Every movie has flaws. 

I know people will say that this is just supposed to be a fun and simple movie, but this a reviewing channel where people talk about whatever the topic is; so of course people are going to analyse it. Besides, this movie has a message that they want you to take seriously. In fact, I think this movie teaches a terrible message to kids, about being happy all the time always, and everything will sort itself out. That message annoys me to no end, and I think children deserve better than this.",0,0,2018-10-08T05:16:57.000Z,Unicorn Bunny,UC9YkPv1WwaBQfstPg451HSg,XNMocrw-E54,True,UgzPkfEumic5ctrWg4h4AaABAg

"I do disagree with your idea as to why this failed. Star Wars Fatigue does exist, yes, but I wanted to see this film. I really wanted to, however, I wanted Disney to listen. Not to what I had to say about Solo, but what I had to say about Episode 8. I reject Episode 8, and several thousand of us also reject it. I love Star Wars. It's a film series I grew up on, with the prequels coming out in my childhood. I remember seeing them in theaters, and the feel of awe I had for them. I didn't like Episode 7 because it felt like a bastardization of Star Wars: A New Hope and episode 8 is... It's painful to watch. Mark looked so betrayed after seeing the final cut. Had I seen a Star Wars that gave me what I asked for (Luke being a wise Yoda-like, or more Obi-Wan figure, a grand battle between two armies, and another dual with Like confronting his enemy and his apprentice taking on her equal and opposite. We all wanted that), I would have seen Solo. And with Obi-Wan's movie cancelled, I feel like I want Episode 9 to fail as well, as my message wasn't conveyed to the Disney executives. I want Star Wars in my life! I need Space Wizards fighting with ""laser swords"" while battling evil factions on alien planets. Solo wasn't a film I was excited to see even with a good Episode 8, but a Mail film would be awesome. I want to see Starkiller on screen. If we could have a ""Saving Private Ryan"" type film set in the Clone Wars, that'd be killer! That one wouldn't need Jedi as main characters. Maybe Kit Fisto is the general, or General Skywalker is referenced, but Clones are Star Wars to me.

"I really liked Solo, it was a fun little adventure that felt like the old Han solo novels. But the thing that was really amazing about Solo was that it FELT like it was a part of a larger universe. It had tons of references to other parts of the universe in way that doesn't shove it in your face and doesn't punish if you don't get the reference but still rewards you if you do get the reference while making it feel like it was a part of a universe with a bunch of other characters and stories going on. And it made me come to a realization about all the new star wars movies. They don't have that feeling. While I like all of the new star wars movies, I realize that they feel too clean and self contained. Every time they have the chance to reference the larger universe they instead just insert a new thing, character, vehicle, planet etc. And I honestly think that is the biggest issue with the new movies, the reason they don't feel as cohesive as the rest of the things in the star wars universe. Star Wars has always had a liberal slant because Lucas was a California hippie and everything he did had his views in it, so politics isn't the issue with the new movies because honestly the other films were far more politic in their time, heck the prequels had direct references to real life politics. But the issue is the lack of references to the other parts of the universe, that the other films, books, and games all had that makes the new films feel just slightly off. I hope they learn from solo and use it's style of acknowledging the rest of the universe in future star wars movies, if nothing else Howard should direct more star wars movies because he clearly understands the feel.",34,0,2018-10-08T04:21:14.000Z,vidarDJ16starkill,UCd1tQum1BXDjqOlvhjV2xyQ,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgzogMA2djRdEFx5Xnx4AaABAg

"Solo failed because Disney tried to make it an ""event movie"".  It simply wasn't an ""event movie"", mostly because it was released in May in a crowded field of other ""event movies"", namely Infinity War (which was the real event movie of the summer).  The bigger problem?  Disney controlled the release date of every single movie that could have been a success.  Infinity War, Incredibles 2, Deadpool 2, and Solo.  Disney should have known that Infinity War was going to stay at the top for several weeks.  Incredibles 2 is your family movie.  Deadpool 2 would be a huge success coming off Deadpool.  Solo?  Good lord, they should have moved it to December where they had next to nothing coming out.  But they wanted to make it an event movie.  Well, it's not.  It's not part of the saga.  Just like Rogue One was not an event movie and not part of the saga.  SJW droid ruined, at least for me, a very significant portion of the movie.  I know they intended it as a joke, but it did not come across that way.  Maybe if it had been done only a few times, it would have been funny.  But it's like Jar Jar.  When it's done throughout the movie as much as it is, it stops being funny and starts becoming groan worthy.

Those are the moments that stick out and make me not want to watch it again.  Yes, Han knowing Shriiwook is explained, but in a completely unnecessary and ridiculous way.  Thor understands Groot, but you don't see him responding with ""I am Groot"" the same way you don't see Rocket walking around saying ""I am Groot"".

They could have and should have gone into more detail of Han's time in the academy, especially since they had planned to make this into a trilogy.  Instead, they crammed a bunch of stuff into it, give Han the Falcon, and then talk about doing a job for a gangster on Tattooine (clearly referring to Jabba), but it takes place some 10 years before ANH.  I agree that they did everything I wanted to see, especially the Kessel Run, but I'm also in agreement that Han was trying to pull Ben's leg and exaggerate his accomplishments.  FYI, the novel came first, so they didn't ""fix it"" in the novel, they changed it for the movie for Han's character.

So yeah, Solo failed because Disney tried to make an event movie out of a standalone Star Wars movie and they just shouldn't have.  They also, imo, should have cut all the ""equal rights"" bs that seemed to be the sole reason for L3 to be in the movie.  Does anyone realize that the Falcon isn't just barely held together anymore with systems and subsystems rerouted and what not.  The Falcon now has the brain of a SJW droid inside it.  That's the reason the Falcon is always so temperamental.",0,1,2018-10-08T03:47:48.000Z,SpecialAgent45,UCcmuDRY2g0k_bolgS3GGsgQ,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgyILkDwMS99g2oJpw94AaABAg

"I came out of the theater relatively happy with Solo, but that was because, as a filmmaker, I was floored by the quality of the film when all we heard was how awful the production was going, especially with how little time they had to make the film when compared to the usual production timeframe.

I think Solo is fine, if a little corporate. It’s still a really fun origin story with lots of potential to branch off in fun directions. One thing that does amuse me: this movie was boycotted, in spite of being everything that Star Wars fans burned by the last three films were wanting.

Also, this was epic in theaters. No Rogue One due to the exponential increase of SJW but it was damn good.

This movie for all intents and purposes was an swtor movie ;p gunslinger, hutt cartel, actual smuggling... and all.

I think the big issue for me, bigger than the SJW thing was that they spent almost no time in the imp military at all, though a little nod was better than none, and no swoop bike race or side plot with all of the other rich characters in the Han universe. :( IG88, Dash, Dengar, etc..

"Scenes and certain character interactions in Solo are excellent, and I really quite liked Paul Bettany. My issue is that somehow, a Han centric film didn't adequately show him becoming the cynical, selfish man he is in IV. In Solo, he's relentlessly upbeat and with every betrayal looks at it like ""oh no. What a shame."" I don't blame Ehrenreich for it, either; most of the cast's reactions to plot twists were way too mellowed out to chalk it up to miscasting. The directing was odd, the lighting was horrible, and Han just wasn't Han. I liked him, but he was Han Solo in name only. Solo is a collection of entertaining sequences and characters suppressed by a dull plot, uninspired scenery, and too many references to better films.

"I totally get what you mean. I think it is the reshoots being blended. One of the main reasons Lord and Miller were dropped was they were being too cheeky with the material and you can bet there were tons of side gags in the background. And remember they hired the DP. Guessing messing with the gamma made removing some of those gags easier, and it could sell the tone the Kazdans wanted more. Really sad about it though. Because of color continuity amazing scenes like the Kesselrun just got too dark. Not the DP's fault, but a sad thing in general. Wish the Lord and Miller cut was the movie we got even though I probably would have enjoyed that less than this.

It not only changed movies but also changed the movie going experience for everyone in the world. I heard all the bad press regarding this movie, the firings, etc. so I didn't know what to expect when I went to see Solo and frankly, I wasn't expecting much. Boy was I surprised. First this was a perfect representation of a Space Western, which is what Star Wars always was (with Space Wizards and laser swords thrown in). And this movie was also a great heist movie + buddy cop movie. This movie was an enjoyment to watch and I was glad that because so many people put it down before hand, not a lot leaked out regarding the plot...so I didn't know what was going to happen at any given point.

"My honest opinion, it's an okay movie, not a terrible movie, not a great movie. I thought the actor for Solo was fine. I think it's a decent movie overall just an unnessecary one. Didn't think it was needed prior to be annouced and having seen it, still don't think it needed.

Also didn't like the origin of Han's last name. It was bascially what they did with the origin of Rogue One's name. A throwaway spur of the moment decision by a character. It was lame, pointless and unneeded. It was fine simply being his last name by birth.",0,0,2018-10-07T23:57:18.000Z,Brian Beatty,UCu6D2-bMQxdPTHWv8w1WRTA,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgzBqGooSmhYs9kuniB4AaABAg

"Star Wars fatigue wasn't why this failed. 

Star Wars fans felt like they were being disrespected and not listened to after The Last Jedi fall-out and decided they would talk with their wallets as their words were being ignored or cast aside by a n arrogant leader at Lucasfilm and her underlings.   Kathleen Kennedy and Rian Johnson killed the Golden Goose with The Last Jedi, and then tried to treat the fans like idiots.   They thought, that they would drown out the ""original"" fans the same way the MARVELDISNEY side made ""comic book fans"" irrelevant to the box office, when they started changing around story-lines and oversimplifying them.     So Lucasfilm/Kathleen Kennedy thought ""oh we'll just phase out the original Star Wars fans, cause the mainstream is gonna carry this just like it does MARVELDISNEY and we can do whatever we want and those complaining will be a small minority in the end.""     

They got a rude awakening.  

And Solo was unfortunately caught in the crossfire of that.  If all Disney takes away from this is ""Star Wars fatigue"", they will continue to pay the price for their lack of vision.",5,12,2018-10-07T23:31:56.000Z,carrastealth,UCykbH1_NyuFcYUqpUnzP5rQ,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgxyRo8YRuLCk3oaT094AaABAg

"I'm not the most clued up on the Old EU or this new Disney EU outside of the movies but I'll give my opinion on this. Solo wasn't a movie that interested me at all. We knew all we needed to know about Han from the OT. There was nothing this movie could add to the character or show that we needed to know about him. That's the biggest draw back on this movie; it's just not needed and adds nothing new to the franchise. 

Currently, it's as if Lucasfilm are too scared to make anything outside of the OT and Sequels or separate from existing characters. They need to make a spin off movie or show that's set away from any existing characters or events so the writers and directors can truly go and do something unique and interesting.

The new show 'The Mandalorian' holds a good amount of promise. Everyone loves Mandalorians. I only hope it's more dark and gritty than what we've seen so far from Disney (it's a long shot I know). I also hope it focuses on the more extreme side of the Mandalorians such as the Bounty Hunters, Deathwatch and the Crusaders. I'm not the biggest fan of the Rebels Mandalorians or the Clone Wars pacifist ones. I hope it focuses on the EU Mandalorians and treats being Mandalorian more like living a way of live as it was in the Old EU where you had aliens that were Mandalorians.",0,0,2018-10-07T23:10:42.000Z,Dylan  Drummond,UC8EdRpeq7lT_ht21-Hsh-hA,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgwuLOfDUI9UmKyvqLV4AaABAg

"3:00 I'm gonna have to disagree with that because the main perception is that only wookiees could speak Shyriiwook but could understand Basic. It's been long established that other species (humans included) couldn't speak wookiee is because they don't have the same throat physiology. It would be like trying to teach a chimpanzee to speak English; they don't have the same throat and tongue placement to allow them to pronounce words. Also Han sounds ridiculous when he does it here which is probably why he doesn't do it for the remainder of the movies. I would also have to disagree with the reasons that you gave for why he did it as there are other methods for Han to get Chewie's attention and save each other. 

3:29 So, you know about Kit Fisto being from Glee Anslem but you don't know about Shyriiwook and why it can only be spoken by wookiees? 

4:28 I'm glad that you pointed out the operatic parts of the music as this movie from all of the Disney Star Wars has the only opera in it that I can recall. I didn't even notice this when I watched the movie in theaters because I was so bored. 

6:30 But the question comes up: why does this guy have a Sith Holocron when he's working for Darth Maul? Shouldn't Darth Maul have it at his hideout at Dathomir? I mean, isn't that the point of the 2nd and 3rd seasons in Rebels? He was searching for it? 

8:33 ""Equal rights?"" She says. She's a droid. The whole galaxy went to war against them about a decade ago. They also take people's jobs by being cheap and replaceable. Somebody wasn't paying attention. 

9:27 Sorry, that's not what happens when you remove a droid's restraining bolt. They don't suddenly gain the ability to communicate with other droids and smash things like in WALL-E. Droids in Star Wars have various levels of programming and processing power from simple tasks to sophisticated abilities. Furthermore, most droids are regularly scheduled for memory wipes that prevents them from having personalities. That's why a droid just coming off the assembly line (R4 series) don't have much of an identity and personality to them when compared to older droids (R2-D2, C-3PO). 

11:20 It could also be said another musical piece poached from a much better film due to laziness from the composer and director (and, possibly, producer). 

12:24 It's not because the ship itself is long-lived (ROTS) and has been from one side of the galaxy to the other? No, it's because of a droid who's whole point was to have freedom has now been slaved to a ship driven by humans and instead could've just as easily been repaired with its memories still in place.

After Lando leaves the picture everything is just so slow and boring. None of the twists are surprising and they all take too long to happen, the cast's chemistry dries up, and having Han choose to do the right thing and help the rebellion *here* cheapens what is supposed to be a genuine face-turn in the original trilogy. He doesn't have to be an ass who's completely unsympathetic to those around him here, but that sympathy shouldn't be coming before his desire to save his own hide. Plus it doesn't help that the person and the rebellion he's sticking his neck out for are bland and un-compelling.

"Solo is a gooooood movie. But, it isn't a Star Wars good movie. We expect more from that universe. And they can deliver more. I also think there are issues in where they start Han. I think that, for a lot of people, and certainly for myself, Han needed to grow more. I think Han's story needed to be a series, not a movie. Also, it is vital to seperate an actor's performance from the character they are given. Rose was a bad character. Kelly Marie Tran though, did an excellent job. The entire Finn/Rose plot was weak and poorly constructed, even though it was well executed by all involved. And the same is true of the bits surrounding L3-37's character. I disliked her character alot in places. But Phoebe Waller-Bridge was perfect in her acting and delivery. They were writing problems.

"I loved the movie, though I have to say I did enjoy it strangely more the 2nd and 3rd time watching it. I feel myself notpicking but I just had minor details in the movie I would have done differently. For like Mauls reveal: Awesome, but the lightsaber felt unessecary for me. I already freaked out recognizing the voice :D. Also the soundtrack is awesome in most parts, but does feel sometimes unfinished (intro and Dryden's Yacht theme). The red mandalorian armor was awesome to see but I hoped to finally see something mandalorian in the movies, dang I wanted it so much to see Dryden suit up in that! Last nitpick, the very last shot should have been the Falcon entering Hyperspace, and the next-last shot the dice. Overall a very very statisfying movie. Showing the ground assault of the Empire like its WW2 germans, showing the ""lawless time"", just like Rogue One a cool look on the other side of SW where the little heroes live. Btw Kessel Run was the most statisfying part for me. Great visualisation, Star Destroyer shot was bloodboiling and the tension was great. I did not know there was maybe a sequel planned - and that is why I felt double emotions with the Maul reveal, but this is a good direction of SW movies. Not too many sidetracks which unfortunatly TLJ did (though my favo SW movie still), but this gives me hope on Episode 9 and other stories, hopefully Kenobi.

"the movie is decent, i mean the quality of all big movies today is rarely actually bad. If star wars wasn't a thing and this came out, i'd likely say it's better. It didn't feel like star wars to me. They succeed on what feels like luck, not the force. Which does explain han's mindset in the originals. There was no strong twist, it didn't feel like they were a underdog, just one group outsmarting anothergroup. Plus in terms of character development, han and Qi'ra are really the only ones that are different from the start to finish, no one else seemed that important.  He didn't progress enough towards the originals.
Saying that, Personally if they released one every year, i would for sure still go see them. Make it an event! But i get other people think it's to much. Preferred it to no movie.",0,0,2018-10-07T21:40:32.000Z,Charles Inman,UC2O0dZydF4LEPiAS_J6zjFg,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgzMtjqRkDS5YpiCMo54AaABAg

"This movie left me very confused. Not due to the plot or anything, but just about my feelings on it. As a heist movie it was a solid movie with so beautiful camera work and this might be the best directing I've seen from Ron Howard since Apollo 13. However, it really does not seem like a Star Wars movie, and not in a good way. It echos how I feel about Ehrenrich as well. He's clearly a good actor and worked his butt off with the scenes given to him, but he never felt like a version of Han for me. Solo is definitely a movie I'll watch again, but probably not for a while as I need more time to think about it. I will say that I think it's too bad the movie flopped. They had a great sequal set up and I would have loved to see where they took Qi'ar. It felt like that sequel set up might have taken the character somewhere that would allow Clarke to show off a bit more range and have a better role than she was saddled with for most of Solo.",0,0,2018-10-07T21:40:15.000Z,Derangel,UCLkrTKkXZm-FRTObWwZSKCg,UImXWiDFAoE,True,Ugzd5CTTU8oFhq7vr214AaABAg

"Easily my favorite of the ""new"" Star Wars movies. It wasn't perfect by any means, some acting was questionable, and there were a few plot holes and questionable decisions, but all things considered it's a great film. It was grounded in (Star Wars) reality, had a dark and gritty atmosphere that gets away from J.J. Abrams and Ryan Johnson's eye-popping flare that detracted from the actual movies. Solo also had some great visuals in its own right, a plot that was grounded throughout the film, clear character goals and motivations, and some superb performances. Numerous times throughout the movie I thought, ""Yeah, THAT'S Han or ""Hell yes, THAT'S Lando."" My only problem is with behind the scenes production. I think if this movie was given 6 more months to allow for more polish and cleanup on a few problems, and a December release instead of May, it could've been fantastic. But as it stands, even with its drawbacks, it's still my favorite of the new films. 8/10.",1,0,2018-10-07T21:36:25.000Z,ThunderStorm,UCMg2J8oL60yhhq-YomwXEyg,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgyvhRG7JYrPa6-g6bJ4AaABAg

"Star Wars fatigue isn't a real thing. Marvel have made 6 movies in 2 years and people are craving more. The reason why Solo flopped is because the spin off films (Rogue one, Solo) are made for the hardcore Star Wars fans. Hardcore Star Wars fans are the type who knew Rogue One wasn't a sequel to TFA. Those fans happen to be the fans that Lucasfilm pissed off with The Last Jedi. Their idiotic political agenda and their attack on the fans caused people to boycott Solo.

"I am going to throw in my two cents and be perfectly blunt, if anyone that sees this comment disagrees I understand, I have a lot of unpopular opinions on movies, okay here it goes: I liked solo more than rogue one, please let me explain before you start insulting my intelligence in the comments, to me rogue one didn’t quite feel like Star Wars, it felt more like a generic thriller re-skinned to look like Star Wars. The characters seemed so out of place and even out of genre, there weren’t enough aliens, the movie was more or less characters stealthing around, the fights, seemed wrong, and I remember part of the plot being driven by a bunch of tools sitting at a table arguing. In solo we have characters with charisma, aliens that are just fun to look at, the fights look good, and the ship flying and space dog fights were great. In a nutshell I guess it’s sort of a tone thing, rogue one’s tone was a sort of “we need a plan, we need to do what’s right, the galaxy is counting on us” solo’s tone was more of “ okay we need money and lots of it, these guys are being pains in the neck, pew pew pew, alright chums let’s do this Leroy Jenkins”",0,1,2018-10-07T21:00:38.000Z,Markus Allen,UCX-mKi2Bv6pvGQj_BHSBpkg,UImXWiDFAoE,True,Ugy6gHSa0w4kA2YNAo94AaABAg

While I like your video i have to disagree on one part. If Marvel decides to kill one person between Cap and Iron Man (which i hope they dont. I want to see them both die fighting along side each other with cap wielding his old shield and mjolnir that would be great) I think that it would be Cap. Thats the only believable way I see him exiting the MCU. I can see Iron man retiring from the fight and just being a mentor to Peter but Cap... I just cant see him retiring. He's not someone who would back down from a fight. He would push on to his last breath so I think he will definitely die in this film. But other than that I really enjoyed your video.

"After seeing TLJ, I sort of got tired of Star Wars movies, a franchise that I’ve loved for a long time. But when I finally sat down and watched Solo: A Star Wars Story, I was actually pleasantly surprised. 

Aside from the fact that the film can get overly dark at times, making some stuff hard to see, the overall look of the film; the dirty, lived in feeling of this world, really immersed me into this film. The look of the Stormtroppers and the aliens, as well as the planets and droid designs, and even a few of the soundtracks, it all blended together to create an interesting side of Star Wars that I would want to explore further. This film and Rogue One are by far the most interesting additions to the franchise since Disney bought the IP.

"As an editor, I feel obliged to tell you, that editors have zero influence on the final look of the film. When editing is complete, the movie gets handed over to a colorist, who adjusts every single shot to a specific look. This process is overseen by the DP, who has already shot his footage with this specific look in mind. The final say is always with the director, who had the original vision for the movie's look. The fact that some shots might look brighter in the cameras in the bonus footage doesn't mean anything. These days, the image you shoot is never your finale image. Everything is shot with the final color grading in mind. That's why shots are often filmed over- or underexposed, so you can properly adjust them later.",0,0,2018-10-07T20:16:51.000Z,The Omnitorium,UCwB8wAd72qTaZuxRkeTsnYg,UImXWiDFAoE,True,Ugyz3jX39j4zH_V9QuB4AaABAg

"It did NOT fail because people didn't care, and the anecdote is just a story. The truth is, Rogue One and the Last Jedi were very disappointing to many fans and as the song/saying goes ""once bitten, twice shy"". Why feel the sting of disappointment and be out $20+ for a movie that will likely do an injustice to a beloved character just as the last big movie did an injustice to the main story line and universe that was already established. 

I respect your right to have your opinion, but It didn't suit the rest of the video. 

Really? ""Star Wars Fatigue"" You are a sucker if you are buying that and you're a con if you are trying to sucker other people into buying that.

All that being said. Thank you for pointing out that the movie didn't have to have Han making the Kessel Run in 12 Parsecs. Like you said, they admitted they wrote the wrong word.

"I still maintain that the biggest problem with this film was when it came out.  They rushed it too soon after The Last Jedi, so the public essentially got oversaturated in a short time.  And I think Solo coming out so soon after The Last Jedi and being advertised as fun and going back to the Star Wars we know and love probably felt like a smack in the face to everyone who was already disappointed with The Last Jedi, so naturally they didn't go see it and probably continue to hate The Last Jedi rather than giving that movie another shot.  Even The Empire Strikes Back wasn't loved at first.  But I've enjoyed everything Star Wars has been doing up until now.  Resistance, sadly, looks like garbage, and that makes me sad.

"My problem with this movie is that it feels so... By the numbers. It feels more like an origin story for all of Han’s accessories and how he got mixed up in the smuggler life. I’d much rather have seen something that delved into his character more, what makes him tick besides having a hard-on for Qira. Also the Han at the end of this movie really doesn’t feel like the Han from episode 4 in terms of his outlook on life, so it feels like something’s missing, and because this movie flopped so hard, it feels like we’re not bridging that gap, which this movie should have done, we don’t need 2 movies to tell his origin story. As for the Han at the end of episode 4, the one that finally decided to help the resistance that was just buried and needed some motivation to surface, we never see that. I feel like this movie should more so have delved into why he lost the will to risk his life to do the right thing. On its own, it’s kind of a fun space adventure, but considering its part of a huge franchise and is dealing with one of the most beloved characters in cinema history, it should have been handled with more thought and care, and considering the production issues, I doubt they tried very hard to make it as good as it could possibly be, more like they were trying to meet a deadline after they got set back by creative differences.

I didn’t like that big alien next to the black hole at all because it was stupid and unnecessary and clearly the movie thought we have to have something gigantic happen when that doesn’t need to be the case. And I didn’t like the civil right droid because she was just unlikable it’s hard not to read in that they are trying to say white people are terrible in the past and now when treat black people terribly and they’re being miss treated which isn’t so if I agree with and if you don’t think they were trying to say that it’s probably because you’re great with it. But I like this movie I absolutely hated the reveal that BA warrior was like 16-year-old little girl that was on believably gay they could’ve made it at least a young boy it is so unbelievable are young girl could do all that stuff and would be that strong if she were muscular female alien maybe.,0,0,2018-10-07T19:41:03.000Z,Jesse Collins,UCVx-5Sm33uigZvXOcMnkoxw,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgyOpia_FSsLxXr3sqB4AaABAg

"I liked this movie, I think it's ""more than fine"". I still have some issue and one of them is the fact that a random dude named Han. Yup, didn't like that one bit.
I also don't really like the actor who played Han nor Emilia Clarke (I don't like her at all in any role. Don't agree with you on the fact that she's a good actress and I find her barely decent. There, I said it.)
Also, having seen this movie in theaters (and in Italian) I felt a bit robbed off its true ""nature"". I've gotta see it again in English because a lot of things get lost in translation, despite the Italian voice actors did a very good job.
Overall a nice Star Wars movie with its shining moments and callbacks!
I still don't understand what's going to happen to the other two movies? They're not gonna be made? Like, at all?
I had a pretty good theory about Qi'ra and Darth Maul, so it is kinda disappointing. Maybe they're write a novel about it? Or make a comic?

"Honestly, Solo was GREAT. Alden did a PERFECT young Han. People always seemed to ask why they picked him if he didn't look like Harrison Ford.

"I just wanted to get my 2¢ out there: I didn't like this movie because it wasn't the History I loved. 
  Han originally did have family, he had an uncle who hated his Antics and forced him into the Empire. Which made Han a really great pilot, Having learned not only had a pilot Tie fighters and tie bombers, but several outdated ships that we never got to see that apparently handled like the Millennium Falcon. Han actually enjoyed his time as an imperial officer, until he found several other Imperial officers drunkenly beating on a young Wookie, Who Han saved by killing the officers. He took care of that young Wookie, and found out his name was Chewbacca. Han then got into spice trading and spice smuggling to help raise Chewbacca, and eventually wound up winning the Millennium Falcon and a game of pazaak against Lando Calrissian. Han did have a heart before the movies, it's just he was taught to only care about him and ,the only person he ever truly cared about, Chewbacca. So that's why when New Hope comes around he's a little bit more bitter and just wants the reward and leave.",226,30,2018-10-07T19:30:04.000Z,Bryce Mckenzie,UCpzA6pORl6-eHiQL1PrM_iw,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgzY61a9_eAAvOskyjx4AaABAg

"Reasons it flopped:
1. Almost nobody wanted it.
2. Casted guy that doesnt look like Han or tries to emulate him.
3. Last Jedi lost hope in Disney in fans eyes.
4. Movie covered things we know or that we dont need to know and done them badly (solo name, pistol, kessel run etc)
5. Movie was average in quality plot wise. Moved too fast.
6. Han is still the same at the start or still makes the mistakes in originals he should have learnt in Solo(trusting etc).
7. Budget was too big for it.
8. BTS drama and reshoots etc.

If this was Lando trilogy with Han at some points with actor that looks like Ford (Anthony Ingruber) then it would have been muvh better.

"Before I watch the video where I at the utmost agree, I really enjoyed this film, it was good and my family are still stunned as to how bad a rep this film got for no reason. Every complaint is so petty to the point that it feels like everyone's ragging on Star Wars because it's cool to rag on Star Wars and turn against the franchise. I mean seriously, it does not ruin the entire story of Han to have someone else give him the surname Solo, it doesn't ruin life as we know it, the fact that he kept the name means that he to a point embraced what the naming meant to him.

Also Fuel Motherfucker, suck it cinemasins for shitting on the concept of fuel in The Last Jedi

Following that; Enfys Nest's theme is actually cleverly done with the childlike choir alluding to how they're not actually the evil ones of the story

No, Shooting first was the Biggest Win of this entire film, it perfectly encapsulates Han and is the smartest move the character could do as well, the anti-monologue subversion, instead of letting your enemy talk to just finish it. Not to mention that Beckett's commendation of the move works because Beckett sees himself in Han, he knows that he's been bested and even though he dies he's proud that he passed on his ideology so effectively

And I don't see the problem with a film being just good, why does every film have to be a colossal epic? Sometimes people just have a mood for different films, a laugh, an easy plot, just some fun you can appreciate, not everyone's gonna sit for the heavy political message or the cascading in your face 'look at all these visual effects' film that got nominated for an oscar.

It is difficult in some cases to even read for me, as writers are really good at displaying HATE and Death together, but at the same time I enjoy him as a villain because I know Obi-wan is his nemesis, and not the other way around, that I see Obi-wan in an even better light.

"Don't worry, the Corellia chase becomes so much more impressive when you find out they did almost all of it in camera, using CGI very sparingly.

Also, I think you really should have given this score much more credit.  I think it's one of the best Star Wars scores ever, and easily one of the best in years.  It has so much energy, is so fun, and just screams Star Wars.  If anyone could succeed the great John Williams for this series, I think John Powell would fit perfectly.  Him, or John Debney.

As for the cinematography, it's kind of grown on me.  Sure, it's still a little too dark and flat in some scenes, but I get what they were going for, and I don't mind it as much on rewatches as I did in the theaters.  I guess what I'm saying is that it's not as distracting after the first viewing.  Anyway, I love this film, it's really fun, and gives us another look at a galaxy far, far away.

I still go back to EU stories roughly once a month, but after that study I've officially quit Disney Star Wars.  

Regarding Solo, I was actually there opening night, with my ticket IN MY HAND, then I hit twitter and saw Jon Kasdan, the films script writer, was trolling fans on twitter who were critical of making Lando Pansexual.

"Great episode, as usual. I think the biggest, by far, problem with this movie was a) bad press (changing the directors, and beloved ones at that!) and worse yet b) the timing. I didn't watch it in cinema either. I watched Ep 7, 8 and Rogue One in cinema. But even though I liked Last Jedi, I just wasn't interested in another Star Wars movie. By the time the Blu-ray came out, I started getting interested in watching another one. In 2 to 3 months, I'd be excited. But damn, 5 months was not enough time. And they could have saved money AND made a better film if only they had aimed for a December release. Plus, by releasing it yet again in December, they'd condition people to want to watch a Star Wars movie for Christmas. Christmas isn't Christmas without Star Wars.

Basically, what was Disney thinking? It's not like they had another Star Wars movie lined up for this December. The next was due for NEXT Christmas. So why not put this in-between story right in the middle...

The movie itself was good. Entertaining, fun, well written (it seems like they started working on it while George Lucas was still heading it all?!). It feels like they were actually interested in the story, even if audiences weren't too interested.",20,8,2018-10-07T18:50:05.000Z,kada jawi,UCxSL_nWvKVIhoDCzEavanMA,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgzoPfzT_V8R0I3vizp4AaABAg

"Gotta say, bless your heart for finding positive aspects with stuff like this that most people seem to almost OBSESSIVELY want to hate every aspect of. I mean, sure, do I think it's a pointless movie no one asked for? Yes. Do I think it's bullshit they cast Alden Ehrenreich instead of Anthony Ingruber to play Han Solo? Yes.

But at the same time, I had a good time watching the movie. I enjoyed it, and it feels great to get different Star Wars movies like this one and Rogue One. And I really do hope that the Maul cameo here is forshadowing something. It would have been really awesome to see a movie where Maul appears in a more prominent role that takes place after Solo. Preferrably not another Han Solo movie though. Especially since it wouldn't make any sense if Han Solo met Maul, since he in A New Hope obviously never has seen a Jedi or Sith or any sign of the Force being a thing.

What I found a bit fascinating though is that you think Emilia Clarke was lackluster in this movie?

"While for me this movie really only outranks Episodes I and II and Rogue One (MAYBE Rogue One, kind of a toughie), it still far exceeded my expectations, which were really low. I genuinely liked it, but the Original Trilogy and Episode III are still my favorites, with the New Trilogy (thus far) trailing ever so slightly behind those. It's really hard for me to actually HATE anything Star Wars, and at worst, as with Episodes I and II, I only like it somewhat and just don't like certain aspects. Overall, Solo didn't have many faults I found outright deplorable (not even the ""SJW Agenda"" related stuff, which didn't bug me except as a gag that got old after a while, like when L3 responds to Lando asking her if she needs anything on the Falcon, and her response is ""Equal Rights?""), and like I said I really liked it, being probably one of the few Star Wars films that far exceeded my expectations. At this point, I don't know where Disney will go with the franchise after Episode IX, but I still don't think I'll hate anything they make thereafter; it just might become a little stale.",7,3,2018-10-07T18:47:39.000Z,deafghost52,UCZETUT1qlvfsP0nKuDdfWPg,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgyN6GUWTZYcLbH2g4l4AaABAg

"I liked the movie, but like it was addressed in the video it has this one major problem, which is that the movie is not truely a movie with heart in it. That and fatique of the Star Wars franchise probably makes people feel and think that the movie is so much more worse than it really is. Not a perfect or amazing movie, but also not a movie that should have flopped the way it did. We as fans and casual viewers just sort of get a bit too much Star Wars to put it simply out there. Especially as fans, when you have the clone wars, rebels, some video games and then movies that came out once a year, you'll notice this fatique. Especially with mixed quality between all these different productions. I mean who didn't feel a bit dissapointed in the plot of Battlefront 2 from last year if they played it? Got excited about about the Ending from Rebels, is super exited to get another, actual season for the Clone Wars, but goes back to Battlefront 1 and end up with no story at all? 

I hope people understand what I mean. The Fatique is real. Star Wars used to be something very special , even if Pre-Disney milked the brand themselves. They just didn't dialed it up to 11. With that bein said, I am still excited to see what the Mandalorian TV show will bring us. Considering the director for both the Clone Wars and Rebels is actually on board for that show!

"Thanks for this video. You gave me back a little bit of desire to watch this movie again since I left the cinema with a sense of disappointment. 
Main issue I had with this movie was trying to explain things that needed none. 
1) Why is he called Solo? It's just a name, usually given to you by your family. A surname from an offhand comment of a random NPC would've been fine for a couple of scenes, but *the* Solo from just ""well, you're alone?"" Cue Horatio Cane & sunglasses.
2) It's nitpicking, but it really irked me that the remark about Chewie needing a nickname because Chewbacca is too long stayed in the script. The moment he called him Chewie just because he had to adress him fast in a pinch was perfect even without that preceding proposition
3) Maul. Even if Qi'ra has to answer to somebody higher just because, why bring him. I don't mind so much that he's alive as that there's a force user in the movie at all. Don't get me wrong, I loved Rogue One, but for once I'd like a movie that has nothing to do with it. And this one was, right until that moment.

I'm assuming you haven't seen Me Before You, but it's a film where Clarke gets to portray a character without any malice or grand ambition and she was amazing.  You could definitely argue she was great in the way RDJ is great as Iron Man, because Clarke's personality in real life is quite similar to the personality of the character (who's also named Clarke) in Me Before You.

"This movie is a lot better than most people claim it to be. I believe it flopped because it got entangled with the backlash after 'The Last Jedi' (unfairly in my opinion). There where a lot of people advocating for boycotts, trashing Lucasfilm/Disney and that kind of nonsense. The movie have many flaws as the video pointed out but nothing that ruined my experience of enjoy it. I don't buy necessarily the theory of 'franchise fatigue'. If the movie is really good it will succeed no matter what. But if the movie is not that great (like in this case) then the combination of multiple factors can end in the flopping of the film. I wish there's a sequel to 'Solo' but I think it was a good decision of Disney to slow down the production of Star Wars movies and focus in Episode 9. For now we will have the two animated series, 'The Mandalorian' series, the comic books, novels, etc... After Episode 9 then Lucasfilm should reconsider its options a make more spin-offs movies like a 'Solo' sequel and a 'Kenobi' movie.

I mostly didn’t want to watch it because of the guy that they cast for Han. I thought there was another guy who would’ve been better, to play Han to the t. But I now realize that Han wasn’t meant to be perfect. This is his origin. If he was straight up the Han we know him as, we would still be left with the question of why is he the way he is.

"I really liked this movie. It’s not a cinematic masterpiece like others and is probably my third to last favorite Star Wars movie. But that just says how much I love Star Wars. I thought the performances were pretty good, the new characters were pretty neat (although L3 could be a little annoying sometimes I didn’t have a big problem with her), the action and cgi were flawless, and the story was pretty simple. Sometimes simple movies can be considered bad but it felt nice to have a a simple space adventure (especially compared to the last 3 which had much deeper stories). I’m very surprised you didn’t win that falcon scene where it’s being chased by the empire. I literally was wide-eyed when that theme from empire strikes back was playing during that part. So with that out of the way here are some movies I would like for you to do (at least ones that are currently available):

1. Star Wars the Last Jedi
2. OG Jurassic Park Trilogy
3. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom
4. The remaining Lord of the Rings movies
5. The Hobbit Trilogy
6. Pirates of the Caribbean Franchise
7. Indiana Jones Franchise 
8. The Fast and the Furious Franchise 
9. Toy Story Trilogy
10. The Lion King
11. Wall-E
12. How to Train your Dragon 2
13. Kung Fu Panda 1+3
14. Shrek 
15. Live-action Cinderella
16. Live-action and animated Beauty and the Beast
17. The Tim Burton Batman Movies
18. The Nightmare before Christmas 
19. The Hunchback of Norte Dame
20. The LEGO Ninjago Movie
21. Mary Poppins
22. Either just Creed or the whole Rocky Franchise
23. Meet the Robinsons

Or maybe a challenge round?

1. The Emoji Movie
2. The Bee Movie
3. Batman Forever
4. Fantastic Four (2005-2007)
5. Green Lantern
6. Catwoman

"So, you did the ""Solo"", er, solo film first. A surprise to be sure, but a welcomed one! Joking aside, I'm glad you did. This film is far from perfect but many things about it are great. Yes, the fan-service kind of got out of hand (although I remember myself chuckling and having a Steve Rogers face [you know the one] quite often). Yes, the name giving scene was really silly. Yes, him convincing Dreyden so easily was really stupid (it could be Qi'ra that did the talking and making the saving throws, it would make her character more vital). And yes, while both stories are good, the connection between them isn't the best.
But it's a good film. Not a great one, but good. As Qi'ra put it best: ""You look good. A little rough around the edges, but good"". Personally, I even appreciate the dark/grimmy look, it seems really appropriate for the criminal underworld of the Star Wars Universe. Although I'd still love to see what Phil Lord and Christopher Miller had in mind for the film.

3. After the prequels trilogy, they destroyed Lucas, hating on him and accusing him for ruining their childhood.
4. After years of bullying, Lucas sold Star Wars to Disney, and people accusing Disney for ruining his vision and disrespect him. 
5. After Force Awaken, people hating on JJ Abram.
6. After The Last Jedi, people hating on Disney for ruining Star Wars, and want Lucas to come back.

"Although I did enjoy Solo, I think it was missing one important thing that Star Wars movies need: a Light Saber battle. Unfortunately, while the idea of the Jedi and the Sith being all but extinct worked for one movie, once it got expanded to a franchise, having so few people fighting with light sabers because a definite problem. This is the one place where the prequels actually beat the originals - well choreographed Light Saber duels - Duel of the Fates, Obi Wan vs Anakin... even if the rest of the movie is a steaming pile of Banta podo, those scenes are enough to get me to pop them in the blu ray player. I think one of the things that really hurt The Last Jedi was that you never had a real light saber clash. After Episode IX, I hope they do a time skip before episode X, with Rey and Kylo Ren having built up new Jedi and Sith orders, with the galaxy torn between the two.

Honestly, if they had made a Kenobi movie (starring Ewan McGregor), we would not be having a discussion about why Solo flopped. Sadly, I think the cameo by Darth Maul was foreshadowing for that film, which now may never happen. That's a shame, because I think my reaction to a Kenobi movie would have been shared by a lot of people (by the way, my reaction is ""Shut up and take my money!"").",0,9,2018-10-07T17:23:10.000Z,Kyon2261,UC8ErmIZPH0TjnSMaZqGpKeQ,UImXWiDFAoE,True,UgwSe3qpDHi6lcznYh94AaABAg
"You were not excited for this movie but I was and I was squeeling of joy because I could go see this movie and I had soooo much fun. It was one of the best Star Wars movies for me.

And I still believe it's not fully that people don't care but fans are getting back to the same shit happening when prequels appeared. ""I will not see this because it doesn't exists for me"". And that's sad because I love those movies

To the 'being pissed they killed Rio"", can I remind you one meaningful for me scene from the Rogue One? Cassian Andor shooting a guy who helped him because loose ends are dangerous. Because we have here pretty much one of first groups of rebels, it doesn't mean they will not kill for the case. They want to live and people are the most important assets. They want to live. I couldn't really blame anyone for Rio's death. It was unfortunate result of conflict but Rio was shooting too.

"Definitely the weakest of the newer movies for me, but even then it's still a fun, worthwhile and enjoyable ride, my real issue is how it felt predictable, like a checklist of Han moments. TFA, Rogue One and TLJ all took me on a emotional ride where I was crying (Good crying) and smiling not knowing what'll happen next (Yep, even for Rogue One), for this I was just smiling, not that that's bad but a step down from the previous 3.  Still, there's plenty to like in this film, it's a treasure trove for canon (And Legends) junkies that's a fun ride while giving us a good ""faux"" villain and cool new element to the Star Wars Underworld. Like I said, definitely the weakest of the new films and about mid-level for the entire saga, but I don't regret seeing it.

"May i point out that L3-37 spells out ""leet"" in leet speak. Not sure if was intentional nor do i understand why it was there but it exists.

Anyway I don't dislike the new movies but I feel almost as if they don't have any purpose. I also feel like we've been focusing on the good guys too much. I feel like the Side Story should be used to talk about things completely unrelated to the Rebellion or the Civil War. The Mandalorian seems to be going in that direction and I'd really love a Star Wars story about just your normal Stormtrooper without them turning to the Rebellion. A movie humanizing the Empire would be great.

 personally I just think something unrelated to the main line films in both character and narrative would be good.

"I liked their ""opening crawl""
in this movie it sets up the time the movie is living in and where we will pick up. Alden Ehrenrich is so good as Han. I would love to know if Han and Qi'Ra ever met again. I think it would be interesting if they actually didn't meet again until after Return of the Jedi or just never met again, Qi'Ra went up  in the ranks in Crimson Dawn (maybe even taking Mauls spot after he died in Rebels). And we know what happens to Han.

Also I don't mind Han choosing the name Solo because he's alone but don't make an imperial guard do it. I would've made him do it at the end of this movie and be like I'm alone.

Enfys Nest is one of my favourite parts of the movie the reveal of the different alien species all uniting to start something. Got me smiling and when they said a Rebellion I just couldn't anymore.

These things take time, you know? I wanted to watch it a few times and give it a little room to breathe in my brain, because I didn't just want to throw it out there without thinking about every side. It was never even a question, I started writing the script the day I saw it in theatres. The delay has absolutely nothing to do with the hate surrounding it. When has that ever bothered me? I did The Last Airbender and Batman v Superman. There's a lot of factors as to why I do certain videos at certain times. But, look, it's coming. I keep pushing the date back because I'm not happy with the script but I will do it before the end of the year. Pinky Promise.

"Referring to your observation about the New Yorkers from the first movie: It was meant to be a small feel-good moment for American moviegoers at the time; especially those from New York. Spiderman 1 was released one year after 9/11. If you remember, the original teaser trailer featured bank robbers in a helicopter getting trapped in a giant web between the Towers; the film most likely wasn't finished filming yet.

"I think that they should let the whole Iron Man thing lay low for a while if this ends up happening and eventually bring in Ironheart from the comics in the future. T'Challa's sister is fine as her own thing. I know everyone wants Bucky and I don't mind him, but I personally want to see Falcon become the new Captain America. Let's face it, Loki will be back. Loki is like Spike from 'Buffy', he'll always pop up somehow. As much as I love my Guardians, I think Mantis might be the one from that group to go. I also have another theory that I like to add to your theory. Thanks to Disney buying Fox and the failure of 'Venom' (which could hopefully result in Sony finally giving up the remaining Spiderman rights to Marvel Studios after 'Into The Spider-Verse), there are three new things that are definitely going to happen after the 'Avengers 4': The definitive 'Fantastic Four', MCU's 'X-Men', and more marketable villains for Spidey (i.e. Doc Ock, Electro, Black Cat, my personal favorite: The Green Goblin, and eventually the Sinister Six). Let's say that the way some of the dead characters ""reintegrate"" results in a change in DNA for the select few, which could result in both the age of mutants as well as a more understandable and less convoluted way for the Four to emerge. As for the 'Avengers' property itself? That's not going to go anywhere but the next big End Of Phase movie should NOT be 'Avengers 5'. In other words, give the fans a moment to grieve, so to speak. But when they do finally bring the Avengers Initiative back, I would like to see Captain Marvel, Spiderman, Ant-Man, Luke Cage and The Wasp as ""The New Avengers"".",0,0,2018-10-07T01:51:02.000Z,Shane Moose,UCu2WcXryZZkNZ6pSJXfp_xA,y3j8v-MHGtQ,True,UgyRCRHKuiunG0Epdit4AaABAg

"I think the reason the adults don't have more emotion characters is because A) each basic emotion character covers more than just Sad, Disgust, Anger, Fear, and Joy and B) it would undermine how Joy has to learn to work WITH Sadness, since each emotion comes together with another one to make a different one, like curiosity (which could be a combination of joy and fear) or embarrassment (sadness and disgust, due to the kind of role Disgust was given) or bittersweet (sadness and happiness).

"Perhaps this is one movie you should revisit for Cinemas Wins. There is much more going on than this brief video would suggest. The optimism in the movie, was what surprised me about it, and how the protagonist sticks to her guns no matter what. Also the fact that she is a girl would be a positive role model for other girls. Adult Frank's relationship with Athena was more of a regretful, longing, like when you re-connect with someone you loved from your past. But now, time has moved on, people have changed, yet the closeness is there. Plus, she's an ageless robot, so not actually a little girl, and nothing ""creepy"" happens.
There's is much more I think can be touched upon. So feel free to revisit this one like your did San Andreas.
Thanks.

"Also I feel like it should be noted that throwing the kryptonite spear at Doomsday would have never worked. Wonder Woman is way too busy putting all of her effort into restraining Doomsday with her lasso, Batman would not have been able to throw it through Doomsday because he was too far away and lacks the strength to put Doomsday down by throwing it into him from that distance plus if he got too close trying to impale Doomsday with the spear Doomsday would’ve impaled and killed Batman before he could do any real damage, and finally Superman also lacked the strength to throw the spear hard enough into Doomsday because of the kryptonite. And just because he’s flying doesn’t mean he’d be able to throw the spear hard enough into Doomsday. Superman knows he’s weakened and I really doubt he’ll risk letting something like Doomsday live by missing the throw or not having enough power. Plus Superman is putting all of his effort into flying and he is going waaaaay slower than normal. But after he got close enough he was able to focus on his strength rather than his flying so he had a much better chance of killing Doomsday, and even then he had to push himself to his absolute limit until he finally died after killing Doomsday.

"I want CinemaSins to make a video of how hatred this movie fail at the box office and everything how WB didn't use all the faithful source material from the comics because of the film's terrible reshoots - overuse of CGI, its convoluted plot, the main villain being underdeveloped and more of how the movie has miserably fail to impress me.

Also, WB is terrible at this film, I meant, look Steppenwolf's appearance in the film, what in the hell is supposed to look like 'cause that's NOT how he looks like in the comics. Additional scenes and writing for Joss Whedon's direction is just so wasted.

I'm watched the movie last year and it became as the worst DC films. This movie would've given a darker tone rather than being lighter I meant, the film's runtime is just too short for 2 hrs. Too many continuity errors and too much plotholes as well for too much editing on the film's CGI, action scenes, the characters' performances (not enough screentime), its script, confused writing/pacing and many of the film's troubled production process. It's all Warner Bros' fault, they don't give a f*cking damn to look back of their mistakes from their past films even for DC miscellaneous movies.

"If avengers 4 is going to be more about Cap, can we have an EGA Push prior to it coming out? Just for kicks?

I think Cap will die too. I just feel that walking away from the shield isn’t his style. He is a leader and a patriot, for humanity, not just the US. I can’t see there being anything that makes him just give up. I think he will see Ironman going off to do something self-sacrificial and won’t want him to be alone. 

With regards to other characters taking on the roles or, at least, names, I will echo others and say I donut want to see it, at least with Ironman. As he has said from he first movie, Tony Stark is Ironman. Someone else should be someone else, even if they fill a similar shoe. Re Cap, he never really took it on in the same way so I could see someone else taking role but why would they. I don’t want a reboot but I would also happily watch the adventures of Bucky or the winter soldier, without them calling themselves captain america, even if they have the shield.

Love the movie but not a fan of the way Batman is portrayed. They seem to want to make him a poor man's version of Iron Man because he depends on his suit and gadgets too much. Batman is the worlds greatest detective and they don't show that. Batman is the world's greatest hand to hand combatant and they don't show that. He should put Sherlock Holmes to shame and just by watching him fight you should instantly know he could beat Chuck Norris in the ring.

LotR is my favorite because while they do cut things out, it really is extra stuff you don't need for a great story, or when they move stuff around it actually makes more sense where they put it in the movies vs where it was in the book.

"The ""I do not know the way"" line deserves way more attention. 
It's not simply honesty, but heartbreaking innocence. This poor little guy was ripped out of his safe home by powers he does not understand, nearly died on his way here and yet here he is - standing up and trying to do the right thing not even knowing what dangers and hardships this will include. 
Frodo is so afraid yet desperate to just help - it's really a huge step for his character. 
And all these brave warriors stop their ferocious tittle-tattle to look at this young hobbit who just put them all to shame by his simple desire to do the right thing. All the while they were arguing about prejudice and power and politics and who-knows-what and by the time probably just for the sake of it.

I am a few days late so this will get missed in the comments and you won't see it. But one of the fun things about this being filmed in NZ is the eagles. Now let me clarify that. In New Zealand we had up until around the 1600s a species of eagle called the Haast Eagle and it was giant. So big it would hunt the Moa that giant bird that often gets put into fantasy and sci-fi. Now before anyone laments the loss of the Haast Eagle and wishes it was still around so we could use real eagles for these films I would like to point out on small detail. The Haast Eagle ate people. Which shouldn't be too much of a surprise given it ate the Moa which is way bigger than you or me. But no on these here islands up until the early modern age we had giant man eating birds.  New Zealand being Middle Earth doesn't seems to silly now does it?,1,0,2018-10-04T23:06:54.000Z,Gowan James Ditchburn,UChjbstNoGxVp8-RJYDg5SIQ,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgwEtWG7qp8phua4C9d4AaABAg

"It's nice to see someone defend this movie rather than jump on the hate train. Honestly, I don't understand the hate this movie or the third one gets. Honestly, the second one, I didn't really care for the love story, but it was a good when it got to the action. Good movies get so ruined by internet hate. This is why I sorta wish we didn't have such hateful people when it came to reviewing movies and everyone would just form their own opinion instead of relying on others. 

On that note, I DO hate how much hate the kid who played young Anakin got.... He played the part he was given perfectly, and got hated for it. Everyone blames him for ruining the first movie, but honestly, the problem with the Tatooine thing wasn't Anakin, but the fact that particular part of the movie seemed like it took far too long to get through. But honestly, that didn't make it a bad movie, or make Anakin a bad character. It was always really annoying how this movie got so much hate, despite the fact it's a good movie. Most people, if you ask why, they just bring up crap that other people have said about it and show how they don't really understand the movie or they actually never watched it.

And also on that note... I wasn't sure why they killed Maul in this movie... I personally think Maul would have been a better final villain for Anakin to overcome before becoming Vader than Dooku. Cause Anakin would have had a reason to hate Maul after finding out that Maul killed Qui-gon. That could have been a whole revenge arc there, with Anakin fighting with Obi-wan over it because Anakin will want revenge, but Obi-wan just wants to bring him to justice. There was so much wasted opportunity in Maul. Luckily though, we got him in Clone Wars and Rebels... But they still missed a lot of opportunities. Like never giving us a Maul/Anakin encounter, and no Maul/Vader encounter in Rebels. I would have loved to see Maul and Savage Oppress fight Anakin and Obi-wan. THAT would have made a great ""final"" fight for Maul and Oppress. Or seeing Maul try to fight Vader and lose, further showing how powerful Vader is over other sith of the past. Dooku was great, don't get me wrong, and Christopher Lee is a freaking legend, but as good as his character was, they didn't really capitalize well on the whole ""Dooku was Quigon's master"" thing... That was a fact we all forgot by the end of Episode 2.",0,0,2018-10-04T19:43:51.000Z,Hei Darkfire,UCtEsVwHP0Ahw1qQYrANPkIg,QppINK042N8,True,Ugw8USdyAzLrly_FHRd4AaABAg

"I don't get the deal about extended editions. You will often find those scenes redundant or not done/acted well enough, which is why they were cut out of a movie. Yeah, it's bad when you cut a proper film down/ask for it to fit a runtime like WB did with Justice League, but when the theatrical version comes out, that's the film the praise and hate should be based on. Never understood how someone can say ""the extended edition is the right version people need to watch"", especially when it's about movies like Batman v Superman which weren't dissed just because they cut things out. The final cut that hits theaters should be the only one considered. Extended editions are great for fans, but regular viewers aren't expected to see them.

"Phantom Menace is a good film if you're a kid discovering the SW universe for the first time, I watched it as a 9 year old in the cinema and it really hooked me, however as a film and precursor to the original trilogy it leaves a lot to be desired for various reasons. Attack of the Clones doesn't add an awful lot with regards to plot advancement, but there is definite character development, especially with regards to Anakin and Obi Wan, despite how unengaging the romance was between Anakin and Padme, plus there some absolutely sick action scenes, I remember LOVING the lightsaber action on Geonosis, especially the duel between Dooku and Yoda, that left me with the biggest smile on my face as a kid.

A father doesnt become envious of their son when they're potential for success gets higher and higher and their ego gets bigger. They're scared they wont make the right decision for them and they want to hold them back so they can control the decisions and set them on the right path. While not the wisest decision, Obi Wan was fearful of what Anikan would do with his power and letting down Qui Gon causing him to be arrogant to hold Anikan back so he diesnt make the wrong decision. He wasnt an envious ungrateful master as much as he was trying to set Anikan on the path he thought was right.

"Whoa whoa whoa! First off, the extended editions are a lot better than you really give them credit for. They add so much more to the movie in terms of action, settings, story and characters. Should've mentioned before but Aragorns visiting his mother's (Gilrean) memorial and the weight of who he is. The extended version of Gandalf talking about the Mithril shirt is a super win, 1 the scene is amazing and shows just just another brief moment of the vastness of Moria 2 It gives Frodo the weighted burden that now he has the whole worth of the Shire (and everything in it) on his chest.The Fellowship receiving their gifts from Galadriel and the important relationship moment between Gimli and Legolas starting to become friends and tear down the walls that separate their two races. When Aragorn fights Lurtz and Lurtz throws the dagger (after licking it Brutal) it was a real dagger and Aragorn deflecting it and that sound was amazing. Also during Boromir's last stand they edit out the Hobbits throwing stones at the Uruk's inventive.

"I was completely shellshocked when I saw this movie for the very first time. By some miracle I missed most spoilers and only knew Wanda was gonna to die/disappear. (I saw it a few weeks after it came out.) Immediately after the snap I knew we were all going to cry but still. Hearing Bucky’s quiet confused ‘Steve?’ before he literally turned to dust before our eyes to Okoye helping T’Challa up only for him to literally disintegrate in her arms was just absolutely mind-numbing. Tears were streaming down my face throughout the Wakanda snap scenes. And then, of course, the Titan snap scenes. Being that Peter P and Tony are my two favorite characters in the MCU and I absolutely love their father/son relationship, it was so gut-wrenching to see Peter cling to Tony, trying to prevent his inevitable disappearance and just plea for his life. And the effect you can see it has on Tony, it’s so alike the face he made after he thought he lost Pepper in Iron Man 3. He loves this kid and he suddenly lost him, as well as a bunch of other teammates, knowing that he could have prevented it. 

Just holy shit. I was full-on sobbing at this point and had to reassure myself that it was okay, Peter would be back, he has a sequel, he’ll be fine, he’s coming back, for the next 20 minutes. 

(Also nothing against Peter Q for messing up the plan on Titan, it was completely in character and believable. He’s another one of my favorites from the MCU.)

This movie was a cinematic masterpiece and there is nothing that can convince me otherwise. They risked so many things, SO MANY THINGS, and it was beautiful. No matter how much it killed us, it was probably the best MCU film until Avengers 4.

"I'm a life-long Trekkie from a family of Trekkies. So when I first saw this movie (and the second) I LOVED them as action-scifi. But as Star Trek movies...I was (and still am) a bit more mixed, although the negative feelings are muted by knowing that the flashy-ness and combat of this movie not only broadened it's appeal, but showed us a side of Trek that just couldn't be done in the past. Because of simple technology for TOS and TNG, and budgetary reasons in the more recent ones (well, and still tech to some extent).

"Ok. So, here's my theory about how they're gonna wrap up phase 4. There were some Easter eggs that stood out to me that may give away the next movie.

So, we all know Captain Marvel becomes a player in the next film, but I think that while she's keeping Thanos on the ropes, It's going to be a few other key players that will bring post snap people back. 

1. Shuri has stored info about the mind stone that she can create a way to locate the rest they'll need. She, Tony and Bruce will go do the brain thing and work it out.

2. Vision is dead, but his body didn't leave. This may mean they will be working something out with trying to connect him with the stone again. Bruce pointed out that his genetic make up is a combo of himself, Tony, Ultron and the stone.

3. The extra gauntlet that was already forged on the elf planet. Thor will need to retrieve it so they can attach the stones again.

4. Thanos mentioned having strong conviction to wield the power of the stones ( or something around that effect). Even if he's wrong, he has strong conviction in his belief. Which leads me to #5.

5. Captain America. Who among the Avengers has more conviction in his beliefs about good prevailing over evil, and a strong hatred for bullies, like Steve Rogers? He almost picked up Thor's hammer in Age of Ultron. Personally, I think Odin's spell cast over it for anyone worthy, was trickery of words for an Asgardian worthy man. The ruin sigil on Its side lit up when he whispered the words into it. But I digress....
Since Evans is not slotted into a new contract to carry on into the next generation phase, he will be the one to wear the gauntlet and sacrifice his life.

Why? Since his first movie, bread crumbs of his character has been leading up to his big goodbye. When he was regular Steve Rogers, he refused to take rejection for not going into war to fight back the bullies...A reference he did when he challenged Loki about facing off with someone else like Loki the last time he stood in that foreign soil. 

He threw himself on what he believed to be a live grenade to save his platoon. This was a callback reference in the first Avengers when having words with Tony when Loki's septor got everybody heated. 

Thanos' arm was burned up from using the gauntlet, and he was clearly hurt from the stumbling. He was a very strong Alien Titan. 
Although Steve is enhanced, and can regenerate, he can't withstand such cosmic size power, like Thor enduring the blasts from a star. He will be completely consumed and burn up once he makes the snap. Lives will be saved. One of the next generations will take his place as leader: Cpt. Marvel, Sam, Bucky, or T'Challa. 

Now for some fun predictions of crazy scenarios: 

6. I think Tony will go find that black female teen protégé to take his place(like in the comics), while he does his part time Jarvis routine as aid to her, so he and Pepper get married and try for a family. That'll get RDJ out of his contract.

7. Shuri will step down her role as temporary Black Panther and Queen when her brother comes back. 

8. The next Guardians movie may be about a quest to finding a way to get Gamora's soul out of the stone.

9. Thor will have met up with the Valkyrie(I wish they'd give her character an actual name already. I'm getting flashbacks to HEROES with ""The Haitian"" who didn't get a a damn name til season 4...I digress) that escaped with the other half of the Asgardians in Norway, where she settled them in. I'm hoping she gets to fight in the next Avengers movie, and they have:  Okoye, Nakia, Shuri and the Wakandan warriors spotlighted like they truly screwed over because the studio underestimated how big Black Panther was going to be, since Infinity War was in the can first. I was highly irritated with that down play, so only Black Widow and Wanda got a shine. Always bet on black, damn it! I digress. Loki pulled the biggest okey doke on Thanos, and pops back up stronger in his magic since he went to study more and be a better master of it, like comic book Loki. 

10. Bruce has a mild separations from Hulk so he can have a life of his own for awhile.

11. Bucky suits up and is ready to get on the team, in honor of his best bro....😪

12. Ant man and Wasp help save the day with the Avengers also, which brings back Hank and Scott's daughter ( NO SPOILERS, PLEASE....I HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR MOVIE YET) I'm just gonna assume Cassie and Hank disappear at the end of it. Their super shrink thing comes in handy somehow. 

And just for kicks, I'll say at the end Captain Marvel meets a young New Orleans girl named Marie, who accidentally absorbs her powers. ENTER THE MUTANTS INTO THE DISNEY TENT. 😁",13,4,2018-10-03T14:16:49.000Z,blackkatt777,UCv8JydtaS0OhzytINwb18Xw,ysEZYyXDXIU,True,Ugz4oMby0wM-nTAaTdN4AaABAg

So I was only about 4 when these movies came out but even when I got old enough to watch them I wasn't all that interested. True story I would watch any battle scenes and any scenes with Legolas. But in 12th grade I had to watch this for a film class and kind of fell in love.

"Man, do you need to reread the books. And yes, I was probably born at least twenty years before you, but I read them in high school, and the books had the same profound impact on myself and my friends who also read them at the same time (because my English teacher assigned The Hobbit, and encouraged us to keep on going with LotR directly after) as the movies probably had on you and your friends.

But the thing is, it's only in rereading that you begin to see all the depth to the world that Tolkien created and was missed (or purposely left out) even by the fanatics of Jackson's crew. I loved Bombadil, and I still do. He's basically Gandalf if Gandalf wasn't tasked with being the steward of the world. Bombadil does what all the Maiar do. Build a realm, and jealously guard it. (Sauron, Saruman, the Balrog, and the elves take after them). Sure, Gandalf doesn't talk in meter, but otherwise they're very similar. I don't fault Jackson for leaving out Bombadil, but leaving out the lineage of Merry's sword is a bit of a problem. (Also, I wanted Boromir to foreshadow the fact that he has a brother, like he did in the book, and I was disappointed that he didn't in the movie.)

I'm not arguing that the movies aren't great. They are. But I am arguing that the fact that you minimized the book in your eagerness to praise the movies, isn't fair to them. And I really think you need a reread to discover (or rediscover) that.",0,0,2018-10-03T07:09:32.000Z,Kaguya,UCQ8I7zK_VlKz4EOL46iQ-6w,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgwnC6-zTRGyplagS-F4AaABAg

"So I have a couple things I want to talk about regarding this movie. I absolutely adore the trilogy and it's one of my all time favorite movie series ever. These movies were released when I was very very little. When Fellowship was released, I was 4 years old. But I still remember watching it on VHS when it came out, and remember being absolutely fascinated by the story and all the detail.  I grew up watching the movies, even though for the most part I didn't really understand what was happening. Boromirs death at the end had a big impact on me, even though I didn't really understand at that point what had happened. I loved the music, was mystified by the elves and their culture and grew up wanting to look like Arwen 😁 its these movies that have had a tremendous impact on how I place my values. I grew up thinking I needed to be strong and fearless to accomplish my goals, and that sometimes things are hard, but to place value in my friendships. So I get massive nostalgia everytime I hear the music or watch the films. This next part is kind of an aside, and doesn't really have to do with the Fellowship, but could you please at least win the extended edition of Return of the King? I know it's a long movie, I believe the longest out of the lot, but it really puts in a lot more detail and makes more cohesive sense than the theatrical release does. I know most of my favorite scene, where Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli all go into the mountain to recruit, is majorly cut in the rheatrical. It also kind of rounds everything out better. The extended for Fellowship isn't all that different from the theatrical, but there are some massive differences with Return of the King.",0,0,2018-10-03T06:53:12.000Z,Arian Searcy,UCFBjMC4RSfzuNrPrsPcC2lQ,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgxsOop5b_ZCNGA0pRh4AaABAg

"You know, I just want to point out... yeah, once you know the relationship, seeing Leia kiss Luke IS kind of gross. But that requires you to know (George, I'm looking at you).

When you don't know, when you're watching it for the first time, or Luke and Leia, it's totally innocent in A New Hope (and  honestly kind of expected, based on 'hero's adventure tropes'). In Empire, it's a lot less innocent, at least for Leia, who is deliberately annoying Han by kissing Luke, but even Luke looks kind of stunned like 'Wow, did she really just do that?' We also get further confirmation that 'okay, a few years have gone by, their relationships have progressed.

I'm just saying, in those two movies, the kissing works.

Then in Jedi, it does feel a bit weird with 'Wait, they're siblings? But they kissed!.... WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ALWAYS KNEW?! AND YOU STILL KISSED?!?!?!' My response is more along the lines that it took a combination of the reveal and Leia realizing that she has the Force too, that that's how she made the connection. Leia is established as someone who, despite having access to the force, she never develops it, and that hurts her ability to make the familial connection. I can see where there might be some confusion of familial affection for romance...... I don't think it's handled maybe the best, but it's okay, at least considering it's a topic that is barely addressed in 3 minutes worth of scenes in a handful of movies with kids in mind.

"Honestly, I don't find the Harry / Ginny and Hermione / Ron romance to be as weird as many people think.
Sure, Harry and Hermione are fan favorites but that's about it. Most of what actually happens in the books or movies points out to the conclusion we get.
Ginny being so obsessed with Harry that she can't even talk to him, and then building confidence to act normally, Ron and Hermione constantly bickering (kind of a Han / Leia relationship at first)...
Seems logical to me. There are only three parts in the entire saga where Harry and Hermione's personal relationship is developed (Goblet of Fire when Ron and Harry don't speak to each other, Half Blood Prince when Ron is dating Lavender and Deathly Hallows when Ron left), and it's made pretty clear in these occasions that while they are good friends, it doesn't go further than that.

"I loved that scene where Odin strips Thor of his title. I was even more amazed when I found out the entire scene was improvised by Anthony Hopkins. The scene was entirely different in the script.

And his cape. He then utters the ""Your are not worthy."" but not in a loud booming voice, but in the voice of a broken father who is casting out his son. And then the hammer just falls out of his hand onto the floor cause Thor couldn't lift it anymore. After they shot that scene, Hopkins asked if they could go one more time, and the second the camera starts rolling, he just let's out that amazing speech and Tom Hiddleston butted in on a whim to try and make the scene better and Hopkins just jumped down his throat like hot coffee.

"Here's my theory : the beginning is real. The asylum is real. We see the first couple of days of baby dolls life there before jumping to the lobotomy. It's at this time that baby doll thinks back on her last few days at the asylum but her memory is fantasied. The worst parts of her memory (ie rape and the sex to further her goals) is fantasied further to help her cope by imagining herself in a situation with control. Eventually, it leads to her lobotomy which is percieved by herself as freedom from the guilt over the death of her sister and rocket who she latched onto as a serrogate sister. Here's the cool part- sweet pea was never real. She's baby dolls interpretation of her own Psych. Her own mind. The part of her that, thanks to the lobotomy is set free. Madam gorski says at the end that she helped another inmate escape. But she wasn't talking about sweet pea. She's covering up the death of rocket at the hands of her employee the cook. The other two girls killed by blue in the fantasy were either killed by blue in real life and covered up or perhaps transferred by blue, or lobotomized by him etc and so wasn't mentioned at the end as miss gowski didn't relate whatever happened to them as anything to do with baby doll whose behaviour was blamed for tickets death.

"Yeah, no. The descend into the dark side of Anakin is not well presented. His turning point is abrupt, you cannot go from ""my god what have I done!"" to ""I'll do everything you say"" in literally two seconds. The failures of the jedi are not shown, just implied. I mean, yes, Windu is kind of a dick, but he is in no way a scheming villain like Sidious, and anyone who's not being manipulated by Sidious should be able to see that. What they should have shown us is some examples of how the jedi council failed on its own, with no help by any outsider. And it's been done, quite masterfully, with the finale of The Clone Wars and the cowardly, disgraceful treatment of Ashoka. That, I feel, is a crucial moment of disenchantment for Anakin, far more powerful and important than anything shown here. And, even beyond that, you can't take three films to go from hopeful jedi to reluctant sith, and then three SCENES to go from reluctant sith to murderous power-hungry psychopath.

"I was thinking watching the videos might remind me of why I used to love at least the first movie in the LotR trilogy, if not its entirety. Get me to check them out again. Doesn't seem so.

It's absolutely not the movies' fault, but even though I saw them all in the cinema as a teenager, and really, REALLY liked at least the first two, I have not seen any of them since. And the videos about what is ostensibly great about them, weirdly enough, just remind me why I don't want to see them ever again. I know they're great movies, but I literally get physically tired just watching the clips from there. They're too long, too dark, too heavy for me. ""Fellowship"" is something I might watch again, but mostly because I love the portrayal of Hobbiton. The epic battles later in the movie and in the sequels, the quest with the One Ring, everything - I just don't think I'd care at all if I watched the movies again. I'm probably one of like five people on the planet to think so, but I think the trilogy is just so self-important and full of faux pathos.

Plus, there are just things I find intolerable. Things I hated even on the first viewing, but didn't spoil the whole for me. Things that somehow stuck in my memory much, much more than what was great about the films. Gimli is almost literally a joke in the movies. Mortensen as Aragorn just never worked for me, he's just so unlike how I pictured the character in my head that I find him unconvincing and dull as dishwater. And Legolas gradually turning into an insufferable Mary Sue character, especially contrasted with the pathetic and stupid Gimli (first movie is not so bad. The rest? Oh boy). All small gripes that made me never want to see again movies that, on paper, are perfect for what I want out of a fantasy epic. I just can't bring myself to care about any of this.

And somehow, the movies managed to sour me on the book version as well. I first read ""Lord of the Rings"" as a kid, I think I was 10 or thereabouts. Loved it back then, I instantly got turned into a fantasy nerd for life xP. I watched the first movie a few years later, I think; I decided to go back to the book a few years ago. I managed to get through maybe 100 pages before giving up with a resigned sigh and the only thought I had being ""this is so boring"".

The mere mention of the movies' titles has so much of an inexplicable effect of making me tired and quasi-depressed that I'm probably the only person I know that actually kinda liked the first ""Hobbit"" movie, despite it being objectively not even in the same league as the LotR movies. But at least it was entertaining. It was an adventure. It wasn't the cinematic equivalent of an epic orchestral score blasting at full volume, telling you ""LOOK AT HOW IMPORTANT ALL THIS IS"".

Again, ""Fellowship"" was probably my favourite movie of the trilogy, because of the pastoral, serene Hobbiton and the small scale of the adventure, the fun Gandalf, the feeling of adventure. But the latter two movies somehow managed to spoil this memory for me. And the two videos on CinemaWins kinda made me take a high-speed journey through that entire mental process and the few years in which I originally watched all three films. Hence the rant.

And again - I know the movies are objectively well-made, they have some amazing actors, and they're based on pretty good source material (I mean, story-wise I think LotR is overrated to an extent, but it IS one of the creators of an entire genre, and that counts for a lot. Plus, Tolkien was amazing at world-building, and his linguistic geekery appeals to me a lot, being interested in the stuff myself, both personally and professionally). I totally get why people love the movies. I just wish I could get past the feeling of carrying a heavy and unwieldy object when I see a clip from one of the movies, or hear a few notes from the musical score. Because I don't know, maybe I would appreciate at least the first movie if I forced myself to watch it again. The fact that I have to use the word ""forced"" in this context is the key point, though.",0,0,2018-10-02T17:06:58.000Z,Michael Sporzynski,UCSANYlTmX74-gjXljHIpCCg,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,Ugztq-3Qo3gRHydmyX54AaABAg

"The reason why the Power stone removal from Nova Corps on Xander wasn't shown: None of our principal heroes were on Xander at the time, so there would be close to zero audience investment in such scenes, making for a slow start to the movie.

"Considering how much you love this movie (as do I), I'm going to chalk it up to you just having so many things to put here, but I was genuinely shocked you didn't put in Aragorn deflecting Lurtz's dagger. Because that wasn't a trick. That was actually Viggo Mortensen deflecting a dagger thrown directly at him by Lawrence Makoare, because Makoare couldn't see shit in all the makeup and costume.

"My girlfriend hadn't seen any Star Wars movie when we started dating (after Force Awakens, before Rogue One). I was discussing plot twists in various movies one day, and she didn't know any of the references I was making. When I realized she didn't know Star Wars, I was shocked. I wasn't officially a fan of the series myself until Force Awakens... I grew up enjoying mostly the music and Yoda, always happy to watch the movies, but never going out of my way to do so. But NOT knowing ""No, *I* am your father"" was too much for me. I pulled up the scene on YouTube, beginning with the light saber duel. I kept watching her reactions as it went, and she was on the edge of her seat by the time Vader delivered the famous line. Luke fell to escape Vader, and she said ""we need to watch these movies."" 
We now have a 3.5 month old son, and I've been making a long list of movies I need to show him some day. I've been contemplating the order in which to show him the movies also. With his mom, we watched IV, V, VI, I, II, III. I discussed Machete Order (I would never exclude Phantom Menace though, if only for Darth Maul and Duel of the Fates), but when it came to actually watching them, she really just wanted to finish the original trilogy since she was so into it. Since she's caught up, we watched them in episodic order to prepare for Last Jedi, but that should never be the first way someone watches the movies... the reveals of Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor all lose their power if you've watched the prequels before the originals. If he's invested enough in the story when it comes the time, I'll probably show him IV, V, I, II, III, VI. Like I said, I like the idea of Machete Order, but I'll never cut out Phantom Menace if only for the genius that is John Williams.",0,0,2018-10-02T14:02:31.000Z,R Nickerson,UCwXmSLH7-BggtKBzKFAVY2A,DbhOBrBGULE,True,Ugy0gUqCWU-Mox5-DRR4AaABAg

"What made this trilogy was that the whole production was a labor of love.  Almost everyone revered the source material, and those who didn't got wrapped up in the excitement of those who did.  All the people making the money calls were less about the money and more about doing it right.  

Your dismissal of Tom is rather disappointing though.  He was a reminder that despite this journey and conflict being pivotal for Middle Earth, it was small.  The grand battles, the clash of great powers, they are a shadow of not only of once was, but are a shadow compared to what currently is.  There are forces out there that are greater than The Dark Lord.  That even the conflict that removed the ring from his hand was small.  That the power that is being fought over is small enough that beings out there would misplace it, because it matters so little to them.

"Okay, I'm gonna attempt to defend the extended editions to you, even though I can acknowledge that they make the trilogy MAD BLOATED. But the thing that makes me go back to the extended editions over and over despite the insane time commitment is CHARACTER. These movies are huge in scale, with massive casts, and the theatrical releases do the best they can to give us the most important beats, but there is so much wonderful character development in the extended scenes. 
Legolas and Gimli's killing competitions that drive their developing bond, pretty much everyone from Rohan got little to know introduction outside of the extended scenes. I didn't even realize that Eowyn and Eomer were brother and sister when I first watched the movies, because their familial bond is so cut out in the theatrical cut. (Eomer also just sort of gets cut out as a character entirely, aside from the one scene of him growling at Grima unless you are really looking for him). 

And while the reminder of Frodo's mithrill might have killed some of the tension of the troll scene, it still adds something in that it establishes the cultural importance of the mithrill, a ""kingly gift"" worth more than the shire and Frodo is shocked to think that he is wearing something so valuable.

Fellowship arguably has the least of these character developing extended scenes, but I would never give up the extended scenes in two towers or return of the king for anything. 

SARUMAN'S DEATH SCENE!! The injustice of that amazing scene being cut is still a bloody tragedy, it wrapped up an important villain arc and offered redemption to a minor villain in the same breath. 

Gimli and Legolas getting drunk together! Still one of my favourite scenes in the trilogy! And that's just the stuff I know was cut out off the top of my head, there was so much more.",0,0,2018-10-02T12:38:22.000Z,LexofGotham,UCVCTqZgpNJf0dzqe3rIQ97g,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,Ugz2U7X3yDIHcCBWRaZ4AaABAg

"I wanted to add something you might find as an interesting connection. Throughout the film Riley is experiencing a breakdown of sorts, as we know, but I noticed how the outside person of Riley (meaning not her individual emotions) was shown (like in the classroom on her first day) in farther back perspective. In other words, what a viewer sees is no where near what is felt on the inside. When Riley was called to introduce herself a major emotional backfire took place and all the classmates saw were a few tears. The rest of the movie continues building on this until Riley takes the bus out of town, but each time what we see emulated within her mind is no where near translated on the outside of her person to other people.

"15:20  Heh.  I know that well (or perhaps just one that looks like it)  all too well.

"I thank God every day that these films were made when they were, and not now. They came in JUST under the wire and are better movies because of it.

What I mean by that is that there is a very clear trend of action adventure movies these days following the Marvel formula. Big CGI sequences, lots of quippy dialogue, etc. And while that works extremely well for Marvel because of the source material and some very talented actors and directors involved, I don't think that kind of filmmaking would have worked for LotR. Just look at how the Hobbit films turned out: One short story stretched artificially into three bloated films that relied too heavily on CGI and dialogue riddled with dumb jokes and terrible writing. The only part of the Hobbit trilogy with any soul is the first 30 minutes or so of An Unexpected Journey, from the backstory of the Dwarves of Erebor, to the dinner scenes in Bag End with all the dwarves. Those parts were fun, reminded me a lot of the original trilogy, and had a lot of soul. I barely even remember the details of what happens in the rest of the films, for how un-interesting they were. Everything about those movies felt like it was checking off boxes on a big summer blockbuster checklist. It was more concerned with spectacle than with being a compelling story. Like I said, the absolute best parts of the film were Bilbo being Bilbo.

The Lord of the Rings trilogy was made with an absurd level of attention to detail and a clear investment of interest by the cast and crew. And I think the interpretations and changes from the books to the screen worked very well. I mean, the actors of the Fellowship got tattoos to commemorate the experience, for goodness' sake. These were decade-defining movies, and deserve every single award and accolade they received. 

Can you imagine the Lord of the Rings being made today? I feel like it would have been destroyed by political correctness (even though nothing is INcorrect about the films as they are, I'm sure there would have been some PC changes to the Fellowship to make it more inclusive and less of a white male dudefest) and plagued by quippy Marvel dialogue and soulless CGI.",2,1,2018-10-02T08:59:37.000Z,aboxofbeans,UCxcIgP0Wa9GRl4JSuPro8Ig,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgwR-cYhQrDBXCyymVB4AaABAg

"10:40 is one of my favorite scenes on rewatch.  The movies turned Aragorn into an initially reluctant heir to Gondor's throne, and some people dislike that choice, but this scene makes it beautiful.

Here is Boromir, unnerved by Lothlorien, a proud son of Gondor (which needs no king), aching to restore the city to its former glory, desperate to avert its impending doom. Here is Aragorn, elf-friend, heir to a city he hardly remembers by virtue of a lineage he considers weakness, on a quest whose importance reckons above all the lives in Gondor. The differences run deep.

But Aragorn sees Boromir’s pain and lends a comforting ear. And Boromir bares his soul, his fear and pride and love for his homeland, to the man who would replace him. Then, impossibly, Boromir goes further. Despite everything, he invites Aragorn into his soul, to share his dream.

Aragorn cannot answer him. If that dream ever stirred in his own breast, it was matched by dread of men’s dreams - the passions that kept the Ring from being unmade as it should have been, thousands of years ago. Isildur’s Bane.

Yet…this is what Aragorn needs to become. The duty Boromir embraces is his duty. The city Boromir loves so well is his city. Boromir is begging him to care, because Aragorn is what Boromir can no longer be. Aragorn can muster only silence filled with shame. For once, though, it is not Man’s weakness but Man’s nobility that shames him.

Later, Aragorn will kneel over a dying man pierced by many arrows, choking on blood and despair. And Aragorn will answer. “I will not let the white city fall, nor our people fail.” He will kiss Boromir’s brow, and close his sightless eyes, and go on to become the king Boromir wanted him to be. The foundation for all of that was laid here, on a tree-root in Lorien, when Boromir called Aragorn home with the clear ringing of silver trumpets.",1,0,2018-10-02T08:47:00.000Z,MathMage,UC3cHBZZaaJk5Ia0PRFk9eSQ,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgxXgDJf3aspEO-RfWB4AaABAg
"Is this a great movie?
Certainly Not.
it was too long, very dark and violent.
Much of the story didnt make sense.
Not a Superman or Batman movie, really.

There are a few reasons to watch this:
1. Batman and Superman's confrontations
the scenes arent long, but theyre pretty cool!
The main battle ( the whole ""Martha"" thing is ridiculous)
While brief, is cool to watch
Batman and Superman together onscreen!

2. Batman saves Clark's mom
This scene is just Incredible!

3.Wonder Woman
Gal Godot...Wow!
Her character is badass!

4. Seeing Wonder Woman, Batman And Superman fight the Doomsday monster!

Jesse Eisenberg was obviously miscast as Lex Luthor
and we did not need much of a convoluted story that goes Nowhere!
What exactly does Luthor have against Batman...or Superman??
Why is Lois involved in all of this? She does Nothing to help the plot or film!
Wonder Woman is cool But What is her motivation for even Being in Gotham??

How was Luthor Even able to override the Kryptonian memory banks to gain access into the chamber?

"Random childhood story:
I managed to get a ticket to a Weta Digital presentation through school, possibly before any of the LOTR films were released. Peter Jackson must have been there, and Andy Serkis possibly as well.
I didn't really realise exactly what it was all about at the time, but they showed the dragon fireworks scene, and man was that awesome! I think they might have done some stuff about motion capture as well. I think I was about 10, so I don't remember a lot.
One of the things that makes watching the films weird is how familiar a lot of the scenery is. I grew up in Twizel, where I could literally see Mount Cook from the school (on a good day), so the pointy snow capped peaks of the Southern Alps and the dry grassy plains next to the mountains are a familiar sight.

It's unique and you don't hear music like it again in the films.

Like he's not trying to find the chamber of secrets or being called the Heir of Slytherin and he isn't under the pressure of being a  Triwizard champion either.

The movie was already 4 hours anyway.  5 or 10 more minutes doesn't hurt at that point!

I still remember talking to my high school friends after seeing the third film in theaters.  I told them, without hesitation or reservation, that the LotR trilogy would end up one day being recognized as the ""movies of our time"" and they laughed at me.  I like to think that among earnest cinephiles, that prediction has become truth.",0,0,2018-10-02T04:36:24.000Z,Samuel Robinson,UC2V1D4-wdw0KrQE2D5NuJnQ,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgxKHUDXNJhERrSjcVt4AaABAg

"Also: A note on accents. I believe Eggsy's accent is the natural way most people speak, but it does vary depending on location. English accents are highly variable, a Liverpool accent is not the same as an Essex accent. (The Essex accent was what I used to have but it's mellowed to more general British Australian.)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyyT2jmVPAk 
A good illustration. Not sure how good she is but you get the idea.

The boys Eggsy is interacting with at the beginning are speaking posh because they went to high class schools. Eggsy refuses to lose his more typically 'lower class' accent because his roots are important to him. Classism is alive and well in England, which is what much of Arthur's issue is about. Harry teaches Eggsy that you can be refined and a gentleman without being a snob, without forgetting your roots. So Eggsy in the second film still has the accent and is still ready to roll with the punches, he doesn't look down on anyone. It's actually similar to My Fair Lady but with the twist that his accent doesn't make him less respectable. 

Those boys wouldn't necessarily speak that way naturally, they were taught to. Even I can imitate the accent a little despite it being years since I lived in England. You lean into your pronunciation, speak very carefully with a little bit of a roll.

Lite known fact. Will smith yelling about ‘And what the hell is that smell!?’ was not scripted. The filming location has a pretty bad odor that if I recall is from dead animals (brine shrimp or some such) in the dirt. Walking and especially dragging the chute behind him was surely stirring up a lot of the stench during a hot day.

"I thought Justice League was okay (5/10) it wasn't really bad or really good, it's just a movie. I really didn't like Steppenwolf he was just a generic one dimensional villain, also wasn't a fan of the Attack of the Clones style visuals in the battles, for as large of a budget as it had, I just had higher expectations. Also a lot of The Flashs jokes felt kind of forced to me, a perfect example is the whole brunch thing getting used so many times, the first time wasn't really funny at all, and then they kept bringing it up, and it just annoyed the hell out of me (not as infuriating as Avengers 2 with the language 'joke' though,  that was extremely overused, I have zero good things to say about that movie can't stand it), also felt like the majority of dialogue was exposition, and little of actual interactions. Also while sometimes it's annoying how OP Superman is, that's kind of the draw to these characters, every DC Character is almost like a God each one more OP than the last, sure somethings like him lifting that building at the end is just completely ridiculous, it's also in a weird way part of the fun.

And prior to pitching it to new line and UA, none of the studios peter Jackson tried to work with wanted to make three separate movies. Legend has it that he had started out with three scripts, but as he became more disheartened with each failed pitch, boiled it down to two, and then one. When he went in to sell it to new line, the execs were already expecting him to pitch three scripts, and almost immediately asked where the other two were.

"While I appreciate the theatrical edition, the extended one is the only one I think about when remembering these movies. I've seen the extended way too many times to count and the theatrical just a few times. I think cutting things back was fine for theaters. You have to consider run time there. But what makes these movies all the more special is how perfect the extended editions are. Not just some extra cut material stuffed into a side part of the DVD/Blu Ray, but actually brought into a complete film.

With things like the mithril, who knows. You can say the scene before might have lessened the impact of Frodo getting stabbed later, but you already know he has it when you are watching the extended because you saw the theatrical first. You know Frodo is the main character here. He's not going to die early in the first of three movies. If you can suspend your disbelief and be worried about him with the theatrical version, you can forget about a scene several minutes earlier mentioning the mithril.",0,0,2018-10-01T22:53:53.000Z,FlareKnight,UCHQGaQKuB9R80uB_xbOMi3w,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgyhaQ7u0wej8V9R7cB4AaABAg

"I think you missed a win with the camerawork for Boromir's rage. The shots where he's wildin' out are zoomed out and we see his whole body, he's yelling and screaming and being physically terrifying, especially because we see all of him and what he could probably do to a little hobbit if he got his hands on him but when he falls it zooms in. He's no longer big and menacing, we get very much the same perspective we do for any other character, especially the hobbits, his face and we see the fear and regret overcome him. We see with him the mistake he's made and his absolute dread at what he's done. I know perspective changes with cameras are a pretty common way to indicate, well, perspective changes but I always loved this one because its so masterfully done. Sean Bean's acting is perfect, he goes from a man in a wild rage trying to protect what he loves to realizing what he's done to his friend and companion, how he's maybe doomed the quest and the same fear that motivated him to pursue the ring now motivates him to regret his actions. The camera only makes it all better for the reasons I mentioned. I know if you gave wins to every amazing work of cinematography in these films you'd basically just have to play the whole movie for us but I thought I would call out one of my favorite scenes and examples of how a camera can change our view of a character in an instant.",0,0,2018-10-01T22:34:35.000Z,Robert Bratley,UC6OtF_13_RAbEGmDqW-RfDA,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgxS3lGZ21H5yFYJBzV4AaABAg

What I think might happen is that, to resurrect the half of the universe who got snapped, there has to be a sacrifice, which Cap will step up to do immediately. The universe gets unsnapped, Cap dissolves after saying some parting words to everyone else, including making amends with Stark, then is trapped in the soul stone, where he finds one other person... Peggy. Cap gets to be with Peggy, everyone else lives. Tony will be so traumatized by what his failure caused, and will give up being Iron Man, paving the way for new heroes, and will go off with Pepper, Banner and Romanoff will run away to the middle of nowhere, where Banner nor Hulk could harm anyone, Spidey will be scarred by his death, but will dedicate himself further into helping others.

"In one of your videos, you explain a win with detailing how this channel is about appreciating the great things that actors, directors, location scouts, composers, props departments and so on, do. ""But not the studios, never the studios.""
Well, The Lord of the Rings actually needs your first Studio Win. 
Peter Jackson's first deal was with Miramax, and the idea was two movies, with major changes from the book. When Miramax was told how much the movies would cost, they said no, and suggested a single film of the whole trilogy. Jackson declined, and went around looking for a new studio for his, Fran's and Philippa's project. When meeting New Line Cinema, and pitching two movies, they were asked why they were making two films, when the original story is a trilogy. Naturally, this was an economical choice for the studio - cashing in on three movies instead of two - but without the studio, we'd have two films which deviated a LOT from the background material, instead of the THREE, VERY truthful ones we got. 
So, Studio Win.",0,0,2018-10-01T21:48:31.000Z,Petronella Wessman,UCNRpCJpvTNgTgCqKuT67mzA,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgwXFHISTW0Y9lDUZ-54AaABAg

"The Balrog.

I grew up in the dawn of CGI. I was in high school when T2 came out. Jurassic Park was the last movie my mom went to in a theater* - to see it in all its 70mm glory on the biggest screen in the state. (The building has since, strangely, turned in to a church.) I was awed by the power of CGI.  But in those, I was awed by ""the power of CGI.""

Even Star Wars Episode I's CGI was, mostly ""impressive CGI.""

The Balrog was the first CGI movie I saw the CGI and *DIDN'T* think ""wow, what amazing CGI."" It was full, jaw-dropping ""HOLY F---ING S--T!"" The _character_ came through perfectly. The combination of, yes, impressive CGI - so impressive that the fact it was CGI didn't even cross my mind, and the absolutely perfect ""vocals"" for it. The Balrog was and is the best visualized fantasy/sci-fi villain ever.

*Edit: Re-reading that, it sounds like more than it means. My mom is alive and well. She just doesn't (and never did) like going to theaters. Jurassic Park was a rare exception.

"It's your channel, and you are totally justified in using theatrical over extended solely on the basis you want to.
That said I can think of five extended scenes which added to the story for me personally:
1. The extended introduction to Eomer and the Rohirrim in the Two Towers. Drawn out a bit longer all the new characters weren't quite so much and their relationship to each other felt better explained.
2. Faramir's flashback to the taking of Osgiliath, which really demonstrates his relationships with Boromir and Denethor powerfully.
3. This one is the biggie. The interrogation and death of Saruman. Sir Christopher Lee was disappointed that it was cut, and if that isn't even addressed...
4. The confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch-King. So badass.
5. The Mouth of Sauron. So creepy. While admittedly he loses some of his effect onscreen, since the audience knows Frodo is alive, his presence nonetheless drives our other heroes into the most shattered mindset before the final battle.

So yeah.

"Aragorn and Theoden are both some of the best castings I've ever seen. I'm torn on Frodo. I grew up with the movies, watched them over and over. Elijah Wood is Frodo. Then around a year and a half ago, at age 24, I read the books. Then I reread the books. Then I listened to the Audiobooks, 3 times. I'm already in the middle of Two Towers, for the third time this year.

After falling head over heels in love with the book, I can't help but see some missing potential in the movies. Which is absurd, because PJ actually made The Lord of the Rings. No director has actually made Dune, or A Song of Ice and Fire. PJ somehow managed to capture the fantasy epic. Fantasy is defined by the fact it doesn't exist, but he _made_ it exist. 

Anyway, the missing potential I spoke of has nothing to do with Tom Bombadil, or Celeborn, or even Fatty Bolger. It has to do with Frodo's age. Every Hobbit is the proper age, except Frodo. Frodo is 50, he's older and a true adult. Pippen, Merry, and even Sam, are youngsters who look up to Mr. Frodo. I won't elaborate on the thematic potential of that age change, but just imagine.

"The prequels, which were released two decades after the original movies, in NO WAY prove that Lucas had it all planned from the start. Creating a beginning based on the middle and end doesn't prove that the beginning was always there. There is no logic in that at all!
I very much believe that George Lucas did NOT have everything planned while making ""A New Hope,"" or even the rest of the original trilogy. First of all, George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" was not the ""Episode IV"" we now know. His original draft of the movie was heavily criticized by his friends, including Steven Spielberg, and only came to be ""A New Hope"" through Lucas's then-wife who severely edited the film. Combine that with the fact that there were multiple drafts for each of the later movies, including totally different plot points for ""Empire Strikes Back,"" and the fact that some of the most praised scenes from the later movies weren't directed by George Lucas, and you've got yourself a severely damaged point of view.
My take on the Sith names, which I see echoed throughout the comments on this video, is that they were taken from the English words ""invader"" and ""insidious."" I've always seen ""Darth"" as a combination of ""dark"" and ""death."" They're supposed to be the most evil beings in the entire galaxy, so Lucas gave them the most evil names his non-creative self could come up with.
Also, how could anyone really praise George Lucas for his creative genius if they simply analyzed the plan to hide Luke and Leia... not that Anakin would have known their names (unless he found people who knew them and used the Force to delve into their minds), but they kept the names that Padmé gave to the babies. Luke even kept his real last name, shared by Anakin. Luke was taken to his evil father's home world to live with his actual aunt and uncle whom his evil father had met in person, to be guarded over by his evil father's former mentor (who also kept his real last name). Great hiding spot. And Leia may have been better hidden, but Anakin KNEW Senator Organa. Vader should be able to recognize R2D2 and C3PO, both of whom stayed with Organa, and later with Leia. And then Leia followed in her adopted father's political footsteps, keeping herself in the public. Those are not genius plans, those are terrible, terrible plans. Someone as smart as Yoda would never have actually approved of that as an effective means of keeping the children hidden. But ""A New Hope"" already existed, so he couldn't change the story, he just had to find a reason for the story.
George Lucas is not a good story teller.",0,0,2018-10-01T18:50:59.000Z,R Nickerson,UCwXmSLH7-BggtKBzKFAVY2A,pTAMYW31l74,True,UgwXEGF-YBVqYNAqNAp4AaABAg

"I’ve actually never seen the theatrical version. I was raised on LoTR (books and movies) and solely on th extended edition, so that’s what I always go to. It’s interesting to hea about the differences. II have similar experiences with seeing the first Hobbit in theatres. It was the most magical movie-going experience I’ve ever had and I get nostalgic just thinking about it (that first Hobbit movie was a gem). It is a bucket list dream of mine to see LoTR in theatres, especially since it’ll be my first time seeing the theatrical version so it’d be a “first” for me. Movie recommendations... 1) Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013). It is a special, magical, beautiful movie that I think you will very much enjoy. 2) Song of the Sea. A magical traditional animation movie made by the Irish studio Cartoon Saloon. It’s like the Irish Studio Ghibli and there’s so much extra effort and attention to detail, from location to continuity to attentiveness to the legends it is based on and adapts. Similarly, Secret of Kells, but it’s a little darker and I enjoy it a little less than SotS. 3) How To Train Your Dragon 2, better than the original in every way and just a great movie.

"Aye... As you stated above, I too gravitate more towards the theatrical versions of these movies. I dearly love the extended editions since they delved deeper into the material I originally read back in 1976 as a school boy... In 2001, we'd all experienced, so much turmoil in our daily lives. I was married with four Son's, and with a local economy tanking as big tobacco died, which was what our entire community was based upon, I had employed my childhood best friend. I was self-employed and even with a family of six to support, I could not watch him and his go under without doing everything I possibly could. In that climate we were struggling. Struggling in every aspect of our existence, and then the trailer came out for this movie...

My childhood friend had read the books with me back in 1976, and he was always more involved with book series than I ever was, so he was literally dying to see ""Fellowship of the Ring"". But, I also wanted to see it almost as much. What surprised me at the time was just how much the trailer resonated with my four boys. Although they had never read the books, they all would run through our single wide trailer whenever they would hear the trailers music come on the TV. My youngest was 11, then there were the twins, both 14 and my oldest was 17. So, my wife would look up at me knowing we were barely keeping our heads above water paying bills and getting groceries, yet even she wanted to watch this movie...

A week before The Fellowship of the Ring came out, my best friend and I went out and did two weeks worth of work in one. It nearly killed us physically and mentally, but we made just enough extra money to be able to take the families to see the movie. My Father. A brutally practical man that grew up during WW2 even dropped by our trailer and added that he would like to go with us as well. This was a man that had watched just two movies in theaters during his entire life. Unknown to me was the fact that he had read the books back in the late 60's, and even as an uneducated rural farmer, he desperately wanted to see this movie which surprised to my core. I would have never guessed the man that raised me would have ever read a fantasy book...

So, the day the movie came out my friend and his family drove to my trailer and my dad showed up minutes later. At the time we had one of those Chevy vans that had three rows of bench seats bolted in them. My wife counted out just enough money for our six tickets and the gas to drive 50 miles to the nearest movie theater. We loaded all nine people into the van, pulled out of our gravel driveway and off we went to see ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" on December 19th, 2001...

It was my wife's idea to let the boys stay home from school since if we had waited until after school, we would have never made the drive in time, so they owed their mother on that one. My dad told his usual stories to the kids and my friend and I wondered if this movie would be better than the animated version we'd watched back in the 70's... We arrived, got our tickets, filled up one entire row of seats in the theater and my wife patted my arm as the movie screen flickered to life...

About three hours later we all stumbled out of the theater and back into the sunshine outside. I was in my late 30's at the time, with a family of six, but suddenly felt like a child all over again that day. I had a smile on my face that simply refused to fade, but the truly strange thing was that my eleven year old and my sixty year old dad wore the same foolish grin as I did. As we walked back to our beat-up old Chevy van, I noticed every single one of us were smiling and talking about the various scenes we'd just watched together. My wife is certainly not a big fantasy fan, yet she loved the movie and even promised our boys that when the next books movie came out, we'd see it as well. On the long drive home my friend, dad, wife and kids all reviewed our favorite parts of The Fellowship of the Ring. My wife and Son's all begged to know what was going to happen in the next movie, but my dad immediately spoke up saying that if they wanted to know then they could all read the books, which he apparently had and was willing to lend out. Over the next six months those aged copies of the Lord of the Rings were passed back and forth between my wife and kids. It was one of the only times that I remember where my wife and boys bonded over reading a fantasy book series. She made five different colored book markers and I swear none of those three books ever sit in one spot for longer than a few moments before it would be grabbed up and whisked off to be read as fast as humanly possible before someone else would yell out to know where it had disappeared off too. By the time they had been thoroughly read by my wife and four boys I worried about their structural integrity. They were old paperbacks from the 60's and cheaply printed to boot. I offered to buy my dad a new set since they were more than well wore by the time I could return them, but the hardest, most spartan man I knew as my father gave me a lopsided grin and told me they were just fine the way they were...

The three years that these movies came out were a surprising and almost magical time in my life. It sounds so foolish to say such a thing, but for my family it was. We were experiencing a brutal time in our life financially and socially. Holidays were almost depressing because we had so little to give our boys and each other, but during those three years my wife kept her promise. She would somehow squirrel away just enough cash for us to fill up the old van and load everyone into it to go see the next Lord of the Rings movie. For those three years, seeing those movies in December all together replaced our Christmas gift giving. And, in all honesty, I enjoyed those three Decembers better than almost any of the rest. The Lord of the Rings trilogy is an epic and finely crafted series of movies, but to my family they're even more. Whenever I happen across one of them now-a-days fond memories bubble up in my mind and for the time they're on the nostalgia is over powering for me. Two years ago my wife and I lost one of our twins in the Army. He was injured overseas and sent home where we lived with him in the local VA hospital for several years until he passed a couple years ago. Whenever he was in so much pain his pain medicine stopped working he would ask me to put in one of the Lord of the Rings movies and we'd all gather around his bed to watch it with him...

It's strange when something like a movie trilogy takes on a meaning much more than it was originally intended, but for my family those films will always hold a truly special place in our hearts. Every emotion humans are capable of are tied up in those movies for us and I suspect they always will. My youngest son had our first grandchild five years ago, and this year he wants to know if we will all get together at Christmas and watch The Fellowship of the Ring with her. So, it looks like another generation of ours will be watching these movies as well. This has been a long post I know, but I've been a subscriber of yours for a long time and I sincerely love your channel and it's upbeat view of the movies I love. In today's world that's something that really needs to be stated sadly. Too many younger people tend to lean towards the negative simply because it's the ""in"" thing to do. Without going on an entirely separate rant I'll leave it at that. What you do. Trying to see the positive side of things appeals to me personally, and when I saw the title of this weeks movie I had to try and explain just how much this particular video means to me and thank you for finally doing this trilogy...

The one thing I would ask is for you might be willing to talk about the extra characterization that boromir gets? (and by extension faramir) because that’s honestly my main love for the extended versions. It’s shows how wonderful boromir actually was and how starkly the ring corrupts.

"I do have to say I prefer the extended version of Fellowship myself, and that's mainly for all the character exploration we get that's not in the Theatrical, especially some extra with Boromir. I'm still glad Jackson managed to make him feel like a flawed but still heroic character you really feel compassion for, though, as I never felt like the books accomplished that as much. You can see how desperate he is to save Gondor, and that being his reason for wanting the ring at first, and the ring exploiting that out of him You can just see how pained he is knowing that many of the people of his kingdom die trying to keep Mordor at bay. It's a really powerful point for his character.

That being said, both cuts have advantages and disadvantages, but when it comes to Return, I personally believe Extended is a must. I'm glad you've started talking about these movies and how impressive they are, not just on a grand scale but in attention to detail and all the brilliant little things and technical tricks that went into them ^^",0,0,2018-10-01T16:52:08.000Z,Cool70sfreak,UCtmE2n121Sr2BIWaV-FIyzQ,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,Ugyq-xdE6hZt7BNB7pJ4AaABAg

In all honesty I will always start to tear up a bit during Boromir's redemption. All of the emotion brought into Boromir's final fight by the music and the echo of Boromir getting hit by each arrow. He is truly redeeming himself by standing up for Merry and Pippin and even after he gets shot(knowing he is going to die) he continues to fight attempting to at least stall until help arrives.

I am sadly one of the ones they missed out on the Theatrical releases. I didn’t see these movies until the Platinum Extended Edition was out in ‘04 (I think it’s ‘04), and it’s 2-disc Extended edition, which I now have the Blu-Ray version. I can’t watch the Theatrical because I grew up on ONLY the Extended Edition, and maybe I am an exception or not as observant back then (it WAS 14 years ago and I’ve had training in Observance since then), but even with the extra explanations I really did feel the same way as without them because it was that awesome.
Also, confession: I didn’t get into these movies until a friend of mine brought the Two Towers to Spanish class and we watched it over the course of a week with Spanish Subtitles with the Teacher’s permission. Even then I was half-asleep when watching it and I STILL was interested enough to get the aforementioned Platinum edition, and I was hooked. I’m okay that you kept it to the Theatrical version, so I’m not gonna be one of the complainers, but forgive me for not being able to enjoy the Theatrical version like you did, since I never noticed the opportunity at the time and you did.
Great job with this movie, and I’ll look forward to Two Towers and Return of the King!!",0,0,2018-10-01T16:09:53.000Z,RedDragonForce2,UCdWQxq9HjHaCnJl4ftktm4w,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgwokCrq45-aN5xaVkl4AaABAg

"Your preference of the theatrical edit is completely valid and I absolutely see your reasoning. I just see the extended editions as better in my opinion solely because the way I enjoy storytelling. I LOVE going out of my way to discuss the tiny details of the world and characters of my favorite shows, and the fact that Tolkien’s books are the epitome of world-building to the extreme makes the movie adaptations one of the best examples in recent history to be able to do that. The only real way we can even touch that level of world building is either through 5+ sequels or leaving the world of film as a medium to tell stories entirely, since TV and book series have all the time in the world to broaden their horizons. This series took Tolkien’s life work creating Middle Earth and portrayed it as perfectly for the medium of film as potentially possible, and the way people live and die by the extended editions proves that it was done so well that the only way to make it better is to add more to it. And while there are definitely some scenes which could have been worked out a bit better in the extended cut, I think it adds to the life of the story in incredible ways.",0,0,2018-10-01T16:05:06.000Z,MostLikelyMortal,UCmqVOsiBfbttokon7OiXckg,tK4-NV1kYQU,True,UgwmwtDJwFDJAiwiOk54AaABAg

Or when Lurtz throws a dagger at him and he deflects it because Lawrence Makoare - Lurtz's actor - couldn't see where he was throwing and actually lobbed a sharp knife at Viggo, who made a split-second reaction and deflected it with his sword. Or how Viggo was so in the moment and so miffed about the knife thing that he actually decapitated Lawrence at the end of the scene. Or that he actually married Liv Taylor for their Aragorn/Arwen relationship.

And doesn’t Galadriel sound surprised when mentioning Hobbits, as if she never expected it. And since this is before the extended Hobbit Movie including Silmarillion, it’s like even with her foresight, she couldn’t believe someone so small and humble would have any effect on the war. And it’s a pleasantly surprised tone because she realizes that neither seeking nor wanting power, they aren’t corrupted by it, even though she, the “fairest”, actually was tempted all too quickly.

"That moment at the 3:00 mark when Frodo turns and looks back at his friends.

You have just been on this journey and you have just lost the one member of the Fellowship who has been there to guide you from the beginning. Of course you are going to be completely shattered. Show that on your face"" As for the comment at 4:05....apparently, at least for some of the scenes, the real actors (at least the ones who were not Hobbits) WERE in the boats. In an interview, Viggo Mortensen who played Aragorn said that he had the scale doubles for Frodo and Sam in his boat and the one who played Frodo said ""Viggo...don't worry about me.

"I think it was the summer of '94 when they'd started advertising the original trilogy was coming out for sale, with the statement ""...one. Last. Time."" I felt panicked, thinking OMG I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO SEE THEM AGAIN IF I DON'T SNAG THAT SHIZNIT... so with my first check from my summer job, I red-shifted to the newly-opened Wal-Mart and got me my set ($30 at the time, if I remember right). As it turned out, 'original' meant 'before the new edits replace it', so I felt a bit more at ease... plus excited over the re-releases to follow. I was excited over the news that cut scenes would get added back in, because I KNOW they'd been in the theater releases I'd gone to, plus my storybooks have almost all of them included. Mainly the scenes with Luke and Biggs on Tatooine, and Luke's catching the battle with Leia's ship in the sky with binocs. 

So I think a good part of my disappointment when we went to the re-release was that stuff NOT being in it... more than (yet not enough to exclude) the additions, which weren't my cuppa. But I feel the sting a little less, due to my panic attacking letting me have the original versions. And we still have a functional VCR.

This movie did spark a sort of emotional renaissance in me when i saw it the first time. Before then i had never truly cried in my adult life. It was hard to understand other peoples emotions and deal with them appropriately. This movie gave me a way to relate to these feelings by imagining them as an action in the brain. Since then i have always told people to watch it and  learn from it. Especially now that i know i'm on the spectrum, i will show this movie to others as a way of telling them how i work and see these feelings.

I saw it with a friend, and when it was over, I remember going to his house, and trying to explain this movie to his brother.  It was impossible to convey to him what we had just experienced.  

When the Avengers was released, I was 47.  Within minutes of the movie's start, I was that 11 year old kid again.  Iron Man, Thor and Captain America were all great movies that I really enjoyed, but this one took things to a new level. I used to say that no one could understand being a kid in 1977, and the excitement of Star Wars, seeing it as it first came out.  The game changing aspect of it was something that kids from later generations just wouldn't be able to understand.

"I don't want to say I consider Dark Knight to be over-rated.  I think it was a great movie, and Heath Ledger's performance was awesome.

Having said that, I think the ending was weak, and the way they spun rises off of it was horrible.

You see, they have this thing called forensics.  For the ending of this movie to lead into the beginning of Rises, the police would have had to fudge the details of every one of Dent's murders.  After all, while they were taking place, Batman was fighting the Joker in view of most of the Gotham PD.  I can believe that Gordon browbeat his son into not revealing that his hero had saved him, but would basically all the pathologists and witness refuse to come forward here?

Of course, Nolan always portrayed Batman as someone who reacted.  He was never really ahead of the curve.  He was never a detective.  I can believe him thinking this would work.  I can even believe  Gordon went along with it in the heat of the moment.  I just can't believe that they never dealt with that issue in the time between.",0,0,2018-09-30T20:57:51.000Z,Jack Wells,UChrxGMz1p-4yGA0IrDVPyHw,EwANrUwJ9-Y,True,Ugwm3l9DW_3nfQ3C3_F4AaABAg

"It always bugged me that Aragon was able to ward off the 5 Ringwraiths on top of Weathertop, but then the Witch-King totally humiliates Gandalf during the battle for Minas Tirith.  However, I just recently watched the Fellowship again, and come to the conclusion that the Nazgul's power is tried to Sauron's strength and power. During the Fellowship, Sauron is weak in comparison to the other movies, so it would make sense that the Nazgul are also weaker as well. This realization doesn't discredit Aragon's courage and ability to fight. He still took on five undead Ringwraiths.",1,1,2018-09-30T20:20:53.000Z,Skyler Brandt,UC6SCni8xXE47Cl2RXT6_nNQ,b7evmxZyz_M,True,UgzxNkUl587tV4_UC5l4AaABAg
"1:06 yes yes she is in reality the reason mankind accepted the rings so willingly is because it would exstend their life while improving their other abilites….. and the elves neglected to tell mankind that these rings were created with the aid of Suaron.
2:07 also helps that basicly Saurons defenses had already been weakened by Gilgalad and his father. but yeah honestly Suaron has reason to be overconfident he new that no one would be able to throw the ring into the fire.... and he was right. but he didn't count on someone pushing or said person dancing his way off into the fire.
4:00 that's because this was reference in the Lord of the rings as it was a sequel to the hobbit. but yes peter Jackson wanted to do the hobbit movies too.
5:46 they put a magnet under the floor to make sure the weight of it would be understood
6:00 I know I thought that was a fantastic too
6:34 also the only member of the white council who new about the one ring and that information was Saruman and he intended to take the ring for himself if he got the chance.... and in all honesty he was strong enough that he could have won if he got ahold of it, which in of itself is terrifying 
8:25 funny but the leaf is literally just Tabaco.
12:50 honestly got really said when I read the books and found out hteir was this badass elf we never got to see.
13:06 Elrond did that in the books but the river is a bit of a misrepresentation since they waited until they wer halfway accrossed and wouldn't have time to get back, basicly the river was HUGE but the shot still did it justice.

"As a little 'experiment' I chose to watch the Cinema Sins and this Cinema Wins video on Ragnarok back to back. First thing I noticed is that even Cinema Sins had to redact a sin for Korg, which shows his comedy is so good it passes even the coldest of judgements. The second I noticed was the difference in lengths. Then that Cinema Sins videos in general were seemingly shorter. I was wondering why CinemaWins videos were longer, until I got to the end of the video and remembered why. It's because of the general discussion bit you do at the end. CinemaSins doesn't have that. Their sins aren't a comment on the movies quality, they're played literally just for laughs and that's it, that's why there's nothing more to say about it at the end of the video, it just ends after counting the sins. CinemaWins' videos actually contain substance, they have something to say about the movie, something that gives a new found appreciation of it. Most people know already that the 'sins' in CinemaSins are mostly for jokes, and not genuine critisism of the film. But I'm willing to bet a lot of people don't (YouTube audiences is mostly inhabited by young impressionable people after all), and even people who do know not to take it seriously are unconsciously affected by it. The drive to point out all the negatives, to pointlessly nitpick at things that aren't really relevant to the quality of the movie. That's exactly why we're here, with the culture of hating new movies, picking a part every thing that doesn't 'make sense', every 'cliche', and every 'inconsistency' (A lot of them even being wrong or easily disproven as CinemaWins has demonstrated), sometimes even pointing out how movies don't follow real life logic, seriously? When did movies pretend to be real? The whole point of view presented by a show like CInemaSins ignores the fact that movies are ART, they're created to be enjoyed and to convey a message. Now, I'm not saying that CinemaSins is ruining our perception of movies, but it's the popularisation and celebration of his kind of content and 'review' of movies that has put us where we are now (yes, even though they're not meant as reviews, some people still view them as such, taking every sin to heart). There's a reason why when I searched for 'Cinemasins Ragnarok' I saw their videos above this one with many more views. Sure, they have a bigger following, and have had more time to build their following. But negativity sells better than positivity, people flock online to see where a movie failed, not where it succeeded. No one comes online to hear about how great the soundtrack for a new movie was, or how much talent went into the set-piece, the costumes, the CGI. We take it for granted, and don't even consider it. CinemaWins is the first YouTuber I've wanted to see grow much bigger not simply because I find them entertaining and want to see them succeed, but because I think their success could be genuinely good and important for people, for internet culture as a whole. CinemaWins converted me from one of the people who followed along with every 'sin' of new movies, into someone who just wants to enjoy them, and recognise the talent that was put into them. In an era that sees the internet consumed by negativity, CinemaWins and channels like his, are our hope at redemption, our hope at saving ourselves from the 'Age of Outrage' that we find ourselves in. I don't even think I'm exaggerating a bit here, CinemaWins is an incredibly important channel. What he stands for, what he brings to our online community, is important. He's our New Hope, and it's time that we come together to fight the empire that is filling our beloved internet and online culture with hate. Yes, I just seriously made a metaphorical comparison between real life and Star Wars, and I stand by it.

"I think there are three reasons why this movie trilogy was so epic and awesome. 

1) The script stayed extremely close to the books. Yes, they cut out Tom Bombadil and some songs, but those never contributed much to the overall story.
2) The films were simply gourgeous. The CGI and live action sets and backgrounds were SO well done. Some people complained that some scenes are more of a commercial for New Zealand tourism than contributing the to the film, but I disagree.
3) The stars were well cast and played their parts to a tee. Even the supporting actors are memorable in these movies.

The prequels takes place in a time that's the high of the empire and of the Jedi order, to the point that they've become complacent. Isn't it fair to for a moment think that maybe the contrast between the dirty grim look of the original movies, and the clean serene beauty of the prequels, is actually a contrast that makes sense plot-wise? It's two different worlds, one before a great horrible war, and one after.

"I love you cinemawins for finally tackling the LOTR movies! I just wanted to ask one thing, I know you are doing the theatrical release of the movie, and  I love how many times you just increased the win counter from all the greatest scenes, moments, references from the books and. But I would be lying if I didn't say I wish you would've rather have reviewed the LOTR movies from the extended editions. So much more to add the win counter such as, The improved ADR compared to the theatrical version, Bilbo's narration of Hobbits, the Green Dragon Inn with the Hobbits dancing, The Passage of the Elves, The Passage Through the Marshes, Aragon whispering the lament of the Lay of Luthien, The creation of Uruk-Hai and the ""birth"" of Lurtz, which should also add a win as that was the original way Tolkien said that Orcs were created ""Born of slime and mulch"" Talking about the Athealas or Kingsfoil plant that helps in healing, Boromir teaching the Hobbits how to fight then to have them drop him and then drop Aragon who was eating an apple, The frontal view of Moria, The Door of Moria, and All the actors deserve their own win, Okay I can go on and I know there is only so much time, but for this Trilogy I can watch every video you make about it and not for one second be bored. Hell I wouldn't even be mad if you made it into 3 or 4 parts for each movie.

"5:20 A little theory I had seen online, most likely tumblr but i cannot remember:
 so from what we know from Thor Ragnarok, Loki can see people memories and Loki through them, When Odin first picked him up, what if Loki saw memories of thor as a child and of the war with the frost giants. Because he saw these things, the changing of his skin colour and eyes wasnt just a spell that Loki cast but a defence reaction to try and ""blend in"" with the Aesir. A trick which worked so well on himself and burred deep in his subconscious that Loki himself was tricked. It wasn't until he was touched by someone of his own kind that he could see himself as he truly was.",0,0,2018-09-30T14:42:08.000Z,SuperSonicBlur,UCEQQfZK2SI_ZJChDxaOkNrQ,-GN_2JCWml0,True,UgxzrBGixe5YZd1Q1HJ4AaABAg

"Just now getting around to LOTR? lol, jk. But anyway will take the time to add my voice to all those who first saw this movie through the eyes of a child to add that the movie was just as beautiful to my middle aged eyes. :) I will admit when I had first heard about they were going to do a live action of LOTR back in the late 90's I was very skeptical. Like a lot of people I had come across Tolkien's work in high school and ever since I had pretty firm ideas in my head of how things looked, sounded, etc. Then when I heard they were going to use special effects to ""shrink"" actors of typical height I could just imagine the disaster. The complete disappointment that was the Dungeons & Dragons movie was fresh in my mind. So, when that December day came I bought my ticket and sat down hoping to not have to run screaming from the theater. I actually went against my better judgment and bought an incredibly high priced drink and a small bag of popcorn, fought through the previews and finally the lights go out and the New Line Cinema logo comes in, then I hear a voice saying ""The World is changed..."" ..Ok, that is different, hold on, now they are showing the races and the forging of the rings, then Sauron and the united armies of men and elves against him in the elder days. I honestly do not know exactly how I felt during the prologue to be honest I was watching the screen so hard trying to soak everything in. But by the time the camera pans around bag end and you see the tree on the hill overhanging the round door with a sign on the gate and Gandalf steering his cart up to the lane I finally relaxed. And for the next few hours I never moved, I loved everything. I wanted to shout when Aragorn dives into the scene as the Ringwraith stabs Frodo and you see Aragorn from Frodo's point of view wielding a torch in one hand and his sword in the other. I got to see a version of Rivendell that far exceeded anything I had imagined it to be, I almost cried as Gandalf held his staff and says ""Let me risk a little more light"" and Shore's musical score took me into Dwarrowdelf. Then came the flight to the bridge and he shouts ""I am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor! The dark fire will not avail you!"". And by the time Sam wades out into the river to pursue Frodo and then the both of them get their first glimpse of Mordor in the distance and the screen fades I knew that this had been the single greatest experience I had ever had seeing a movie. Like so many I had already lived with the story for years before hand but none of the nitpicking mattered anymore. It didn't matter that Tom Bombadil was not in the movie, it did not matter that Tolkien actually never stated that hobbits had overly large feet. It didn't matter that in the books it was Glorfindel who rides to the rescue at the Ford of Rivendell and not Arwen. None of it mattered. What did matter was that for a few hours at least I was allowed to forget what had happened just a few months prior in September and literally go into my most favorite story ever. And no matter how the later Hobbit trilogy let me down hard, I won't forget the debt we all owe to Peter Jackson and his entire crew for that much at least.",0,0,2018-09-30T12:18:04.000Z,Richard Russom,UC2VAdbvmVfi8FclU2H0sh8A,b7evmxZyz_M,True,UgxPycpffa2Jhrqht9t4AaABAg

"11:35 Fun fact, this was how the 5 o'clock tea tradition began irl. The British Queen of the time was a Portuguese princess who had decided the break between lunch and dinner was too long, so instead of randomly snacking in between meals she started taking a regular break in the afternoon, which included her favorite drink brought from the newly discovered territories to the East, a herb infusion referred to as ""tchá"". The French and British kept the ""t"" in the word, the Portuguese kept the rest ( _chá_ ). The court emulated the Queen's habits and thus the famed afternoon tea tradition began.

Also, even though he grew up a little in A New Hope, he's still just a kid. A kid who's grown up on a dessert planet. Of course he'd underestimate the danger and difficulty of traveling in a snowstorm. He wanted to get back to base as soon as possible, and he probably thought he could make it too.

"You forgot a win for this movie....there are several moments in this movie, particularly with Po and Tigress, but as a whole with Po and his friends where you can clearly see how much stronger the friendship is between them. For example, on the boat when Tigress is asking Po what's going on with him and giving him wisdom and counsel and opening up a bit about her own story....then in the jail when she hugs Po and and tells him to stay with the masters and forbids him from fighting, NOT because she doesn't believe in him, but because she cannot bear to see her friend be killed by Lord Shen and she knows Po is compromised. And then at the end when Po is looking at his friends all fighting beside him and following him....I like how these moments all go very quiet, but you can feel the emotions clearly in each scene and they are powerful. Particularly at the end when they are all in the water....notice, he looks at all his friends, but goes to Tigress first to make sure she's OK. They all went from completely HATING the idea of Po in the first film to now fighting beside him and trusting him unconditionally.

"Pretty solid theory I think Steve will continue being Cap for 1 more movie because I think he could do with a solo send off so there's a Cap 4 that ends with Bucky becoming the new Captain/Nomad or maybe Falcon does. Guardians tend to have a running theme of dealing with loss of loved ones though with James Gunn outta the picture who knows, personally I feel that everyone who died before the snap should stay dead so Asgardians(Loki and Heimdall) and Gamora, so that if Guardians 3 still happens they can be dealing with the grief that even though they stopped Thanos it wasn't enough to bring Gamora back with Nebula definitely being the person who directly kills Thanos by punching him with the Gauntlet.

The defeat of Sauron and Isildur's claiming of the Ring heralded the end of the Second Age.

Also, comment story time, come and take a seat, kiddies.
Two midnite premiers I'll never forget are this and Phantom Menace, and that's 'cuz of my dad. When we went to see Menace, a movie Pops had been waiting to arrive for 16-ish years, I had to sit there and watch him kinda wilt like the Beast's magic rose for 2 hours and it sucked harder than a starving mosquito. BUT, these Lord of the Rings movies get announced, and he'd been a hardcore Tolkien fan since childhood.. admittedly, he was worried going in, but the movie did not let him down an inch. I think the most amazing part was when the Shire's revealed in its verdant, peaceful splendor and I looked to my dad; it's like he was glowing bright and smiling like I'd never seen him do in that hard-boiled life of work he leads.. it was amazing and I can't thank this movie enough for healing him up like that, and now CW's gonna enjoy it with us!

"This is awesome. The fact that you drop in little mentions of some of the changes is actually helping. I, like a lot of other LOTR fans, loved the films and it was more exciting because we knew how unlikely it was that we'd get live-action adaptations of this quality. And we recognized that characters like Bombadil and Ghan-Buri-Ghan appeared in portions that would slow down the pace of a film version, but as time went on we found out that they'd gutted parts of it, not just for flow or time but for no obvious reason. They did the inexplicable... they changed character motivations. I've never understood making huge changes to a story you already thought was good enough to be a movie, though some have come out well. But here they just had a bunch of people suddenly uncertain or actually angry about things they had once accepted or liked.

So yeah, I can forgive some things being omitted but not so much gutting story and character. Just having some of that mentioned has made this easier to watch.",0,0,2018-09-30T07:24:03.000Z,Bee Whistler,UCCfWOz3ytk--OcbjIZNlh_g,b7evmxZyz_M,True,Ugxcgx70FHXWFnzncG14AaABAg

"On Sauron and Isildur: Sauron reaching for Isildur makes a lot more sense if you have some background information about him. Sauron (who was called Mairon originally) was a Maia, and a spirit of fire who was corrupted by Morgoth. Sauron radiated an aura of pure malice, and his body temperature was so hot he could literally roast people to death by touching them, like he did with poor Gil-galad. So it's quite possible that he thought, hey, let's do that to idiot King Isildur, too, and continue to wipe out the line of the leaders of the surviving Faithful of Númenor.
