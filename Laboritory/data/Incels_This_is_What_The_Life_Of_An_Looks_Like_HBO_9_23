"I want to clear something up right now. For all the hate and the mysogynists that are in the world. There are those that feel they have the right to look down onto others. For those that look at others and think it's okay to call people out on things because they see it circulate through media and figure it's okay to target people, are in the wrong. Copy pasta this if you want. The internet will always be a fucked up place. I will always try to break the boundaries in respect to what I believe the matrix is oh to real it would seem. :) I believe calling someone incel is just as bad as calling someone fat or ugly or a loser. When in reality their success with their desired partner may be related to something different than what is in immediate view. 2016-17 surprised me with this new found sense of classifying people. Talking about it like it's an open subject. I know nobody discusses this in person. I've yet to have someone come to my face and insult me in a very long time. Even if they laugh behind my back personally I know they have no balls. Good luck to all. Work on yourselves without worrying about what the internet deems real. They would all try and make you look weak because of these types of views

"The sad thing is, the movement is encouraging this ideology mostly amongst the mentally ill, who find it hard to form relationships. Regardless of attractiveness, social isolation and depression seems to run rampant in their group, which perpetuates the idea of their logic. How can someone see past their warped sense of reality, when the whole workings behind the group is the ""black pill"" philosophy? They truly believe that it's one big conspiracy, and it's fueled by a rejection of ""mental normality"".

It's brainwashing the sick and vulnerable into believing that they have a superior outlook on society.

"Its hard to believe there so many young males who think like this. 
I think its a generation thing. 
They grew up with and behind the computer. 
Our generation was forced to go outside, we were glad when the Nintendo 8 Bit came out, but even then we went outside, do what young boys do at that age, and that (often bad) behaviour was kind of a preparation for things to come. You learned to socialize, to make friends without internet, ur social skills were not an issue because u talked everyday with lots of people, and u knew everyone in ur neighborhood. 

Now ? Kids barely go outside, have no connection on that deeper lvl with eachother, you used to see groupsz of them standing on corners and other places where they meet, etc. 
In Europe in the 80's and 90's you could see kids play soccer everywhere, literaly everywhere. Now u wee occasionaly two kids with a ball. Thats it.

This is why fathers are needed more than ever in western society. Without a strong Male in the house these guys will never know what it takes to be a man and will always be jealous of everyone else. It's not even sex it's that these guys just have built up rage it seems and when they make friends with other mentally ill people they just keep pushing each other more out to sea. Sex is amazing but building strong friendships and pursuing a good life is better.

"incels remind me of ""irony"" Elliot Rodgers was a fairly decent looking young guy, same with this dude. the problem is not them wanting sex and not getting it but instead being radicalised by a dark corner of the internet.

also noteworthy is how incels make plenty of noise about how ""selective"" they are about women.. surely beggars can't be choosers?!

  and yeah it can be difficult talking to women cus many will mention they have a boyfriend as a queue for you to go away.. but if you want sex so bad you have to try and self improve, fill your life with stuff to talk about.. but it is true woman are attracted to money. you can get sex but you'll spend through the nose to get it .. either with hooker or normal means. 

i think the cure for incel is MGTOW honestly the more you ignore women at face value, the less you look at them, the less you think about them and the less you have a burning desire for sex. it will happen, but you have to make it happen, 

and worse case scenario, a couple of bucks spending on backdoor dot com hey presto you're no longer an incel

youll get what you're given even if its a big ol' landwhale to bang, and if any incel refuses then you know they are a poser

Elliot Rogers was just a depressed psychopath, lets stop trying to give it a cute name ""incel""

If you're to be any wise I would say that the issue its with not being able to own your body and channel the anger through meditation and let your body flow your masculinity within itself as its natural healing energy not as your enemy.

Most contemporary women have a lot more self-respect than women in the past, and don't want to associate with people like that. That's what pissing them off and where the seething hatred and the constant bitching about ""modern, western women"" comes from.

"Blame the porn industry and mass media for creating the ""incel movement"". Here's my advice to any incels out there who have a lot of resentment and hatred. 
Step 1 - Lay off these chat sites, stay away from social media such as snapchat and instagram, don't watch porn
Step 2 - Fix your sleep routine. Sleep earlier and wake up earlier. Now, if you can't sleep, refer to step 3 cause it may help
Step 3 - Change your diet; eat clean and healthy, exercise, cut out caffeine.
Step 4 - Meditate!!!! Use self guided hypnosis/meditation videos on YouTube for assistance if you need it. THIS ONE IS REALLY IMPORTANT
Step 4 - Read more books! or work on a new skill! THIS ONE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
Step 5 - Change your wardrobe. If you want to be taken more seriously, you must dress the part. Wear more button downs or plain tees. Don't wear any graphic tees as this will make you look more immature if you don't look the part. 
Step 6 - Start budgeting and saving your money (if you have any) 
Step 7 - Write down your goals and start tackling them!!! 

Bonus step!!!! - Surround yourself with anything and everything positive, whether it be music (this one really helps! Look up positive, motivational and uplifting playlists), friends, mentors etc. THIS ONE IS ALSO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Without a supportive foundation, overcoming your personal struggles is extremely tough. You need someone to kick you in the ass and get you back on track when you're slacking!

Don't make excuses! There are tons of resources that you can utilize. I'm 23 and only starting to take this seriously now! Trust me. My race is identified as the least desirable and most unattractive. I have experience on both sides. You shouldn't shame yourself for being ugly or a virgin. Let me tell you, I lost my virginity at 19 and to tell you the extreme truth, sex is overrated unless it's with someone you love or someone you can be responsible and have fun with. There's nothing really special about it unless it's with someone you love or someone who loves you for being YOU. Women are not to be objectified. Focus on yourself and everything good in life will gravitate towards YOU! Subscribe to my YouTube channel as I'll help all of you guys out of the darkness and into the light.

"its actually NOT therapeutic to constantly surround yourself with negativity, even if its your friends.  its just a proven fact that when you make an effort to think differently, it shapes your brain and your outlook.  which inspires you to take action and manifest your reality.  this is just science.  i used to spend a lot of time online chatting with friends about all of my problems and then i realized that people just didnt want to talk to me about it, not because they didn't care but because it was bringing them down too.  and tahts not to say we shouldnt care but when you're depressed you need to do something about, whether its therapy or some other treatment. isolating yourself is actually self defeating.  take it from someone who'se done it.  i'm starting to get out of the house more now, interact with people and nature and go to events and trying to make new friends and see new perspectives. when you're constantly bathing in only one perspective its going to stunt your brain.",0,0,2018-08-25T19:02:52.000Z

"As I watch this, I am acutely reminded of the incessant whining by Lindy West, Amanda Marcotte, and so many other physically unattractive women who complain how unfair it is that men have an unfavorable opinion about their weight and overall appearance, even though men have the absolute right to reject what they find repulsive in women (just as women do with men they find repulsive).  Yet, they have been given a platform to shame, insult, ridicule, and socially/emotionally coerce men into dating women they do not naturally find attractive.  

It is ironic when men (who are inherently unattractive) are having such a hard time navigating the complex, mind-racking dating world, these women throw it back in their faces and tell them that the onus is on them to change, even though much of what they expect men to change is not pratical nor morally feasible.  But when women are in the same situation as these men, people take sympathy with them and direct blame at men for not forcing themselves to find them attractive.  I do not see anyone shouting down West or Marcotte for displaying some of the same behaviors as these ""incels.""",4,0,2018-08-23T04:22:41.000Z

"Like everything, there's more than one reason. For sure, men have to look their best i.e. get in shape, work hard, be your own man and take control of your life, so being a victim while simultaneously having no agency to better yourself is not good enough.

BUT, don't think for one goddamn second that hypergamy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy) doesn't exist in the west now more than ever likely due to the sheer number of people available, higher economic inequality, the internet, social media, porn, steroids (for gym buffs) etc etc etc. So now we have a society where people's views of who is attractive is warped, and so there is likely to be more and more people (both men and women) who are now deemed less and less attractive. Long story short, incels will likely grow over time (both male and female).

With that being said, females currently are able to demand the sex they want from males (because men supply it more frequently i.e. men chase and women choose), so there's more male supply than female demand meaning offered male sex is deemed as cheaper (i.e. less valuable). Because of hypergamy, more and more men (who offer the sex) can't get ready access as the women who demand the sex only want it from higher quality males (as there is now a ""feast"" situation for women as opposed to ""famine""). Therefore there will likely be more incel men than women.

To incel men, I say this. It's truly terrible what's going out there, but don't let it make you bitter. Women and sex are not the be all and end all of life. Focus on your own interests outside of women. Get in shape to boost your confidence, find something you're passionate about, and gain mastery over it. Forge your own path. Go your own way.

They steep themselves in self hate and a desperate desire to be understood, then act as if no one could ever relate to any of them and that they are owed the bodies of other people, they lash out because they want someone to blame for their own unhappiness. The onus of their own interpersonal issues is somehow laid upon women and men they deem too attractive to be apart of their in group  ( some incels even claimed dylan wasnt a ""trucell"" because he was too attractive.)

I'm also jelous of men whith better social skills than mine, they interact with the gals in a way that it seems to be so natural, they have a power I'll never reach, I feel inferior to them (one of my few friends is a real player and he has no idea that I envy him)  

No matter how hard I try to keep a positive attitude to stop thinking of girls and stop caring about dating and getting laid  I'm still sorrowful, I'd made an effort in order to be nice and extrovert but I guess chicks believe that I'm faking it because they always ""run away"" from me and my entire life has been like that (except with women who are part of my family) since junior high and now that I'm working I jus't don't know how to interact with them.  At the office the few girls I get along with tell me the obvious solutions: ""go there and talk to them no matter if they reject you""  but my mind feels now... I don't know like defeated, so many rejections throughout my life.

I really would love to simply get rid of this desire of feeling what female company is like, what it feels to have a sexual encounter without paying for it, to feel that I'm attractive for once in my life (only in junior high some girls told me that I was handsome) and as I said at the beggining I'm scared to watch the video because I don't want to continue living my life full of hate and under pressure, I don't want to end up like that. Having aspergs and being an incel is screwing me up and so far I'm being unable to find a solution by myself.

I'm normal looking. I've never had muscles, i don't even exercize, i'm not fat but i'm a bit overweight, i have a very dad bod like sagging belly. I certainly look no better or worse than the guy in this video (well i'd definitely say worse now at my age). I have avoidant personality disorder and some people have suspected i may be on the spectrum. i have no real social life to speak of that isn't online.  I was single (and a virgin) until age 22 but in the past 17 years i've been single only for a total of 6 months and i have had 5 relationships among which my current one which is on its tenth year. (oh and NO they aren't online relationships)

My point? Chad is a construct of your mind. It's you, it's only you. It's not women. FOr one they are not one rigid concept. There's billions of them. And they dont' all think the same and want the same thing. Same as men. But i will say this, i'm a good person (it sounds vain but i know that much about me and i KNOW the ""im a nice guy"" cliche, im not a saint, but i know i'm kind because i believe that kindness is what makes the world work), i am reasonably intelligent and i have, i've been told,  a good sense of humor. In short, i have a decent personality and i can feel empathy and relate to people. THAT is the only thing keeping you.

Stop thinking that there aren't women out there who can relate to you and  that they all expect a super stud. I'm the furthest from one, I will say this, without the internet i'd still be single. Because yes i am also awkward socially but online i can let people know exactly who i am. Oh and all this time i was single? I never once thought the issue was women. I knew it was because of my problems i was not allowing any to know me properly and sometimes it made me appear creepy.  It's crazy but when you don't go for the belief that everyone else is  the problem and keeping you down, then you get the idea that maybe it's just you and it's a LOT easier to change yourself than the rest of the world. Though in a lot of incels case my belief is they don't even need to change themselves much, they just need to stop believing there's something very wrong with them.",0,2,2018-08-09T00:35:23.000Z

The issue is that incels are born from a number of things. Its not just about not getting sex but its about how females generally treat them. Females tend to have no conscious or compassion for a man who is awkward or commit social faux pax. A female will mistreat a dude in a number of different scenarios from a guy that approaches them in a bar to a dude who is customer at a store and the female is acting as customer service rep. This is a real thing and women intentially are abusive and disrespectful to men they dont know at first meeting in a number or cases collectively within the culture. Women never actually make friends with men like this or who are out of the norm because of their own narcissism or lack of understanding or everything. They are not built to actually make the environment better but to sit and wait for other people to do it and move in an reap the rewards of what was built. That is why you are not seeing any issues with females because the culture has so crippled men and raised the value of the most average or below average women that even the ugliest and obese female can find a man if he is sex starved enough or just had a bad life dealing with women in general that he can easily be manipulated. Its the truth.,43,13,2018-08-08T19:32:21.000Z

I get the pull of online chatrooms and communities when real life social situations are hard or scary for you. I spent a lot of time with ""online friends"" in my teens. My two closest friends are people I met online (though I've spent significant time with them in person since). Social situations are incredibly daunting for me, especially with people I don't know - but in the last few months, as I started nearing 25 and feeling the urgent need to fight my own cycle of depression/isolation/loneliness, I've made intense strides to force myself out into the world and try dating, making friends, going to public spaces, etc. I'm going to an acquaintance's house in a few hours to hang out and play board games, striving toward friendship with real, local people. It isn't easy, but I've learned it's necessary. This whole ""incel"" concept is really upsetting, and it's horrifying that it turns to violence in some cases. You can't just... choose to do nothing and blame everyone else for it. Take some ownership of your life. Try things. The only way to get through isolation is to force yourself outside.

"Not all incels are the same. many are seen ans unconfident/invisible creepy etc. based on their looks, then become like that. many never had sex so of course they focus on it. it's like never having sugar: you'd probably focus on it too.

Many women offer sex to (attractive) criminals they never met & offer to pay their bail to “get raped” by them (Example: Jeremy Meeks, who then became a male model) while many ugly guys with better character, confidence etc. are dismissed based on looks & judged as having less character/confidence, etc. (the Halo effect) & usually, they THEN eventually have less confidence and/or personality. 
Women pretend looks don’t matter but dismiss below average looking men regardless of personality, many studies confirm. Example: livescience.com/58607-mens-looks-may-matter-more-than-personality.html

Studies show attractive people hired sooner, get promotions more quickly, and are paid more. Source: businessinsider.com/attractive-people-are-more-successful-2012-9
If personality can override looks/race:
There’s exceptions to every rule, especially if you’ve $ or status or the girl isn’t too outta your league etc. So rather than claim some minority of cases where “ugly” guys get “hot” girls, have an ugly/skinny Indian or Arab go in person or make a profile & see what % of girls flirt, give their # & agree to date/kiss etc. Show the videos.
Girls will get the best they can get in the following areas, more/less in this order: handsome, tall, fit, wealthy, high status. THEN there’s some subjective, side factors like her preferred race/fashion/personality/beliefs etc.

Since the first years of middle school I have always been told by girls that I am attractive (probably as attractive as the guy in this interview) and many cute girls tried to approach me during the years of school. I was too picky though. But I didn't want to admit it, the time was passing by and I used as an excuse for the fact that I wasn't having sex that ""girls only like handsome jerks and not intelligent men like me"". A part of me still think that but I'm changing my mind gradually. I started to see things from a different prospective, I am the one that needs to improve. Stop blaming girls, stop being too picky, look beyond a person appearance, build more self confidence. That's what I did and I got very good results almost immediately.

"These people dont need to get laid. You dont hear any of these guys complain that they arent able to produce a sustainable income or that they cant make a meaningful connection with others, and this is what they need to do. These are useless men who cant provide, and they expect sex. Yes, some men are attractive and can easily get laid, but this is not the majority. These are people with big egos and low ambitions, and they are professional victims. Sex is not the objective of life. What about people born with chronic illnesses that shorten their lifespan and affect their quality of life? Do they complain that nobody will have sex with them?

This documentary is soul wrenching. These poor people have no real helping hand other than people who are in just as desperate states and yet some will still look down on them. Maybe we should see someone in need and spare our efforts on helping them. Even if they self destruct it is still more than a chance than they have now of become a responsible human. If you can't empathise with someone who cant help themselves don't be surprised that they won't care about the rest of the world. Tragic.,22,3,2018-08-08T17:53:58.000Z

"All this ""incel mythology"" of ""Chads"" and what not is pretty accurate in regards to how relative strangers interact with one another, don't tell me you would notice a regular guy over a very attractive guy in a club or otherwise among relative strangers. Sometimes interactions with strangers IS your entire social-life though.
These people are lonely mostly, true social-isolation, no friends or interactions at all, is not something you hear much about for obvious reasons. It's something really affects the core of a personality and psychology though, when there is nobody to empathize with, there is no empathy and at the same time you become more and more sensitive in all kinds of social interactions, you become more and more likely to be awkward and more and more distraught at the idea of being awkward which leads you to elude people, and without empathy you are a psychopath but still you aren't and you develop some kind of ""Taxi Driver"" complex, of being a psychopath/savior hybrid, ""Some day a real rain will come and wipe all this scum of the earth"". All the while you are going through these very pathological feelings that are solved so easily, people expect the same from you as from all other normal people, and will sort of sniff out your anxiety and decide they don't like you, or if you actually tell them you are lonely, most of the time they will take the word of whomever rejected you previously and decide they don't like you.

"As a 22 year old guy who has suffered from social anxiety for years and has had minimal luck with dating or women in general, I have never come across the term ""incel"". I became more familiar with this movement's ideology when that lunatic with the van unleashed a campaign murdering and injuring innocent people in Toronto where I am from. 

Incels are insecure, lack empathy and  have unrealistic expectations! They tend to target the most physically attractive women and expect these women to come knocking on their doors and spread their legs. No woman should have to deal with psychopaths that live in their mom's basement using the internet 24/7, don't have a job to sustain basic income, a post secondary education and  have no interesting hobbies. 

The reality is that you can still have a productive life without having to worry about dating and getting laid by women. I understand sex is a part of our  natural instinct and sometimes a necessity but it isn't everything in life. I have learned to pursue other passions/hobbies in life like obtaining a financially stable career, reading books, nature hiking and playing sports instead of wasting my precious time on chasing women and  relationships that will go nowhere in the long run.",0,0,2018-08-08T16:45:58.000Z

Then they complain on social media how guys are all the same. If girls weren't so superficial in this generation, then there wouldn't be any incels. It's not about having sex. They could hire hookers for that.",2,0,2018-08-08T16:45:19.000Z

If he was black? They would be making excuses for why hes unemployed, why he uses horrible language and disrespects women, why hes even a criminal in some cases. 


They would expect some social program to solve it, not the black man himself, who is responsible for his own success and failure in life just like the white incel shown here. Also I'm sure there would he plenty if blaming ""the system"" and blaming ""white people"".


In reality, just like the pathetic fool above, a black person is responsible for their success, their failure, whether they're employed or not, whether they behave well or are above the law or not, etc. Yet several videos on this very channel try and preach excuses and racist double standards, and passing off blame from the individual. 



But if it's a loser white dude? He must die and is a school shootery by default apparently. By that logic, all black men are threats to be involved in gang shootings.

"People are saying these guys should ""just get help"", but you're missing an important component to that plan: real social pressure that these guys care about. They have no immediate social circle that wants to see them succeed (or threatens to cut ties should they not make the effort), so there's no one to push them into that terrible territory that is going through therapy. So none of them will do it. They can't see the benefit to doing so (since they believe their status in the social hierarchy is the result of something like a biological determinism), and they have no examples in their social circles - primary, secondary or even tertiary - to show them that dealing with your problems in an empirical and productive way actually works. So they don't. They just learn to deal with the pain (like the guy in the video) or they give up entirely and commit suicide or, rarely, take their anger out on other people.

Videos like this one don't help. They frame the problem the wrong way; the anger on women is a smoke screen for the real problem, which is a complete lack of ability to connect emotionally with anyone who isn't basically exacltly like them. Why the focus on women? Because you're truly an ""adult"" when you're grown up, and in a stable relationship with a woman. It seems that, to them, if they could simply find a partner, their problems would be solved in an instant. What they fail to realise - or have perhaps already realised, but have repressed deeply - is that the correct order is the exact opposite. 

Nothing will change until the public discourse changes from ""incels are angry terrorist losers who hate women"" to ""incels are angry, mentally unwell young men without a social support network and no real hope of fitting in with the world, which is all they really want"".

But let's do the opposite, let's try and understand them as individuals. Because the more we shit on them, the more the (already shit) Shituation will worsen. And not out of fear that they will shoot as. But out of actual trying to understand. My point is I don't really think that's representing ALL of the incels. One Size Fit All tactics wont really work. Maybe some sort of actual psychologists trying to lay down some facts. Maybe actual reaserch on their psychology could help.

"I think that the main problem with these guys is that they don't have any game with the girls, if you know what I mean. 
That double talk where both parties keep on issuing dubious meaning chatter aimed at 
1. scanning the other guy's intention
2. providing the person who talks with a safe face by claiming the innocent version is the correct one
3. getting the information across that ""if you're game, then I'm game""
And sex is a consensual thing - otherwise it's a criminal act. 
And yes, there's women that, even if you say that your statements were innocent in nature, they'll use it to attack the guy - yet that's part of the game. Remember 1. scanning the other guy's intention? 
A guy with good game knows that it's always a minefield out there. 
The main problem with Incels is that most women they seem to have a radar that can easily spot danger. 
And Incels being mostly lonely antisocial guys : that's danger in most women's books as in  potential creep who will keep women locked in a basement. 
So, Incels, it's bullshit.  It's not involuntary.

I don't think that they necassarily want sex itself but a relationship where they feel cherished and loved. They might lose track of the definition of love and build up anger and selfhate. 

What incel's probably have problems understanding might be that FRIENDS/FAMILY could also love you the same way as your partner. Does sex really matter then if you have friends/family who love you for who you are? 
A partner shouldn't be defined by sexual favors nor should any incel be defined as a sexist. I think they're just frustrated and look for reasons why ''noone'' loves them. (chad/woman in general)

I hate this culture of self hatred. Its unhealthy. All this chad nonsense  needs to stop. Personality and most importantly confidence are what make anyone attractive. Look at all the 'sexy' men from history and celebrities today. Their outward confidence is what draws people to them. Joking about violence and deep self hatred do nothing for interpersonal skills. For that you need to go outside and stop seeing every person as a threat or a sex object,128,20,2018-08-08T08:26:34.000Z

I’m also too scared to approach them (comes from being teased and bullied by girls all the time as a kid). I learned to just live with it, sex isn’t all there is to life and I think the society we live in today really pushes the fact that to be a real man you have to be sleeping with a shit ton of woman throughout most of your twenties. In reality this is rarely the case, you’ll find most guys in their 20s (even the player types) will lie about the amount of girls they are sleeping with to their friends (who are usually lying too so they also don’t feel left out). From the 4 times I’ve had sex I learned that it’s not that great unless it’s with the right person , no matter how good looking they are. Also just being friends with a woman is not the end of the world, they are people too a lot of them are cool af and the energy a nice, down to earth woman brings around can be a relief when you’re friends with guys that can’t hold a conversation when it’s not about putting their dicks in something.",1,3,2018-08-08T02:28:35.000Z

"As a woman who is not really hot (like guys stare all the time, getting hit on all the time. I have hot friends and I've seen what happens) I also get friend zoned by men and actually have yet to have sex (I'm 19 so it's pretty embarrassing). I hear guys complain about women liking the ""hot"" guys all the time. Most of my girl friends like normal looking guys, they don't need a guy to have a six pack or whatever. I think what guys get wrong is focusing SO MUCH on how a woman looks themselves, if they didn't go for the most conventionally attractive woman (who is usually not very interesting) then they wouldn't be disappointed. No one is saying ask out girls with 1 tooth or body odor just lower your expectations. Bc most ppl aren't ""Staceys"" or ""Chads"" so stop trying to get them, just stick with a normal girl, we normally have great personalities and also don't care if you have abs.

*also if girls aren't really liking you it may actually have more to do with your personality. I know many guys who are just fine physically but they act as if they are entilted to my company or body bc they flirt with me or give me attention, or are just boring or self-centered. You can be average looking and find a girl, what will lower your chances significantly is being bad company. If you're average looking having a shit personality makes you unattractive. Work on yourself before you start blaming others for your shortcomings. I've been doing that (trying harder with my appearance and social skills) and I'm a lot closer to being a non-virgin as I was a couple years ago haha.",3,3,2018-08-08T00:57:28.000Z

By the way, I spent some significant time on their largest forum, almost none of them idolize Elliot Rodgers, they think he had mental problems and wanted everything handed to him (he never approached a single woman in his life) a lot of these guys have tried approaching hundreds and even up to a thousand with no success. They do vary a lot, the suicidal thing does seem to be a minority, but a strong minority, maybe 10 or 20 percent which is a lot as big as their community is. Others want to get plastic surgery, get on steroids or move to another country where their lack of height or ethnicity will not be as much of a hindrance.

 but if they can't so much as leave their homes, or if they refuse to make an effort to change their lifestyles, they can't find help. that's the sad part.",132,91,2018-08-08T00:11:02.000Z

"The part at around 6 minutes is just the whole issue in a few frames. He's laughing his ass off and she's backing away disgusted.

These creeps don't think they should change when it turns out they're wrong in their world views. They think the world needs to change or change back to fit theirs.

Perfect example:
I have never met a woman IN MY LIFE outside of sex worker friends and loved ones that have had anywhere NEAR ""100s of sex partners."" That's not to say they don't exist or are wrong for doing it. The exact opposite actually. Everyone of those consensual acts was their choice, and while I'm sure there's more than a couple of regrets in those ranks I GAURENTEE you none of them are because big bad liberal feminist or feminism tricked them. 

To be honest though I'd care alot more about helping these creeps, as well as I'm sure other men and even women, if there wasn't so much hate directed outward at everybody not fucking them. Like it's something they're entitled to. 

But that's probably not going to change is it? Why look at yourself and realize people don't want to be around you because you have a repulsive personality? When there is someone already there waiting to explain how not only is it not your fault... ""It the WOMZ! or the CHADZ. You see the women are too stupid for your brilliant Rick and Morty fanfiction. They only want the CHADZ with the muscles and the nice cars and the influence "" etc etc

You know if there are ANY halfway decent people in these groups genuinely looking for advice let me give you some. This isn't the place to find it. This is either going to alienate you too or worse you're eventually going to believe their bullshit after following their terrible advice and it not working. ""You see"" they'll say. ""We told you how the CHADZ catch the females"" because they HAVE to be derogatory to women at every opportunity ""and it didn't work out for you because all the bullshit we've been telling you"". It's pretty close to cults and how they convince themselves that their leader is ""the chosen"" or whatever bullshit.

Second. Women MEAN IT when they say be yourself but that doesn't mean you are absolutely perfect and your views on everything are 100% right. No it means don't try to act like someone you THINK they want. It's not hard to see past and is INCREDIBLY CREEPY when someone does. It raises several questions like ""Why are they lying to me?"" Sadly usually the best case scenario is that you just want to get into their pants but it can be just as likely you could mean them harm.

Third. It is NEVER a woman's fault for not liking you. Under any circumstances. Even if they are exactly the kind of woman your incel buddies tell you about and all they want is sex, money, and power and you don't have those things guess what! 

Fourth. Finding any kind of romance is hard. You have to put yourself out there and when it doesn't work out or you're rejected it can hurt. That's life. The first time I was on a bike I cracked my head open. My first sexual experience didn't turn out... Much better. But I kept putting myself out there and I've been with some AMAZING women. I don't mean I just slept with them. I mean we truly cared about each other and had a deep connection. While none of those turned out to work long term I wouldn't take one of them back.",0,0,2018-08-08T00:07:07.000Z

Most of the ones I've spoken to have looked down on me and when I try to assert myself they threaten to use their ""connections"" against me, which is a myriad of people who go to the gym. I lived at the bottom of the hierarchy in my house, always constantly looked down upon by my female family members (I can at least brush off dad but my mom and sister got me to the breaking point and I couldn't do anything physically nor orally to stop it). School didn't help as I was largely ignored by the girls, even by ones I approached. It was like I never existed in their eyes. Even when my image changed, it was like I could never rid myself of this shroud. I started working out, grades got good and even when I approached girls its like they would forget, and if I got too excessive I always feared that they would call up or spread bad rumors about me, and my school had a fuckload of whiteknights so I didn't want to die. Only a few women in my life have ever treated me as an equal, and as an obvious consequence I can only form lasting relationships with men, not gay relationships but ones where I at least feel that I am equal and heard.

"These guys are mostly autistic and simply cannot compete in the age of Tinder and female choosiness. In a different world, in the 1950s even, they'd have been paired off and this would have improved their social development. They'd have had a chance at starting a family and fulfilling their most basic drives and hopes. Today? We're atomized and it's every man for himself. There's little hope for these males and it's unfortunate. Their situation is even more depressing when one considers the degree to which everything has been sexualized. Without having had sex, it seems like an amazing thing. After having had sex, most people, males, realize it's nice but not transcendental or anything. It's impossible to reach the latter stage without at least fucking a few girls.

They're not incorrect about young females. Fucking 20 by 20 isn't uncommon and it's entirely disgusting. I started dating a 21-year-old without realizing the extent of her past -- she twice contracted chlamydia and, when I broke it off, slept with at least 3 or 4 guys and contracted chlamydia again (which prompted her to warn me and which I avoided). At 30, I can say pretty definitively -- based on my experiences at least -- that females under 25 have reached previously unknown levels of whoredom.

"Let's say that some of these ""incels"" don't do any of the weird things like the ones do in this video.  They don't partake in pervserse toilet humor or deficate themselves on webcam.  They don't confine themselves to their bedrooms everyday.  They don't spend their waking moments spouting anger and violence against anyone.  They have gainful employment, or are in the process of attaining such through higher education or vocational training.  They have hobbies that interest them and make them content.  They treat people decently and with the same respect that they want for themselves.  

But, somehow, they still do not measure up.  They are considered ""boring"" because they naturally do not have an inclination to talk at length about any random subject, nor the ability to present conversation in an exciting way.  They are ""socially awkward"" because their natural speaking abilities include stuttering, speaking too softly, having a type of voice that is not pleasant to the ear, or having a natural posture that is not appealing to the eyes.  They are ""unconfident"" because they don't always have the right response to every question, are not naturally funny, or just don't have much to talk about.  All of these things combined arbitrarily classify the men in question as ""creepy.""  This an unfair, dehumanizng term that is assigned invariably to men who cannot find a way to not be ""boring,"" ""socially awkward,"" and ""unconfident.""

This term, I imagine, manifests in these guys' minds with little or no recourse.  In doing so, their emotional statuses turn violent.  They take what they have been labeled and turn it on those who have dehumanized them as a form of retribution.

"As I watch this, I am acutely reminded of the incessant whining by Lindy West, Amanda Marcotte, and so many other physically unattractive women who complain how unfair it is that men have an unfavorable opinion about their weight and overall appearance, even though men have the absolute right to reject what they find repulsive in women (just as women do with men they find repulsive).  Yet, they have been given a platform to shame, insult, ridicule, and socially/emotionally coerce men into dating women they do not naturally find attractive.  

It is ironic when men (who are inherently unattractive) are having such a hard time navigating the complex, mind-racking dating world, these women throw it back in their faces and tell them that the onus is on them to change, even though much of what they expect men to change is not pratical nor morally feasible.  But when women are in the same situation as these men, people take sympathy with them and direct blame at men for not forcing themselves to find them attractive.

"It’s not just from being celibate, it’s the inability to have meaningful relationships with anybody, not just women. Being alone all the time hurts, not having friends to talk to hurts, and that can lead to drastic choices. It’s not all about the absence of sex, because even after you get it, you’re still empty and dead inside. The lack of empathy one can develop makes it even worse, suicide starts to become more and more prevalent in your mind and after a while it becomes not so drastic of a path to take. But eh, it is what it is, a person is not entitled to have friends or a lover, and if they choose not to go out and make meaningful relationships, then living out a life alone is a possibility, some can handle that fact and some can’t.",0,0,2018-08-07T22:16:59.000Z

"Honestly, I can’t say I understand them completely, but if you have a conversation with one of these people (and I mean if you manage finding one who’s not too deep into the rabbit hole and will actually be open to talking to you) and you’ve dealt with depression and self-loathing, you might find a lot of things in common. Like, a lot. I was impressed by how relatable one of these guys was to me, and I’m a woman. 
I’m not saying they’re all poor victims or something, but I think exchanging civilized messages with an incel really helped me understand them at least on some level. These people really need help, but I’m not saying it in a dismissive way. They’re people failed by society. Not because they’re not getting laid, but because of mental illness that goes untreated or treated badly. I really feel for a lot of them. 
And then there are those who are so knee deep and rejecting any kind of help and contact with reality that... I honestly cannot vibe with them. 
But that one guy I talked to really made me think, and we had a beautiful conversation. I really think about it a lot. 

Please, stop mocking people. Regardless of who they are. If you’re the kind of person who would kick someone who’s already down, then you’re not the one on a moral high ground. 
And anyway, this is only marginally about sex. The misogyny and entitlement are there, but to reduce these people’s problems to not getting laid is very, very naïf. There are other problems that some of them might not want to recognize or can’t. Most of this community is one formed around a sense of helplessness, loneliness and isolation. They don’t need pity or mocking, I think they need genuine connection with other people outside of the internet. 

of course, if a guy can sit in his room for days on end with a MacBook and without working, there’s also a huge thing to factor in: they can afford it and someone is probably supporting them economically, like their parents, so... I also don’t really want to pity someone who’s privileged like that while other people would either suck it up and look for a job and be around other people just to survive, or be homeless. The incel community exists because enough middle-upper class men can afford this kind of lifestyle, I think.",0,0,2018-08-07T20:34:33.000Z

"I have asperger and depression. I had my first girlfriend at 13 but always sucked at socializing with women. Always ending up been hate by them months  latter.  But Then at my 18 years old I had an awakening. Now I just talk to girls on anime events or even at the bus stop and get their number and become close friends. I met a girl with anime pins at a bus stop and we become boyfriends for several months in which we met each other after highschool and spent time together. Recently I talk to a girl in anime festival and went with her  on a date and another  anime festival latter on. We hug each other a lots and she is really shy and cute. I think she probably likes me and I like her :3
So as you see it's not imposible to get out of this self induced idea that you can't have a girlfriend and that women hate you.

It’s so funny how they’re called involuntary celibates, hahaha he even said they’re not virgins by choice, they’ve tried to get laid and just can’t. 
That’s what leads me to believe it’s more about the way they act towards and treat women because it can’t just be because they’re “nerdy” or whatever. One of my best boyfriends to date was a super nerdy guy I was friends with in high school but he gained more confidence after high school so we became more than friends because he was finally able to open up and be confident.

The issue with these incels seem to revolve around self-hatred and low self-esteem, and these feelings have manifested into a severe depression that they can't break out of. Also, these incel forums and chat rooms seem extremely detrimental to incels because it essentially serves as an echo chamber and justifies their antisocial and avoidance tendencies as well as their delusional beliefs.

I also hate when people say that incels should ""get help"", although they desperately need it saying someone needs to get help is so ambiguous...The best thing for these people would be for them to eat healthy, exercise consistently, and develop a skill so that they can actually bring something to the table...and if it doesn't get them laid, it will still be beneficial to their physical health and success.

Also, it's quite disturbing to see guys that THINK they know what women want & then fail while using their logic.

"Horrible video. You guys didn't even discuss why they are incels in the first place.

This shit starts with basically normal guys being rejected over and over and sometimes women even bully them.

If a guy is still a Virgin by 20, then that's a problem by most women standards.

This incel movement is alot more complex then some losers that don't know how to talk to women.

Most of these guys come from single mother households. Most of these guys grew up being taught that to get a girl that you should treat them with respect and be yourself.

And anyone that really knows how to get women knows that's the opposite as we see many women sleep around with dead beats, guys who beats them, guys who cheat on them ect...

Some of this is mental illness and some of this is the consequences of our society glorifying women to be single parents. Not to mention all the other feminist bullshit we have going on.

Point I'm making is incels is alot more complicated then losers hating women because they aren't getting on laid.

"Just a tip for anyone who comes close to vibing with these fools: 1) relationships are more than sex. In fact, you should not even thinking about it. You should be thinking about the experiences you and another share. 2) nobody, and I mean nobody, likes someone with no backbone or confidence. Full stop. You can make being docile seem ""endearing"" and ""pure"", but it is possible to be kind and still be confident.
For example, my best friend is probably the sweetest guy you'll ever meet. He'd literally give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. But he's also one of the most confident guys I've ever met because he knows that his words and his actions carry weight.

The echo chamber effect is alive and well on those forums too.

Like it or not, these phenomena are linked, they are not separate. And don't misunderstand me, I'm by no means equating one group with the other.

If we show solidarity for one we should do so for the other no matter how excessive, understand the roots of this suffering which are very much linked.

"My thoughts (that are not meant to offend anyone!) What I find interesting is...okay, last fall I went and took a look at the incel Reddit page out of curiosity. I was struck at how many/most of them spoke as if they were extremely ugly/unattractive. But watching this video, seeing this guy (as well as the murdering van guy) and some of the dudes on the screen of the chatroom---these are not unattractive guys at all. I guess they've really just had tons of bad luck/low self esteem or other contributing factors to their lack of success, and it makes them think they are really ugly? I'm sure there are some who might be unattractive, but it's just a surprising contrast to see them in person versus how they talk about themselves. I remember also being struck at just how plain miserable they all seemed. I saw a lot more misery and hopelessness than anything else. I do think there's a danger in commiserating with other toxic people, and I can see how one more violent type could influence/empower the others. At the same time, I can see the need to have likeminded people to vent to. I don't know. I just feel that spending a lot of time talking to other unhappy hopeless angry people that feed off each other about how much women suck and how much other men suck and how much their own lives are doomed to forever suck is not healthy (and probably just adds to the probs) and hope they can find other ways to improve their lives. For example, I had some problems growing up with a certain kind of parent (narcissistic, emotionally abusive, who knows). If I were to spend the majority of my social life talking to other people who had this same kind of childhood (and our main topics were always about the damages and injustices we endured lol), it might keep me stuck in a bad place and perpetually keep me in a horrible mood. So, that's what I mean. Talking to like-minded people with similar problems in small doses is helpful at first because it makes you realize you are not alone and you can get some venting out. But too MUCH focus on something that makes you miserable is unhealthy and  harmful .",1,4,2018-08-07T09:05:17.000Z

"I'm not an incel, and I agree that the wrong attitude makes a man far less likely to find a partner, however there are other things to it.
OkCupid made a survey to see how men and women rate the attractiveness of people of the other sex: while men rated women very equally, placing 50% of them below average and 50% above average, women only rated 20% of men above average, while the other 80% was below.
Now, OkCupid is a huge dating site with millions of users, so it's fair to assume that the population is very homogeneous, so the data is realistic.

Most incels exist because they do have self esteem problems, but the fact that the game is geared against them is also a factor to be considered.
Concepts like ""Stacy"" and ""Chad"" are obviously stereotypes, however remember that every stereotype is based on reality, albeit very exaggerated.

There are also other factors that play into the incel problem, mostly given by the huge societal changes we experienced in the last century, but I'm not going to write about them because a YouTube comment is inappropriate to give the arguments their proper weight.

"The guy actually seemed kind of sweet. I've dealt with social anxiety pretty much my entire life, in addition to a lot of other things.  I know how tough it can be. My issue with normal, non-violent incels is their stereotyping of women in terms of our wants and desires. I acknowledge that it is easier for a woman to find a sexual partner, put that down to whatever reason you want, but it does not mean that women can't deal with the same obstacles as incels that prevent them from finding partners, such as anxiety, depression, autism and low self image. I think that the difference is that society teaches women that everything ""wrong"" with them is their own fault, whereas men more often are taught that they deserve certain things from life, simply because they exist and have urges. I don't think this applies to everybody, but it seems to be true in a lot of cases, whether they are incels, chads or normies. Going back to my point about stereotyping wants and desires. It doesn't matter which of the three categories you fall into, if you act like an asshole, only other assholes will like you. Yes, a lot of women tend to fall for conventionally attractive men, but it's the same the other way around. I am personally much more attracted to a people's minds than their appearance. I don't understand why people insist upon being with somebody they have nothing in common with just because a certain type of person is valued by society based on their appearance. If you just want sex, hire a prostitute. If you want love you need to sit down and think about what you actually want from a relationship. If you don't want to be treated like shit, don't treat other people like shit. Acknowledge that most people just want love and respect. I know it might seem like you've been dealt a bad hand and that the world is against you, but many people have been dealt worse and still come out on top. Hell, I feel like that a lot of the time, but the world is not that black and white. Either do your best to conform (which I know doesn't make me happy)  or change your expectations of what  a partner should be. You might realise along the way that happiness doesn't aways come from other people. Try new things that you might enjoy, and if you're lucky, you find find somebody to enjoy them with.",0,0,2018-08-07T07:36:26.000Z

And as far as the argument that they should just stop acting like asshats, I agree. But since sjw culture has become such a shit show towards white males for no reason other than their race & gender, I can understand why many of them don't even try to behave otherwise.

For me that was a ”hell no.” I remained a virgin until my husband, and while yes there are some girls that have sex with anyone I was never that kind of girl. Also I wonder how many of these guys only want girls with perfect skin, perfect bodies, lots of makeup, whatever. Because if you aren't very attractive it's unlikely you're going to get a girl who's an 8, more like a 6. But honestly a lot of these guys aren't bad looking, they just hate women and we can sense that from a mile away.

"“While the noble man lives in trust and openness with himself (gennaios 'of noble descent' underlines the nuance 'upright' and probably also 'naïve'), the man of ressentiment is neither upright nor naive nor honest and straightforward with himself. His soul squints; his spirit loves hiding places, secret paths and back doors, everything covert entices him as his world, his security, his refreshment; he understands how to keep silent, how not to forget, how to wait, how to be provisionally self-deprecating and humble. A race of such men of ressentiment is bound to become eventually cleverer than any noble race; it will also honor cleverness to a far greater degree: namely, as a condition of existence of the first importance; while with noble men cleverness can easily acquire a subtle flavor of luxury and subtlety—for here it is far less essential than the perfect functioning of the regulating unconscious instincts or even than a certain imprudence, perhaps a bold recklessness whether in the face of danger or of the enemy, or that enthusiastic impulsiveness in anger, love, reverence, gratitude, and revenge by which noble souls have at all times recognized one another. Ressentiment itself, if it should appear in the noble man, consummates and exhausts itself in an immediate reaction, and therefore does not poison: on the other hand, it fails to appear at all on countless occasions on which it inevitably appears in the weak and impotent.”

"Male suicide rate has been increasing since the 90s....

The hardest thing to learn for men, is that the world doesn't give AF about you. And that you have to work to *make* the life you want. (if you are not already rich)

Men without other men to guide them to this realization fall victim to their own minds. 

Some of these ""incel"" beliefs are based in truth sadly....

You do have to look good, have skills and hobbies, and be worth a value finicially, and have certain personality qualities.....

But what's more important than actually being/having those thing, is *working* towards those things. 

Positivity and work ethic draws attention to you.....And with that comes  increased opportunity to build the types of relationships that you would like to have, with the people you want to have them with.

"Incels are a byproduct of the current empowerment of women in this day and age that makes it seem like they have enough leverage to get away with just about anything or at the very least get a diluted version of consequences that would normally leave men displaced and almost feel isolated to the point that them seeking, grasping, for love and affection is them having the minutest of hope that someone out there will care for them. They've deluded themselves into thinking that a right woman will come along eventually until their patience has run thin to the point where they take their frustration and anger and turn it inward, eventually exploding into the type of men, women abhor. What these men fail to realize is that their own self deprecation and lack of self love is what is deteriorating them. 

I would also point out that the way social media is designed it caters to nearly everybody with instant self gratification. With that in mind these men expect the same results, not really putting in any effort to make themselves the type of person that would attract a woman that could see in them as a potential partner. But rather stagnate and blame the world with this victim mentality when they themselves are the reason why they can't ever find someone other then mutual incels to talk about never getting laid. 

But back to my original statement, in today's age where women feel empowered enough to sometimes outright attack a man and come out scottfree. It doesn't help that with these types of group think dominating the morality war of social media it drives these men away in pursuit of their ideal woman and life partner that wont attack them. It's a vicious cycle and I'm sorry to say there doesn't seem to be any solution other then to hope that these people, feminists and incels learn to be better people so that in the end they can reach their desired destination without sparking a war between the sexes.",16,3,2018-08-07T04:59:16.000Z

Also, unlike basement dwelling neckbeards, many incels are into self-improvement type stuff like fashion and grooming (""looksmaxxing"") and fitness (""gymcelling"").

 In this unfair world you got to show your worth. Yes you shouldn't have to do that but that is realty. Women want winners. People in general want successful people in their life.

"Damn.  Feel bad for these guys.  It's like, they gotta find something else to be their core belief.  Rejection sucks, yeah.  But still... Stop worrying about what they 'think' someone else likes or what someone else thinks (that whole 'Chad' manifestation is something else!)  What about self-investment & personal development... and doing what you want?  What's wrong with being in shape?  Don't have to be a gym rat;  try to play some sports, hike, kayak, bike, ski.  Make the investment in themselves.  Might sound corny but take a cooking class.  Don't be afraid of failure.  Maybe get a motorcycle.  Take the lesson and get a bike.  Sometimes I wonder if people want to take ownership or admit that it's ok not to know something.  I said 'take the lesson' to get your bikers license because people have to learn shit.  And there's nothing wrong with not knowing something, and nothing good typically comes easy or without effort.  It takes work to be in shape.  It takes work (literally) for most people to have money.  And if you don't know how to get in shape, sounds like this guy's AMerican - he can get a personal trainer.  He can research how to learn more skills to maybe make money.  Getting money usually takes work.  And... being healthy mentally takes work.  There's nothing wrong if they see a therapist.  I hope that these guys discover a way to be the best version of themselves that they can be.  The good news is they seem somewhat aware that there's room for improvement.

Otherwise, sitting in front of a computer with a bunch of guys lamenting about a fictional caricature that's 'successful' with women, and attacking that caricatures core belief system and women - I don't think that's going to get them anywhere.

"I honestly believe feminists are a big reason we have a lot of incel communities now. We didn't really hear much about incels prior to feminism slowly integrating into the mainstream media (which started around 2014)

Feminism has been consistently teaching women to distrust men and that men are guilty until proven innocent. For regular men, dating can be difficult but for men that are socially inept, and/or have severe social anxiety, mental disabilities like autism/aspergers, it's nothing more than a pipedream. These type of men would voice their frustration with how they don't understand why women found them creepy when they weren't trying to be creepy but may have ended up giving a creepy vibe. Nobody gave them actual advice. They would either shame them for being a virgin or they would say ""it's simple dur just dont be creepy lul"" (ignoring the fact that a person can give out a creepy vibe due to them being insecure and the other women picking up on their insecurity as opposed to the guy intentionally trying to be predatory).

Feminists were usually the ones to shame men that tried talking to women, whether it be a man talking to a woman on the subway, at a coffee shop, etc, and claim that talking to women outside of a social gathering is 'inappropriate' and liken it to 'catcalling'. The result of that is these type of men believing they were justified in continuing to isolate themselves from society. Then feminists had the nerve to give them the 'pull yourself up by your own bootstraps' spiel and tell these men that they need to man up and quit being pussies and just talk to women instead of blaming them for their problems. 

The end result is a bunch of insecure, self-loathing, socially inept men that want to talk to women but can't because they're afraid of coming off as creepy. It becomes this vicious cycle since they can't socialize because their lack of confidence and social skills will turn women off but at the same time, not socializing is going to make your confidence and social skills worse (considering that you only get good at socializing by actually socializing).


Even if you want to argue that feminists aren't responsible partially for creating incels, you should atleast admit that they sure as hell made the problem a lot more worse than it needed to be.",0,0,2018-08-06T21:07:50.000Z

"Sorry for bad spelling or english but Just had to repost,

The lack of empathy some of these people especially the women in the comments have that I can clearly see, that they don't realize the comments like the ones they are making are the exact fuel of why incels are feeling so ostracized and have such low confidence and even hate women in some cases.
 
They are clearly being generalized and demonized by people who don't even know them or don't want to know them or understand them, they don't want to empathize at all about how they got there and what they've been though to make them like this. 

Incels use the term ""Roasties"" to identify the types of women he talked about in the video, the very promiscuous type. They make fun of these because its a coping mechanism that obviously helps them forget the fact that they've missed the prime time of their lives for interaction and sex (i.e 15-19) when everyone else was getting together and having fun while their peers made fun of them, their looks their stature and told them they were worthless so they couldn't compete in those days. And that's why they think looks are everything, its because of these types of people engraining it into their heads. Because of the people right now here who are making comments like stated before. And to all the people like that, you might not think you contribute much to that but it really does add up, all those 20ish years they've lived and still being judged so quickly and people making guesses on how they live their lives, telling them to just do things they've already tried 100 times over flaunting their morally higher than thou attitude.

The bottom line is Incels really do want meaningful and real relationships, it's just hard for them because everyone has this idea of them only thinking about sex. And maybe some of them do, but the majority just want someone who can mutually support them.

When they say things like they just want to have sex, its because we know that sex is the most intimate thing that a couple has. It really deepens the bonds and connection between the two people and you feel safe, loved and trusted. Which is why a girlfriend doesn't go around having sex with people who are not their boyfriends unless the love is fake. This is why they hate the ""Roastie"" types, they see that these promiscuous people are really taking for granted how easy it is for them to sleep around and not have meaningful emotional connections since they sleep around a lot. It makes them angry that they want someone to really love and support but everyone else is taking it for granted. A lot of incels then become really desperate and give up on life as YES it is an important part of social life, and they will never get it.

This is the part when they are desperate and have given up when the world tells them they're not good enough. When they try but fail and people think they don't try at all which kills their self-esteem even more. 
Thats when they really do say they just want to have sex. And admit theat they will have sex with the roasties while still hating them. This is the reason they have a low opinion of these promiscuous women. Because they feel like these are the women making fun of them, these are the women then having sex with the other lucky people not getting as much bullshit as they do socially, these are the people who are so privileged that they don't value their most intimate way for emotional connection to another person. But they have no other option.

Sex is a thing that couples do that really seals their trust and deepens the relationship. Incels don't have this, and they know they will never have this because of past experiences. They band together as a male group then because only they can support themselves because everyone else is too busy making fun of them. Though males don't like to show themselves emotionally fully, so its all very jokey within their circle which combined with the internet makes a very edgy and unstable chaotic community but it doesn't make all the individuals bad people.

Just stating what I think from experience and friends too. 

But honestly some of these people actually do not try at all, but even if they look like they don't I don't think its fair or healthy to ridicule them because you don't know the whole story and making stuff up about them will just make it worse. When people criticize their behaviors they really need to look at why they became this way. who they latched that attitude from. They had been getting made fun of all their lives for their looks and such, and now, as a result, their attitudes have been warped because they see remember those looked down on them and others. they see that it was those people getting all the sex and relationships, the ones who are ""Alpha"" which is a word they have for it, and they try to emulate it warping their own personalities, it happens subconsciously and psychologically. And that's where it becomes really really unhealthy.",0,0,2018-08-06T21:03:31.000Z

"They build their ideologies on caricatures that live inside their restricted minds. Restricted because they're unable to see things as they really are, they lack skills of observation, and their logic is undeniably poor, they truly think things just happen for people. For some it's easy to get certain things, but for most they have to work hard, increasingly putting themselves out of their comfort zones. I'm sure they believe they are showing what happens when men don't get sex, however they are prime examples of people who refuse to take responsibility for their lives, and therefore bathe in the comfort of victimhood. They're weighed down by shame, and the hyperfocus on sex being some kind of answer for 'the meaning of life', is only making it worse. Men's greatest fear when communicating with women is being sexually humiliated. Fear and shame are the reasons why they are like this, the cause of their mental illnesses. The reason why it's so hard to fix with these idiots is because they truly believe that they deserve a right to someone's body. There's so much ego wrapped up in this, they suffer detachment from society, things like agoraphobia, because they do not have a general trust of other people, yet their self esteem is high enough to be able to constantly blame other people for their own problems. They're too stubborn to accept that they need to change. I agree that you can't just ""be yourself"" to get the things you want, but only when you rely on the opinions of other people, and your only intention is to get something out of someone, or in this case stick a body part in someone elses body part. No technique on how to hide that intention will ever work.

Your illness comes from too much focus on sex, not lack of it. And I have never heard of a woman in my entire life who has been ostracised because she had too much sex with too many cartoon 'chads'. If you developed some basic observation skills and genuine and unbiased interest in the way the world works (if you are not too scared to be unbiased that is), then you might notice a lot of things that will completely derail your entire world view, and perhaps allow you to live a successful life.",0,0,2018-08-06T20:28:09.000Z

"The idea that status, looks etc. plays a role in attractiveness to women is partly true, especially in just a sexual manner. But that's just not true that personality doesn't play a HUGE role in staying with a guy. I've turned down enough attractive high-status guys who have the personality of a fence to confirm that. If you think you're not getting anywhere with women and that it has nothing to do with your personality, whilst simultaneously saying you de-personalise when you leave your house and you make ""jokes"" about killing women then you're not very self-aware about the negative things of your personality.

However, I do remember saying ""Just be yourself!"" alot to my guy friends that seemed like the stereotypical nerdy guy.

Thankfully, none of them, as far as I know, became incels. And they are all well adjusted dudes with good careers and social lives years after college.

"I'm a real-life Chad.

Parties make me uncomfortable like every normal sober human being. I've been straight edge my whole life, so being around other drunk people is not my ideal Friday evening. In fact, I prefer my weekly Dungeons and Dragons group. 

I hate energy drinks, and I only have a gym pass to help me get some control over my depression. After 3 years I'm still not some swole alpha male, and I eat well because it gives me some more energy throughout my busy day of hustling 3 jobs.

 I have female friends whom I value significantly more than any potential sexual relationship I might have with them, which is probably why they enjoy hanging around with me. If I can be in a group of 2-3 people I'm very content, and can conversate normally. But put me in big crowds or with people I don't know, and I stutter. 

I'm kind, helpful, and nonjudgemental. More reasons people (woman or otherwise) enjoy my company. 

I do shower. I wear discounted H&M clothes because as a graduate student who's paid cash for all his classes, I like to dress moderately fitted for my body type while not spending more than necessary on clothing. It's not hard, it's like $5 a shirt. 

This is the life of a normal, everyday Chad. We're just people. And if you honestly have this sad characterization of people who work hard towards having a good mental and physical health, just as an excuse for you to act like an edgy 12 year old, my suggestion is read what I wrote above and apply it to your life.

"I've gotten to experience incel culture really close up. Like face pressed to the glass at the zoo close up. And I have to say it is the most pitiful and ridiculous reaction you can have to a change in society. Society has largely freed sexuality, with hookup culture becoming normalized, and social gatherings less organized and quickly planned due to electronic communication. For someone who's socially awkward and lacking self confidence it's the perfect opportunity to build yourself up. Hit the gym and have some hobbies and intellectual interests and no matter what face you were born with you'll be able to find someone in the numerous and easily discovered social settings you can find yourself. But instead they stay at home with their parents and cry that they have been given an unfair hand in life and that they'll never have sex. It's exactly that attitude that prevents them from meeting someone that fits with them and having a real human relationship that includes but isn't just sex. Some people will naturally have an easier time being attractive and finding a partner, but nearly everyone can do it. Like only people with severe, extremely severe disorders cannot. The only people they have to blame are themselves, and deep down they realize this, and this is why many of them resort to suicide. And here is where society has failed them. Instead of ""showing them the light"" that is self improvement and taking meaningful steps towards becoming the person you want to be, we ostracize them and let them flounder alone in their self pity and let their rage buildup until they kill themselves or others. Very similar to the school shooter type of person.",0,0,2018-08-06T18:00:58.000Z

"A few things:

Incels can be any gender, can come from any background and can be of a variety of different personalities.
There are a few crazy extremes but they are not the norm.

Dating is really, really exceptionally hard for some people. It is not society's fault. It is not the fault of any group of people. To be considered attractive you need to have the right kind of charisma, a certain kind of personality, be ambitious, have enough money to support a family, be someone who could be a decent parent, have a lot in common with whatever gender you're trying to attract, fit a set of mainstream set of social and moral norms as well as be able to easily demonstrate all of your strengths. In addition to all of this, you've got to be able to sell yourself, be socially adept and know all of the cues.

It is not impossible. There are plenty of people who don't fit the ideal standards who are in relationships.

The ""Incel"" community that the media talks about, are extremists who are at war with society. Most incels are not violent unstable terrorists. They just want to be in a loving relationship. It is not a case of being ""entitled"". Rather it is frustration over being unable to achieve the dream of starting a family and raising children, because they do not meet the requirements.",0,0,2018-08-06T17:23:34.000Z

"Resentment breeds resentment, if you want the people who are resentful of you to understand you, you must understand them. I like that the interviewer asked genuine questions and refrained from casting judgement on the guy. 

I think most of these guys were taught traditional values throughout their lives and get confused and frustrated when traditional methods of romance don't produce any results in the modern age. Maybe some of these guys grew up in religious families where people abstain sex until marriage, then they find out that the girls in their classes are losing their virginity at age 14. Maybe they got bullied or rejected (probably both) which lowered their self-esteem. Then on top of that their universities are pushing social justice propaganda down their throats. No wonder they feel alienated. 

The majority of them are stuck in a self-pity mentality and blame others for their own shortcomings, which is their main problem. It's easy to say ""just stop doing that"" but most of them are suffering from some form of mental setback.

Also most of the stuff they say about race or women is jokes. This isn't really so much an incel thing, this is common male sense of humor. Of course nowadays if you joke like this, some people react like you insulted their god. So they're relegated to the internet where there's no body-language or tone, and then its harder to determine whether or not someone was making a joke or actual statements. 
So now on top of being lonely, these guys are ostracized as racist or sexist.",0,2,2018-08-06T16:36:44.000Z

"I have the solution to this problem. But its not for lazy people.
You need:
To get out of your parents house. Doesn't mean you have to buy a new house, just rent a studio apartment. Its completely affordable on min wage.

Get a job. Any job according to your skills or qualifications.

To let your facial hair grow

To join a boxing gym. You dont have to win a medal or belt or something. Just learn some combinations. Hit the heavy bag.

To run every morning. Or any cardio you like. Especially if you're overweight.

To get a motorcycle. Doesn't have to be a liter bike or a 1100cc Harley, just get a Ninja 300 or a Yamaha FZ-07. Its much cheaper than a car and gets much better mileage.

"I know some of these guys. Not sure whether they consciously consider themselves part of this group, but they definitely fit the mold. They are primarily introverted, which I can relate to. Where we differ is that I grew up before the age of cell phones and personal computers, which I believe are exacerbating the problem. Despite being socially retarded, I dated as a young man, and eventually was married and had 3 kids. None of this ever came easily to me, and required effort. Relationships are difficult for me to begin, and even more difficult to maintain. It's even harder for kids like me today, and I think I understand why. First of all, they rely way to heavily on the internet, and get little or no face to face social interactions, so they tend to lack experience. Also, my experience would seem to indicate that, when they *do* attempt to engage in real, face to face social interactions in the interest of developing romantic relationships, their standards tend to be unrealistically high. A lot of females are lonely and frustrated for the same reason. I always hear complaints that ""the good guys are not interested in me,"" and shake my head. A lot of women refuse to ""settle"" for less than 8-10 on a 1-10 scale even though men might rate them closer to the middle of that same scale, and the men are often equally unrealistic.",4,0,2018-08-06T15:24:13.000Z

"Its much deeper than some people think. You get incel's that still manage to get laid,even get a girlfriend, and their resentment and self hate towards themselves and other people doesn't go away.

So many of them started declaring themselves like this as teens.TEENS.Very few relationships at teen age last,i personally see them as unimportant. They resent the world at an early age, isolated at a time where they could learn so much and eventually mature. But no, they then grow up only knowing hate and their own morphed view on the world. They even resent incels that realise they need to improve themselves for their lives to get better.

Alot of them feel they are too high in power for a prostitute or sex doll, and eventually high in power were women mean nothing to them as humans. Which is where alot of the abuse and violent ""jokes"" towards women come from.

It both scares me that such bitterness and hate towards people can exists, but it's also sad that few of them try to improve their lives,wallowing in a pit that some how something is going to magically happen and make their lives better. Most of the guys in that group chat looked fine and like normal humans, not some ugly troll that they make themselves out to be.

"Being in incel forums for quite a while is a hell of an experience. Plenty of them need therapy, some because they're mentally ill, others have low self esteem. The incel community and MGTOW have a very similar mentality, thinking that women are gold-diggers but more than often don't care about getting to know them. It's a very toxic kind of atmosphere, but the thing is, these people take so much pride on their beliefs that whenever they talk about it they feel a sense of confidence, as if they're the ones who see the truth in this society. They are willingly giving their lives away spending time on  forums, chatrooms and what else. Most of them if not all, have felt pressured to have sex just like their peers. I don't know any incel in real life, nor do I talk to them online, but as a teenager I can see how some of them get worried thay they'll never get a girlfriend, they haven't kissed a girl. They are not willing to change because to them, changing is as harmful as the expectations that [the society] has on them. To them, they're all normies; whenever someone says they'll be ""quitting"" the forums for some time and after several months come back to share their progress they think they've been brainwashed, they've given up their personality, that's why change frightens them. These people have based their illness as their personality, they make self-deprecating jokes all the time, if they stop doing it what is left of them? In some sense, they've become outsiders, what we can't argue is that it's on them to find the will to have a better life. It's kind of a complex issue here.",0,0,2018-08-06T14:55:37.000Z

"Accepting that an ""Incel"" is an ok term is instantly accepting multiple assumptions about sexuality. One is that, it intrinsically implies that women are the gatekeepers of sex who choose when and when not to withhold it from men. It implies that a preconceived idea about positive masculinity is the only way to have healthy relationships with women. The Incel movement and news stories like this are basically saying: ""If these men were just more confident and manly, then women would give them their sex which they are withholding and only giving to men who live up to this preconceived idea about masculinity that we are promoting"". This causes an objectification and stereotyping of women as sexual objects. I think the emotions and struggles these men are experiencing are a result of the alienation caused by the economical and social systems of their society. These systems are imposed upon these young men through media outlets and stories such as this. They are shown what positive masculinity is by corporations who want their money, and are made incredibly insecure when they feel they cant live up to these standards. The real problem is a lack of meaningful existence. The issue isnt that these men ""cant get laid"" (LOL), the issue is their deep isolation and alienation due to a lack of social systems and community involvement and interactions.

"It seems like a vicious cycle to me. If these guys actually got laid, they would realize that sex isn't a big deal, they wouldn't let it control them so much and they would actually be able to improve their lives. Until they get laid, they are stuck in a state of sabotaging themselves because they allow their sexual frustration to control their minds. It sucks and I can understand their frustration, but they honestly need to distance themselves from the echo chambers they find themselves in online. They are toxic and do absolutely nothing positive for these guys. The confirmation bias they get from each other only worsens their situation and fills their heads with nonsense rhetoric to justify the fact that they are just not making any effort to be appealing as people. As long as they interact with the world through the lense of 'being an incel', they will remain incels.

"Vice actually did a semi decent video for once. Too bad the comments are your usual predictable garbage. ""Oh here's an extreme example of a socially isolated incel, I know, I will ostracize him even more and consider all incels to be the same, to fix the issue!""

People need to completely remove the bias and look at the RECENT facts. Incels are new. 2 in 5 men will still be virgins by the age of 26 (polar opposite for women). They are a result of many problems from single mothers, hypergamy, sexual revolution and social/masculine bastardization resulting from tech advancement. Until the late 1600s ALL men had procreating rights in exchange for a stake in society. Imagine being told you can no longer have a family but still have to provide for the same people telling you this. 40% of men will not have children as of the 21st century (majority being involuntary). 80% of relationships/divorce are initiated by women. That alone means a small percent of men are having multiple children across several women. How is that fair? How does that produce a healthy society?

Men naturally (bio) value procreating high. We have an extremely strong sexdrive that is shunned in todays society, yet, encouraged. Being a virgin male today is hell. Society has an embellishing stigma to state virgins have failed as a human (whether you accept it or not). Its the go to insult for WOMEN (alone) to use as of 2011 (and I have only seen guys dishing it out). I urge people to look up scholarly sources on the topic before even considering an opinion. You would be shocked just how COMMON it is for millennial women to have 100+ sexual relationships. What we need is for the media to stop directing hate towards incels. They need help. They were given a shitty hand from the get-go and like with all people who suffer from mental illness, need help rather than prejudice and mockery.

I am a tru-cel myself. I run my own business and I have an active and healthy lifestyle including investing serious effort to have a relationship. There is nothing more morally suicidal than being rejected dozens of times and seeing the people who rejected you having loving relationships afterwards. This is something the MAJORITY of women will never have to experience as they are the natural attracters of our species.

We as a species have removed our thousand year old practice of monogamy for more freedom. But what people will never admit is that monogamy is what made us the strong species we are today. An alpha submitting one of his concubine to reward a beta for his impressive feat. By removing that, you are removing the very fabric of our stability. There will be consequences as a result.",3,1,2018-08-06T14:45:03.000Z

THERE IS NO CHAD.

As hard as it may be to believe, there are men out there who are great looking and successful but have the personality of a frog, like a witch got the spell backwards and made him good looking outside and hideous inside. Ego happens a lot in this category.  They may get sex, but they will never be loved.  Ever.  By the time they are in their fifties the fat lady sings and nobody wants anything to do with them.

There are also men who are frogs through and through.  They always have been frogs.   Before you say ""that is me,"" reflect: did you ever meet a guy growing up who was just nasty to everyone and surly and a grump?  Or never grew beyond age 15? Or who women thought smelled like an old sock?

Then there are those who hate themselves because their self esteem and worth is in the toilet.  YOU FALL IN THIS CATEGORY.  Go rewatch Beauty and the Beast. No enchanted castle, to a woman, is worth the animal looking guy who may snap her in half at any moment.  He is as bad as Gaston.  He probably doesn't bathe and has the social skills of a boy, not a man.

*He has to figure out how to change so he doesn't push her away and he has to learn how to not let his fear of dying alone consume him.  He has to learn to relate to her.  He has to make her want to see if there is more there.  

Leave your comfort zone.  Don't expect a Stacy. You'll miss Charlotte, Lisa, Emily, and all the others on the way who you cannot meet if you do not give them a chance.  Talk to a therapist.  Go on and find her. She ain't in the chat room.",0,1,2018-08-06T14:22:54.000Z

In 1997, she started a mailing list on the topic that used the abbreviation INVCEL, which was later shortened to ""incel"". During her college career and after, she realized she was queer, and became more comfortable with her identity. She later gave the site to a stranger."" (wikipedia info)

"Sympathy should not be wasted on any members of the ‘manosphere’- whether they’re incels, MGTOWs, or PUAs. After browsing these nutty forums, you will quickly learn that the average member is an immature, entitled sociopath who wants for women to be violently and legally oppressed and stripped of all rights. Not to mention the paranoia laced anti-semitism. Don’t give me that ‘they suffer from depression and anxiety’ crap. These struggles should make them more sympathetic to the plight of others. Most people who have or had these issues, myself included, don’t project extreme hatred towards half the population. That isn’t even close to being a rational or justified reaction.

He also seems to be speaking very normally to this reporter. The way their conversation flows shows that he can in fact talk to people. I  feel as though this might be easy for him because a) he is in his own room where he spends most of his time and thus feels safe,  b) he knows she has an interest in him ( not sexually, but simply because she is a journalist trying to capture a story and he is the story in this case) so theres a feeling of being desires in a way which might boost his confidence.

This was scary to watch due to the fact I myself am a Virgin at 18. I wouldn’t say it’s because of my appearance because have been told I’m attractive by many girls. And I was quite popular in highschool like even the hottest girls would come up to me and say hi every now and then. I’m not that socially awkward either I actually threw many parties and was really known to be a fun dude to hang with. But I feel less of a man because I’ve had girls play me and run me through the gutter. Most people say it’s because I’m a “Nice Guy” but I just don’t understand. I just keep to myself and keep busy by reading and taking my co-workers shifts and lie that I need the money when in reality I just rather not be home a lone because depression ain’t a joke.,0,0,2018-08-06T08:35:36.000Z
"Hmmm...there was definitely a point in my life when I was young, late teens, where I felt like I was ugly, and that no woman would want me even though I thought I was a good guy. I resented myself and to an extent women, but I then realized that it was the way I perceived myself that was the problem. Once I realized this I decided to see myself in a positive light and I forced myself to go out to bars and clubs to break out of the shell I had surrounded myself in. 

Low and behold I met the first girl I dated shortly after that, and things were fine after that.

"He's not alone, in a recent study by the Office for National Statistics, young people (between the ages of 16 and 24) were the most likely to report themselves as feeling lonely. https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/07/27/loneliness-is-not-just-a-problem-for-the-elderly

It's a huge stigma and an epidemic that needs to be addressed and attacked by our politicians ASAP. It's not just the elderly anymore who are vulnerable. Please make sure to help tackle this by talking to your local representatives, more voices about this issue need to be heard.

It's a vicious cycle, not getting outside accentuates the depression (to extreme levels the more days go by) and getting outside accentuates the anxiety (to extreme levels if he has to talk to someone or voluntarily does trying to break the cycle). It's even worse if the woman he talks to give him bad look or smth.
After a long time not having meaningful human conexions drives insane to the point only escape route is suicide for many. Having both depression and anxiety is the worse combo one could face in mental health.

His blaming of chads and women is obviously very immature even if true by any degree. He only blames this groups of people imo because he can't cope with the thought he's unable to break the cycle. Saying that only made his likelihood of getting help much much worse... And it is already hard to get proper help for this group of people. Breaking the cycle is really tough, impossible for most as evidenced by the suicides.

There's literally BILLIONS of women on this planet, even if chances are 0.0001% he'd still succeed, you just gotta be willing to face rejection (which is a unavoidable pain, unless you hit in the first try lol). Try to rewire your brain to not think rejection as pain but as reward for putting yourself out there!

One thing that helps greatly also imo is learning about proper health diet/exercise, it's the single biggest improvement to your mental health. Take vitamin D etc, most people are micronutrient defficient and are completely unaware. Be resilient and consistent.",1,0,2018-08-06T08:17:03.000Z

I'd say that the ""involuntary"" part in not because of women (or men, if such a thing as a gay incel exists), but more because of psychological blockages they've developed over time. 

In the case of the smoking one, he's young and physically able, why isn't he getting treatment? I assume he's living with very permissive parents who just leave him there doing his thing and supporting his vice... And if they don't approach women, where do they are getting info of how many men are women sleeping with in their early 20s?

"I'm an incel too, but I am nothing, NOTHING, like these poor guys . . .

5' 11""
Scandinavian
blonde hair
blue eyes
tan 
Athletic build
Have my own business as a handyman.
. . . yet I still find myself kissless, sexless, gf-less, at 26 years of age. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I don't drink alcohol, smoke weed, use social media in any form, or try to impress girls/people with my possessions.

Not so much the later, but for sure the first two. Abstaning from social media (Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram etc) and alcohol has turned me into a social outcast. Once they find out about my lifestyle girls anywhere near my my age range and even guys for that matter, want nothing to do with me. 

My situation is only exacerbated by my apparently outrageous standards.

Don't . . . 
be obese
smoke
drink like a fish
have half your body covered in tattoos
Have ridiculous piercings (eyebrow, cheek, nose, lip, nips, etc) ears only please.

"Tips to get a lady:
*a long list of about 10+ tips*

(1.) Become financially stable or at least self sufficient. Either go to some secondary education, college etc or at least find a decent job. That just makes you feel like less of a burden on society and less like things are owned to you that you have not earned. Overall that's a character builder. 

(2.) Join some local organizations where you can give back to your community and learn some humility along the way by noticing there are ppl with issues beyond what you struggle with. Maybe a food pantry/local soup kitchen etc. 

(3.) Learn to realize when you should be empathetic to others. Look up socialization ques so you can know if you are off putting to women when approaching them. 

(4.) Become more self aware of your feelings and negative things you are telling yourself. If necessary use cognitive behavioral therapy on yourself by editing negative & prejudice thoughts you have that are reinforcing the stigma you feel from being an incel. 

(5.) Be healthy. Workout. Eat well. Start a skin care routine, even its its a cleanser for your skin type (oily, dry, combination or normal for example)and a good moisterizer. You will feel physically and mentally better. its a great start to begin overal happiness and a very admirable trait to mention while trying to date. Dont spam it though . Its important to have more to your personality then just looking good. 

(6.) Keep yourself up. Do things stylewise that are just for you and really showcase your personality. Grow facial hair. Get a cool hair style that fits your persona but doesnt look dirty or unkempt. 

(7.) You dont have to spend tons of cash/have name brand clothes But at least try to have well fitting clothes that compliment you body shape. This aids in your overall attractiveness by being aesthetically pleasing. 

(8.) Learn what interests you have whether it be video games, art, music traveling, seeing live stand up comedy or being a movie fanatic. Use this hobby to join online communities that share similar interests with you. This will hell you gain friends and can become a talking point when chatting with girls online. 

(9.) Try making friends with women. This could also give you insight on why women arent choosing you as mates. 

(10.) Remember Not every contact with a girl has to be sex related. My husband and i consider each other best friends and sexual intimacy is a great bonus.  

(11.)  Most importantly learn to love yourself. And not in the ""i dont see anything wrong with me wtf is wrong with these hoes today"" kinda way but in the ""i am perfectly imperfect and i am okay with that. There maybe women who aren't interested in me but that doesn't decrease my value as a human being""  

(12.) Lastly when you do get with a woman sexually PLEASE learn as much as you can about our bodies and dont come into the bedroom thinking she needs to be begging you to bang her and squirting at the mire thought of you being inside of her. Taking thinks slow, making it an intimate moment for both of you and tons of communication, fourplay, lube, good digital, oral and thoughtful stroking skills are essential to a great experience for both parties. And increase the likelihood of her coming back for more.  
*** I would suggests informative porn from an actual sex therapist and switching to homemade amature porn of devoted couples as well. This is done to remind you that porn is a crafted fantasy and everything is hand picked to seem perfect and ideal Yet it is not real life AT ALL. Ideally you'd be watching the kind with participants that look like you so you can really visualize yourself properly, that way you can get a more realistic idea of how sex between lovers should go.  

Honestly hopes this helps in contrast just calling you names and laughing at your misfortune. 

P.S. plz give me feed back on if you agree with the points I made. Thanks Friends",197,62,2018-08-06T05:59:53.000Z

"Most incels are dumbasses. However, i think they're correct in many ways. It's very clearly true there's a massive discrepancy between the advantage women/chads have in the dating market relative to average men and below average. 
It's not fair how easy all women except the very ugly ones have it, or how easy the cream of the crop men have it either. Women's standards these days are too fucking high, i blame texting and social media mostly. Because now average women have easier immediate access to many types of men, so they're bombarded with many options, and get some hyper inflate egos as a result because of the positive feed back they'll get from high status men. 
Even if that positive feed back merely means one off sex. Women are extremely selective these days. 
I'm a pretty solid dude, and im on a 50 rejection streak. It's actually normal. What incels don't realize , they have to play a numbers game or set up their lifestyle properly in order to get new leads. It's just state of shitty affairs for men currently.
BUT, life is unfair, and that's honestly okay. More of a challenge to overcome is all.",0,2,2018-08-06T05:57:34.000Z

"This is the aftermath of porn culture. These men have never identified or tried to relate to any real women beyond sexual means. Sorry to burst their bubbles, but women aren't obsessed with your dicks, large or small. In fact, the harsher truth is that most men, their bodies and their social status are irrelevant to women. Most women are living their OWN lives, which includes school, work and taking care of their children and families, not drooling over men and their ""magnificent"" dicks. If they had talked to even 3 women, they would know that. Overwhelmingly, women are not banging 100's of men - again, stop 'learning' about women through porn, which is manufactured by/for men. It's not real. Women also like men who are sensitive, smart and creative. Again, the phallic and macho obsession/worship they depict shows how entirely out of touch they are with women and what they want and what sexually arouses women. I also have the same mental illnesses that the guy in the clip has, and I've dated ALOT. If he spent his time talking to females with similar issues, perhaps he would find the world a lot less depressing. I've also dated someone that had my similar issues in the past, and having a person to relate to and develop a romantic relationship with is also very cathartic. He could have that, but he's drowning himself in depression and negativity. They live off of shocking each other to feel something, it's not a sustainable or helpful way to live. Instead of relating to people in a positive way, he's relating with people who shit themselves on camera...no wonder you're fucking depressed, dude. Get out of that chatroom and never look back. If you allow yourself to wallow in that frame of mind for too long, you'll lose any chance or hope of ever having a woman consider you.",1,3,2018-08-06T05:55:41.000Z

If you need money you apply for jobs and won't get every job you applied for but if you keep trying you will land a job.  If you seek friendships, not everyone will be your friend, you have to weed through the bad people to find good friends.  If you want a partner, you have to keep trying and eventually something will click.  These guys seem to think they are entitled to anything and everything in life.  Life gets difficult?  They stay home on their computers with other incels while the rest of us keep trying to catch that fish, job, friend or partner.  I mean the reason they can't find a partner is because nature is all about survival and these guys have given up on survival so women sense that and intuitively understand these guys won't help their tribes (family) survival under any and every circumstance.  That's why women won't be with these guys, that's really what the issue is here.",0,0,2018-08-06T05:18:32.000Z

And for god's sake... look within yourself, if you are a male... I am sure you can bring out some masculine traits.

"I think **some** incels harbor resentment towards women because resentment is born unto tyranny. Women represent a sort of tyranny in the reproductive space in that they have total control and men have none, making many men feel like trying to find a mate is chaotic and even more chaotic is the rejection. They fear the rejection because when that rejection occurs, they experience this worst fear that can spiral into this negative feedback loop (and many of us do this in smaller ways about other more menial failures in life) that tends to be self-fulfilling. 

For those wondering what I'm talking about with women having reproductive control, human women are selective breeders who choose mates unlike our chimp and other primate relatives; it's one of the ways we have evolved so fast as a species.

Another note on incels: !!!A LOT OF MEN ARE INCELS!!! In most populations, just about every woman will have one child while only half of men will have a child, and of that half of men that does have a child, they will actually have 2 while the other 50% of the male population will have 0. While this doesn't necessarily make all of these men virgins, it does make them technical outcasts in the sexual arena.

"Did people who think like this exist 20, 50, 100 years ago? I really wonder about that.

I don't think it's changing gender dynamics that have made them so miserable. I think it's mostly a culture that has made it much harder to develop basic social skills growing up. I feel like the friendships we form now are much fewer, more ephemeral, and less deep than the ones we did before the internet and a culture of constant relocation and reduced face-to-face interaction. Because social interaction is difficult, it's a skill we have to develop, we will tend to let that skill atrophy if we can get through life without it. People who let this go far enough end up like this. Extremely isolated and miserable. I mean it's something I struggle with myself, and I have a much healthier social life (and certainly sex life) than any of these guys.

Certainly, having one or more of those characteristics helps but personalty/social behavior is the most important. Most Incel's, like the guy in this video, have difficulty interacting people in the real world. You can say Incel's have a low EQ (Emotional Quotient). Forming a bond with women requires social interaction and having her discover interests about you. You can easily tell Incel's problem. They want sex, but they don't to work for it, in the sense of doing social interaction. I have a girlfriend, and had a few in my life, I'm 37 now, but there were times I went years without a partner, and I felt very lonely.

"So when he talks about 22, 23 year olds sleeping with 100+ men, and also being let down & hurt by this, I think that this was very key. It isn't entirely accurate, but there are some elements of truth. Four of his friends have killed themselves. There are a lot of badly adjusted young people suffering at the moment. Once upon a time sex was something that was supposed to happen within a strong, loving and committed relationship. It was a given, that before you would be having sex with someone, you would have spent a lot of time getting to know that person, and that you were going to put a lot of effort into building a happy union with that person. It didn't always happen like that, but it was put out there that it was expected to happen that way. Now our society is practicing a broken system, with an aimless set of principles. Sex has been downgraded as a fun act done to gain momentary pleassure and validation. It rarely works out like that, but as a society we ignore this inconsistency, and the associated problems, and push sex without responsibility. What makes me most attracted to my husband is when I feel close to him, because he shows me that he cares. When he goes with me to a Bhuddist meeting, or has lunch with my grandmother, these things are a huge turn-on. I'm not that unlike most women, but for some reason men are not being given this message.",88,21,2018-08-06T00:22:06.000Z

"With or without sex, either way, a huge and growing number of young people spend an insane amount of time indoors, completely isolated from any face to face contact with other humans. I don’t think they realize how devastating of an impact that has on their mental health and overall well-being. 

There’s a sort of “perfect storm” brewing right now of new technology taking over our lives and exponentially increasing the temptation to be alone and indoors, while at the same time industrial jobs are disappearing and college is getting more and more expensive. On top of this, way fewer people are born into tight-knit communities then was once the case. People are becoming much more isolated. Unfortunately I predict that this combination will have devastating effects in the decades to come. Society’s collective mental heath is beginning to crumble.",0,2,2018-08-05T23:09:12.000Z

which, hey, good on him for that!!

for the record i obviously feel the same way about women who do this do their parents...just shameful...and also women and men who marry someone for the money, and then sit on their ass all day and contribute nothing

But they are the marginalized community. They can't get girlfriends, they can't start a family, they can't integrate into society, and they've mostly tried. They're demoralized, depressed, and people are just yelling at them for exactly why they already hate themselves. And it's worse with so many comedians and celebrities and activist women flaunting around how loose they are, they're sexuality, and how easy they are. But they still can't date a women, or even just have sex with them if that's ""casual"" now. Simultaneously, they are constantly criticizing and critiquing male sexuality, perhaps rightly so in most cases. These men already hate themselves and are bad with women, and you are further discouraging them, and complain about them.

It's not so surprising that they hate themselves and the world.

"Hi VICE NEWS, and thanks for sharing this video with us. One thing that I am confused about, is why there is no coverage on who created these Incels. Perhaps part of this is some aspect of society, but these boys/men have parents. They have mothers and fathers. I wonder, what sort of challenges existed throughout the lives of these males in the home that resulted in being prone to label themselves as Incels later in life? I look to the parents because, racism is usually caused by racists parents spreading that belief to their children. Or, being a Christian. Or Suppressing your sexuality. Or being a kind honest person. All of these are largely because of parenting, which is why parents exist, to guide children into adulthood. And so I wonder, are largely Incels a product of bad parenting? Perhaps, bad single mothers?

Everyone from supposed Christian ministries that are really narcissist control centers, to feminists, that are really just female narcissists, are out trying to make it to where young men can’t find a wife because they know how effective married couples are at changing the world for the better, and narcissists love spreading misery. Then when these guys can’t get any, they’re labeled incels and told that’s one more thing wrong with them. Let’s call it what it is: “madecels!” Everyone from the church to feminists, to the booze companies is out to make sure that if you’re not drunk at the bar or getting high at a party, you’re not getting any, ever. That’s how our evil lil nation operates. These guys chose the forbidden path of not be drunks and junkies, so none for them, America wants good little drunk, junkie consumers, and feminists narcissists are happy to reinforce that, like they’re doing here. Guys I’ll give you some real advice: get foreign wives. Except for a miracle, American women are garbage. That’s what they’ve been propagandize from early on to be, and there are exceptions, but not many. Most girls you find in church, narcissists, feminists, narcissists, narcissists all over the university system and society. See a pattern here? The 1 %  like little narcissist consumers and they’ve worked to make all citizens particularly women, just that in one form or another. The 1% realized wives could be commodified and used to disenfranchise average people. That’s why the prettiest young women are stripping at the bar, so they can get a college education, so they can work like a slave for an employer, and they can blame their misery on a vague notion of everyman, called the “ patriarchy,” cause the 1% don’t want the blame because,  cause they’re the ones cheating the women and society.",7,2,2018-08-05T22:04:05.000Z

"Mental Health is one of lives true demons. All i read in the comment section is a lot of shaming and disrespect, exactly the same thing these Incels are complaining about. Do i believe that they are crazy for thinking Sex will solve all of their problems...yes but they have mental issues. Two/three of his friends killed themselves. This is so sad. 
Do i believe we live in a “Chad” rewarding society like love island...yes. 
But from that a “MGTOW”, “INCEL” culture is created. 
These young men fail to understand that the world does not owe them anything. I believe it is a messed up sense of entitlement and a spoilt childhood, a childhood so spoilt that they are still unemployed and on the internet everyday. 
 Sex does not fix this issue, but with it being so easily available nowadays, its understandable why they may feel left out of this “thing”.
I believe we are responsible for this world we live in now. A bunch of conspiracy theory driven wack jobs, Trump supporters thinking a washed up millionaire is the second coming. Middle america on hard drugs, and all of these kids on lean. Growing up, if you smoked a cigarette you were a badass. If you don’t pop xanex, sip lean and spark a joint... you are considered lame today.

Most women seek long term relationships so a lot of them will be with one person on average from as low as 3 months to a year and 6 months.

"As someone who is on the autism spectrum.. I've been dealing with chronic depression for 13 years because of my lack of communication skills and getting bullied. My interests and obsessions made me never go outside. My entire school life was just me getting made fun of. For the last 9 years of my education I had 0 friends because I was not able to talk proficiently enough because of my disability. I took up coding, hacking, modding, and social engineering as a way to cope. It made me feel better about myself. Even though I was too smart for my own good.. people thought I was an idiot. As if social skills determine someone's intelligence or intellectualism. I became addicted like these guys. Except instead of hosting chat rooms I actually did cool shit. But allot of this isn't a stretch. My entire life i was bullied, put down, and was lonely. Nobody wanted to talk to me because I knew about so much stuff nobody cared or cares about. They wanted to talk about sex and girls.. I wanted to talk about how we could implement technology into infrustructure to create a less primitive form of constructing and create better forms of transportation (just an example). So i never fit in. My anxiety was so bad it led me to lock myself in the bathroom stalls for 2 hours almost daily where I would draw and write stories while feeling down and left out. I strived to be *normal* so much it made me suicidal. I just wanted to trade. Take my intelligence, take my artistic talents, Take my creativity, make me an ingorant motherfucker.. Anything for social skills I would have done it. The pressure from society to have sex and date women made me feel literally worthless because I lacked all forms of social skills to do that.  I've been in out of psychiatric wards because of it. I self injured because i didn't know why I couldn't be like everyone else. You can't turn on the radio, watch a movie, or a TV show.. You can't even sit down and relax without hearing the topic of sex or dating. That can put enormous pressure on people like me who struggled or struggle with making connections. Were put in a major predisposition. Luckily I was gifted with good looks to make up for my social skills. I had to teach myself over the course of a 13 year period how to interact semi decently. I'm now older and I can actually talk pretty well. I've gotten laid, and also was with a woman for a few months lol. It wasn't even all that special honestly. I still struggle to not get upset at the topic of sex or dating but sometimes it still affects me. Honestly.. It would be more effective to legalize and regulate prostitution and sex work. Honestly that was just the tip of the iceberg on my part. I don't want to write a book about autism and socializing failures. But I just hope maybe the small things i mentioned can make someone understand that this can be a serious issue. I've felt what this feels like and it's horrible. People should not have to feel left out and worthless because they lack a few traits everyone else has. Appreciate yourself, and you'll make it brahs.",0,0,2018-08-05T20:45:56.000Z

"Also a great idea to get girls: stop smoking. I never got that until i quit smoking. Non-smokers mostly can't stand a smoker's breath let alone kiss him or her. So by stopping smoking you probably triple your ""hunting grounds"", like 70% of women throughout most ages are non-smokers. To find a girl that shares your interests, gets your jokes and stories and is into you is like three times harder when she also needs to be a smoker to be numbed enough to be able to smell your burning tyre breath or kiss a cold ashtray.

"This dude actually seems relatively intelligent and isn't even significantly unattractive. Shows how harmful insecurity can be. I have a problem with insecurity which may be at least part of the reason I've become an incel. Up until about my mid twenties I was much more outgoing and was actually popular with females. In that time period I had more 8/10+ girlfriends than I can even count anymore and have sleep with at least 20 attractive women. Since then I have been in a downward spiral into inceldom. I believe it is because I did too many drugs. For a couple years in my early to mid 20s I was using ecstacy almost every weekend and I believe it destroyed my personality and triggered depression and social anxiety. Now, I'm very reclusive and lonely. 

I do feel grateful that at least I was fortunate enough to have had a wonderful social/sex in my prime and I will die knowing those pleasures. Many incels don't have this. I have many wonderful memories. Regardless, it is still very painful to be as lonely as I am now.",1,0,2018-08-05T19:41:36.000Z

"He is not an ""incel,""  he is a person with diagnosed social and mental health issues and he is associating with people who promote his anxieties and sense of loneliness. It's similar to being an alcoholic and then joining a drinking club: you are around people who feel like you, but you are promoting your own slow demise. The group he associates with is creating social division with an ""us versus them (Chad)"" paradigm that only digs a deeper hole for him. He needs a bigger social group and not a smaller one. For him to get better, he would need to become the ""them"" - a Chad who is an enemy to his social circle - and lose the only fragile, diminishing (suicides) support he has. Getting well is hard work and he is accepting temporary, fleeting solace instead of developing a positive support system.

But shes a woman.  Arguably a successful one at that.  Probably has had plenty sexual interest during her life because she's quirky and intelligent.  Probably has a long term boyfriend now who is a Chad too.

Can't be bothered to look any of this up but I'd put money on everything I've said above being correct.  It's the same story with girls like this AGAIN and AGAIN.  Seem it my whole life.  Ugly but quirky/smart women oddly getting hot dudes and cultivating the adoration whilst fostering the  resentment of men their own physical league.

"This is so hard for me to take seriously, I get that there are people with mental handicaps and social disorders that make meeting people near impossible but the truth is that most women prefer MEN. I don’t mean the “Chad” as they refer to him, true there will be immature women that are superficial and want nothing but money and looks or one of the two in a partner, but that is also not a real WOMAN, that is someone you as a man will not find a fulfilling relationship with. I don’t agree with most of the third wave feminist nonsense going on right now, but most women want to feel protected and safe with a man, and their are more ways a woman can be provided for than just monetary and superficial items. I can almost guarantee this guy could find a steady girlfriend and he even actually has looks on his side if he would learn how to dress and take some initiative to correct his bad habits that women would find unattractive, any of these guys would need to put forth just a tad bit of effort, and even if they are “awkward” as vice puts it there are plenty of “awkward” women for them to share love with.",6,7,2018-08-05T14:53:12.000Z

"Former incel here who had cosmetic surgery -   EVERY single 'incel' I saw in this video was CONSIDERABLY better looking than me.   Many of them are better looking than me EVEN AFTER 12k spent on a chin augmentation , nose job and jawline implants.

I still maintain that most Incels are simply facially below-average and low-T guys who are ignored by ugly girls their own league because the girls are deluded by apps like Tinder etc (and general hypergamy, juggernaut law etc) into thinking that they are more attractive than they really are.... But when I see an Incel documentary featuring physically adequate / normal faced dudes, I have no sympathy for them.

Guys, grow a fucking personality - you have adaqute genetics so you have no excuse.  I'd trade places with any of your looks in a second.

Finally I do not believe this video paints an accurate picture of Incels as a whole.  Think about it.  Incels are men of low sexual marketplace value - I.e ocxams razor would say most would be considered ugly and low in masculine appearance traits.  But the guys in this video seem perfectly normal looking. Photogenic even.  

Id argue that only good-looking but mentally ill / extremely socially deficient Incels would ever show their faces on camera.  ""True"" Incels would be too self conscious.   This documentary feeds the normie stereotype that Incels are to blame for their own situation as its only their personalities that are deficient.",4,5,2018-08-05T13:27:07.000Z

"I'm surprised this wasn't a train-wreck of an interview.
Here's some insights:
You shouldn't mock incels for being creepy or weird or virgins. It only reinforces their perception of reality wherein they feel ostracized. Their mind is stuck in this skewed world and when someone validates it, it only drives them further from reality. Virginity/sexual life is such a dumb thing. It's so heavily reinforced by society, especially masculine society, that those who fail to lose their virginity early on will suffer massively from it mentally. If society as a whole stopped giving a shit about when someone gets laid for the first time, it would greatly help a lot of people's self-esteem. I had a lot of anxiety personally about losing my virginity, until I did. And after that I didn't feel any more accomplished in any way. It was fucking dumb and hardly even enjoyable. It only gave me the courage to talk to women more.

Most of them also suffer from depression. Depression is like quicksand and an addiction in some ways. It's so fucking hard to take the steps necessary to escape, that you fall further down if you try and fail. Again. Instead of validating their delusional world of Chads and Staceys, we should try to help them. Don't brand incels as hate.

Lastly, to all the incels reading: It's 90% personality and 10% looks. You only get chicks based on looks effortlessly if you are top 10% in looks. You have to be 8.5/10 minimum to do that. I'm currently in the military and there's one guy in my room who is far less attractive than the interviewee. If the incel in this interview is 5.5-6/10, then my roomie in the army is a 4/10. My roomie had fucked 19 different women by the time he was 19. It's only because he's a genuinely interesting guy with cool hobbies such as hunting, and he's vulgar and inconsiderate. But you know what? it hasn't made him feel any more accomplished in life. no. On the contrary, it has made him feel shit to realize that he's incompatible for a long-term relationship.",0,0,2018-08-05T09:34:04.000Z

"This is a result of the crisis of masculinity. And the left including vice would vilify all of the things that would help these young men. They don't have a purpose or fulfillment. If they joined the Army, moved to a ranch, or put themselves in some other drastic situation that they couldn't just walk from, they would find that all life is struggle, there's pain and rejection, and no one has a perfect life. Then they'd learn to shoulder that pain and walk uphill with it, and that fulfillment comes from taking other people up that hill with you, sacrificing for others. 

We have a great method of teaching that philosophy through symbols and stories, there's a book about it and a guy who did shoulder his pain and everyone else's pain and marched up hill. But the left vilifies that system. That system is called Christianity. It's not about dudes in clouds and angels, it's about pain and suffering, and being a man.",0,0,2018-08-05T08:54:34.000Z

My reason is that we die. It is painful to live through life and why should I give this suffering to my child. Moreover, the reason is that more humans destroy the world, creates more war, and suffering. As an Incel, I also believe that Desire is Suffering and therefore all existence is suffering, hence the only way to achieve peace is non-existence. Hence, I'm an incel, buddhist, and yes I blame women for my turn because women bring problems to the world, from unemployment to war, since women desire men in the workforce so they choose only possible males and also are responsible for war because they create the children who will be soldiers.",2,8,2018-08-05T07:10:08.000Z

"These guys just the to calm their testosterones, 
Ill list some solutions for their problems.

1. They can have sex with prostitute's, hookers if they have $, desperate

2. They need to be more social, try to approach different kinds of women. You cant, different kinds of burgers

3. Hunt on different places not just 1 city or town, you cant get an apple on a banana tree.

4. Try building a relationship with NOT just 1 women, lets say about 100 or so, then youl have a higher chance. Spray and pray

5. Lower your standard's. Low risk= low to high rewards.

6. Some women wants to secure their future and settle down, you know what that means? They want to settle down with men who can provide them home you you both can live happily ever after.

7. According to my observation, some women form my country(Philippines) are so desperate to live abroad, you can save up some $'s and try your luck here, avoid scammers tho. And ine thing, you may have to spend money for their parents to so good luck, not recommend.

8. If you're a teenager, observe whats new or whats trending on your place(town,city) like the way people wear, try to outdo them.

9. If your face is 5 outta 10 bellow, try to make your body 8 out of 10 or above.

10. Be confident, like your easy to talk to, approachable, be mature.

11. You need to atleast consider that both partie have a Win win situation, 

404. Falling inlove too much is not recommend, you need to save up for your self, if you only want sex then so be it. Unleash that pent up testosterone bru!

Note: some of these tips may require you alot of time until you get your reward. Goodluck",0,0,2018-08-05T05:45:15.000Z

Be a warrior against this empire of nothing, not a simp that caves in and becomes demoralized by it. It’s easy to just give in and be guilted by these scumbag strangers telling you how terrible you are. Let that fuel you, become something greater. God damn these kids need a push. When they learn how to bond with other masculine men they’ll learn how to bond closely with women. If 80% of women go for the top 20% of men then find out what those top 20% of men possess besides good looks. They can attain a greater sense of purpose when they seek to understand the dynamics of life. You can’t understand the feminine if you don’t have a grasp on your own masculinity, or lack thereof.",0,0,2018-08-05T05:22:21.000Z

"The younger generations really do have problems coping with rejection. Is it a product of social media? Has social media created a generation of people that are socially awkward? Unable to converse with people, does that make it society’s fault?  I can’t understand this as a person who grew up without the internet, loving to be outside and talking to new people from all over.  I feel for these guys. It’s just not something I can wrap my head around. I had a really tough time with girls growing up. I was socially awkward. I didn’t actually have sex till much later in life.  Yes I was frustrated, but I never once ever felt violent. That I wanted to kill those who rejected me. It actually motivated me to concentrate on my own personal goals. Now I’m married to a woman that I love. And have children I think the world of. I chalk it up to growing up in a much different time.  Are kids these days too sensitive?

I think rodgers was pathetic. He Barely even tried before he went shooting. He expected to just park his car in crowded places and for girls to walk up to him and start flirting with him because he was ""the supreme gentleman.""

I don't know if you know this but we socially condition women for instance to be chased instead of doing the chasing. They are pressured by society not to ask men out but to wait for men to ask THEM out so even if they have a crush on a boy you'd barely know it because they are socially conditioned to be pursued rather than be the pursuer in relationships.

It's really easy to fall into this kind of thing when you're agoraphobic and it seems like mainstream society hates you and everything you stand for. Usually the extreme things they say are purposefully over the top, they're meant to ostracize the people/society that incels feel are being just as over the top and extreme when it comes to ostracizing them (the incels). 

Most incels are young millennial men, who honestly have it so fucking terrible in life, it's not just them whining, it's the truth. If you're a young millennial man who doesn't come from a rich and generous family and isn't capable of adulting at 200%, your life probably sucks ass. It's kind of easy to hate women when women hate you, in addition to these women acting like they are the ones who are so discriminated against, when in fact young millennial women have it so much easier than our male counterparts - many young millennial women act like it's the other way around, which is rightfully infuriating.

"Just this, treat woman as you don't need them and be mysterious. If she feels like she isn't worth anything for you she will do whatever it takes to get you, you have to play the game they play to be as bad as the other guys who have sex with them all. If you really just are crazy and want sex. I for example, am a normal guy and just lived my life without being like everyone else and all the gf's I had just appeared out of nowhere, it isn't something that you will have in your hands if you want it to work. Having sex is trowing your life away, finding the woman for you is the right thing.
And all about that woman doing the interview, yup, just talk to every single woman on this planet in a modern society that is anonymous even for you and you will know how much sex with different people they have, even girls. Just because you don't and your friends tell you that doesn't mean that it is the truth since girls lie more than they can want to lie about, females are manipulative beings.",0,0,2018-08-04T21:49:41.000Z

"It's easy to find someone who fits the anti ""chad"" description who has successfully found a partnership of mutual love with the opposite sex, where the incel rationale completely breaks down.  Delusion is 'man' against 'himself'.  And all evil perpetrated within humankind is to some degree a function of self-hating induced delusion.  That said, a self destructive culture will produce self destructive behavior; but even the latest fad, trend, or cultural norm began with a personal choice to create it or go along with it.  
    If both the rich and the poor, will one day cease to share in the experience of life, why would anyone spend any given moment contributing to the harm they acknowledge has been done to them?

"The “safety in numbers” afforded incels who prefer each other as company as opposed to dealing with the rest of the world only amplifies the problem by normalizing the situation. It is literally easier to believe in the great Chad conspiracy than to admit the typically long list of psychological challenges that eventually are disclosed by many self described incels.

Body dysmorphia goes hand in hand with the obsessive attention paid to the attractiveness of those they seek. “Unattainable” attractive women reject their interest not because of incompatibility, social awkwardness, or the sense the guy asking has more baggage than American Airlines. To the incel, it must only be about his looks. With chat rooms filled with like-minded social outcasts, confirmation bias fills in all the blanks. Diagnosis: confirmed.

Social media allows for a lot of healthy and unhealthy “support” among fellow travelers. But whether we’re talking about vaccination-nevers, conspiracy theorists, or incels, groupthink traps people into hopeless resignation.

As others have reflected, the guy interviewed isn’t unattractive at all. He’d be a candidate for one of those makeover shows and would be seen by other incels as a Chad if he took better care of himself. Smoking, a lack of exposure to light, and his attitude conspire against him. He was diagnosed by someone, so my next question is, what therapy is he getting now? I don’t sense any goals to overcome his challenges. His family has apparently enabled acceptance and paralysis in the status quo. We are stronger than we realize, but that isn’t usually revealed until we are challenged.

For those without a pedigree of social/emotional disorders, incel doom is real until some girl says yes. I think many incels get their start not learning how to broaden their social skills and emotional depth earlier in life. In many cases, they stuck with their best male friends in school, either watching their social network dwindle as guys got girlfriends and deprioritzed their guy friends to the point of resentment, or ended up jealous or frustrated they could not achieve the same. Unless you have an underlying, undiagnosed social disorder, incels often don’t do the work required to be more in touch with interpreting the feelings of others, often lack empathy, confidence, and an ability to read verbal/non-verbal cues correctly. In other cases, excessive shyness forces others to pull conversation from you, which is usually interpreted as your lack of interest. 

All of these things can be mitigated or at least understood given time and effort, but there is a disincentive. Many incels excommunicate those who do achieve a new relationship with a girl as lost causes. Some would prefer incels seek gay partners to achieve release and stay true to the cause. At least they “understand” how gay sex can be used as a tool. For related MGTOWs who swear off women, a girlfriend can equal betrayal. That threat of loss of the social connections.they built over what could be several years can be too much.",4,1,2018-08-04T14:31:55.000Z
"The 80\20 rule is real...where the top 80% of whores pursue the top 20% of men (and when I say ""top"" 20% of guys...that refers to their looks, money & or status.....NOT their character....women couldn't care less about that). That leaves the next 80% of men to compete over the bottom 20% of the leftover dating pool....after Chad has had first pick.

I'm a black guy (a curse from God...if one exists)...so it's 10x worse for me. I envy white male Chads. They don't have to do anything special either. All this crap about doing so much work to get the equivalent of a PhD in PUA....walk like this, take pictures like this, talk like this, stand like this, when to kiss....what cologne to wear...all this bullshit from a 600 page manual.

The actual Kens & Chads rely on their looks, money & status to get what they want. The typical American scum isn't sophisticated enough to care about what kind of character a guy has. Why do you think women always hook up with the most violent men? Why do you think they always end up in relationships with rapists and domestic abusers?

"Women are attracted to men of high social status. A limited number of men can have high social status by very definition. If a society develops a promiscuity culture (rather than a monogamy culture) -- which ours is starting to do -- a small percentage of men are going to have sex with the majority of women. This will leave a significant percentage of men with little to no sexual contact with women. It is the same in societies which allow men to marry multiple women. It's true that certain men would not find partners in any possible society because they are too physically unattractive or too weird, but to ignore the larger social context is disingenuous. Also, it obviously does Incels no good to fixate on this fact and enter a state of nihilistic despair.",1,3,2018-08-04T09:00:32.000Z

"Like everything, there's more than one reason. For sure, men have to look their best i.e. get in shape, work hard, be your own man and take control of your life, so being a victim while simultaneously having no agency to better yourself is not good enough.

BUT, don't think for one goddamn second that hypergamy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy) doesn't exist in the west now more than ever likely due to the sheer number of people available, higher economic inequality, the internet, social media, porn, steroids (for gym buffs) etc etc etc. So now we have a society where people's views of who is attractive is warped, and so there is likely to be more and more people (both men and women) who are now deemed less and less attractive. Long story short, incels will likely grow over time (both male and female).

With that being said, females currently are able to demand the sex they want from males (because men supply it more frequently i.e. men chase and women choose), so there's more male supply than female demand meaning offered male sex is deemed as cheaper (i.e. less valuable). Because of hypergamy, more and more men (who offer the sex) can't get ready access as the women who demand the sex only want it from higher quality males (as there is now a ""feast"" situation for women as opposed to ""famine""). Therefore there will likely be more incel men than women.

To incel men, I say this. It's truly terrible what's going out there, but don't let it make you bitter. Focus on your own interests outside of women. Get in shape to boost your confidence, find something you're passionate about, and gain mastery over it. Forge your own path. Go your own way.

Incels are people with psychological issues and are using lack of sex as the scapegoat.

There are sex dolls, fleshlights, Prosititution is legal in nevada, you can plan a trip with your buddies or just yourself and go have a fun time at one of the brothels there, just like how normal blue collar people have been doing since the 70s.

Theres plently of fugly women to go after, i mean if your an incel, ""a lesser man"", drop the man part, declare yourself a creature.

If we are God's unwanted children so be it.

Or!

"These guys are overthinking everything. They have unfortunately brainwashed themselves using a euphamistic labelling system created by a warped minority of individuals in order to mentally justify their lack of relationship experience. It's almost as if they have been radicalised online to believe they are innate failures in terms of sex / romance, when in actual fact, it is just a mixture or bad luck and childish / immature personality traits (which can of course change with a different outlook, therapy and new experiences).

What they need to do is reject the 'lack of relationship' as some kind of ""innate failure"", and instead view it as a fact of life that affects many, but can be overcome if they choose to reject such black-and-white labelling, and lower their expectations.

I think a large reason for their lack of relationship experience is probably because they have very twisted / warped ideas about how they work, how they occur, and how easy / difficult they are to find / start.

My advice to them: stop labelling yourself, remove yourself from harmful online communities, seek out greater life experience in terms of work, hobbiea and volunteering. Seek out a therapist so that you can have an external / secondary opinion on your personality and mental state. Lower expectations and stop living life with ""having a relationship"" as some kind of ultimate goal or acheivement.

In other words, stop trying to control every facet of life - go with the flow, be generous to others, analyse your own actions and see how you can improve the lives of other human beings, and stop living with the expectation that the universe will magically reward you with a relationship. The universe is indifferent, and nothing in life is guaranteed. But living an active, introspective and compassionate existence will definately boost your chances of finding a relationship at some point. Just stop trying so hard, and you may find it happens sooner.

Also, you really need to stop viewing women as a united alien race. They are human beings with a different gender to you. That's it. Don't blame women as a whole. Every single person is an individual. ""Women"" is not the name of an organised army who look to crush the the relationship dreams of men. They are just people, like you, looking for happiness and meaning. Stop buying into the bullshit misogynistic conspiracy theories that you see online.",0,0,2018-08-04T03:36:22.000Z

"There has always been a portion of the male population regardless of race or  ethnicity  that do not reproduce , this is nothing new.
These men regardless  of any amount of self improvement that they do, have been written of by women. Some men based on  their appearance  allone , ONLY   get  NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT  from women , for example when women say '' he  creeps me  out''  it has nothing to do with his character,  but all to do with his appearance body/handicap  or  his face!! Some women even go so far to show a  high level of distress! when a unattractive male/males  are in the vicinity (making  faces of disgust or  saying ''ewww' making it obvious that they are disgusted  by his presence ').In worst cases some of these men have even been called  '' pedophiles''  and ''rapist'' solely based on  their looks. 

Now on the other hand some  men will ONLY get POSITIVE  REINFORCEMENT from women, and this is solely based on their appearance  allone  NOT character  , they can have a  shit character but women don't  care, they will still have relationships  with these  men. Jeremy meeks is perfect  example of this.
 women call these men  ''assholes''  or the  newer term ''fuckboys''. calling them fuckboys doesn't  hurt their  reputation it only virtue signals  to other women that ,that male is dating material.


The  way you look determines if you get NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT or POSITIVE  REINFORCEMENT from women and  society  in general. Being unattractive  hurts your chances in getting laid as a MAN and making it   in this world . women  care  about looks more than men do.A handicap woman gets  more sex then a handicap man  or  able body men in general ,so don't tell me looks don't matter

"Sad in many respects. Some of the smartest people I know have a hard time talking to women. And, yes, if you're too afraid to have a conversation with a woman because your hopes are up, desperation don't look good on anyone. But this idea of ""Chad"" and ""all females reacting to him"" is also ridiculous. I wonder what type of women these guys are going for- if you're upset some bleached-blonde material girl is not interested in you, chances are you're not a good fit anyway, so why be upset? There are plenty of women who AREN'T being pursued by these ""Chad"" types, who are into nerd/anime culture (no offense intended #nerd+) and would probably at least be friends with these guys. And really, most people don't go to bars/clubs meet and hookup and that's the world of dating- it's generally being friends, getting to know someone, bonding over shared interests, and then a relationship develops (women take a while to warm-up to men). But also realize they're trying to avoid being involved with someone who has the potential to hurt them in one way or another (aren't we all?).

Bottom line: pursue your interests, pursue meaningful friendships, and the rest will follow. Let the Chads do their thing, be happy you aren't with the women who give Chad the time of day (you're probably not compatible anyway), but certainly don't explode, implode, or take out your frustrations on yourself or others - get creative. Take a cooking class, go do some yoga.... Pretend she's a guy and treat her the same you would any other person you're just meeting or getting to know - if you look like you're just talking to her because you're attracted to her, you don't know her and you're just as shallow as Chad. And think of how much she already has to deal with in this world - be a refreshing change .",4,1,2018-08-03T16:17:51.000Z

I don't think shitting your pants in a group chat with a bunch of other people in a state of self loathing and projecting such hatred towards others is much effort to end the involuntary aspect.  Even if they had tried constantly, perhaps they are seeking the wrong kinds of people.  If they are going to give up, I feel there are much more productive ways they could use their time.

1)He is not only blaming women/others since he also admits a lot of incels are that way because of genetic/learned abnormalities.
2)He probably has seen a therapist before and if not its because like most people, escapism/avoidance is the safer option when facing a challenging problem.
3)Lastly. For those saying get up and do something about it smh. He said he has social anxiety, which is usually coupled with depression. Its obviously seriously depressing being an incel since half the people he was chatting to committed suicide. Depression is a motivation killer too. Tackling his particular challenge takes effort/energy which he no longer has due to the depression. It also requires him to submerge into every aspect of himself that makes him feel the most shitty. This creates a vicious cycle and most likely makes his depression worse in the process. 

A way to understand trying to overcome the cycle of depression:
Compare it to trying to overcome any serious addiction. Its often said that you will feel worse before you get better and it will most likely take several runs at it. This prior knowledge/ experience is why many people are unable to, or why many people just avoid attempting to quit all together. 
They end up falling at the hurdle, which reinforces the grasp of the addiction, putting them in a darker place and robbing them of motivation to take another run at it.

That is why at this point he chooses to sit in his chair and do something that allows him to escape his depressing reality, making him feel good/better temporarily. 

He has given into it...for now.",292,25,2018-08-03T07:55:40.000Z

"Then he needs to get help rather than blame women or whine about his situation or hang out in an obviously toxic environment (seriously, 4 of his friends killed themselves? That ain't a healthy normal environment).

I'm autistic, have anxiety, ADHD and depression (and I'm a virgin also, though that's honestly not important), don't have a job and live with my parents... HOWEVER I went out and MADE myself get help, forced myself to improve rather than wallow in self pity all the time because I didn't want to be a selfish prick and have been doing volunteer work, doing tons more house work and making myself study more and working on my art and recently seeing a therapist and have gotten SO much better because I MADE myself improve. Guys like this need to do the same.

And yes I get it's hard and I've had certain support and opportunities that others in my situation haven't, but that's no excuse not to at least try, and this guy certainly doesn't seem like he's trying all that hard and instead complains a lot about others and resorts to making self loathing jokes and staying in a comfortable zone rather than actually venture out.

He needs his internet connection taken away and forced by his parents or whoever still has contact with him that's actually reasonable not(I'm assuming he's living with someone since he doesn't have a job) to go to therapy and slowly try to go outside his comfort zone or else he's never gonna get better.

And stop acting like you're owed sex or that it's just so unfair that women aren't attracted to you, we're not objects.",2,7,2018-08-03T06:13:02.000Z

"Alexander Layko incele are sexualy frustrated, lonely men (mostly men) with a shitty self image (similar to girls influenced to look like photoshopped supermodels at a young age who resort to extream measures like anorexia/balemia/self harm to achieve that ""perfect"" state). 

Most of them are probably docile trolls constantly looking for some sort of human connection beyond the isolated, depressed and anxious lives they lead, So they resort to extream measures to gain status in their social heiricarchy including a dopamine hit for doing something unexpected like making terroristic threats in front of your friends.

To be honest the belief that men deserve sex just because they were nice/courteous/friendly is one of the biggest turn offs for women. Their group just reinforces this negative mindset and their toxic behaviour leads to more self hatred, loneliness, and disconnect from the outside world. People need people they can connect with but in this case it's smimiar to drug addicts reinforcing their drug addiction by hanging out with other drug addicts. It's very sad people like this exist today, makes me wonder what would of happened to people who felt this way 30/20 years ago when the internet wasn't a thing, would they have forced themselves to go out and interact ?

"Instead of stewing in self-pity and bitterness, which is a sure path to self-destruction, start on getting your shit together. 
1. Learn some in-demand skill. Programming is a good one; and you can learn it from the comfort of your own home. If that's too difficult, try software testing. A year or so of learning full time should be enough for a solid base in either of these.
2. After some months of learning start working on making the case for why you deserve a job as a programmer/tester. Contribute to open source projects, build a portfolio (if going with programming) and make a resume.
3. Start applying for jobs and going to interviews. Research common interview questions and practice in front of a mirror. This will probably take a while. Learn from every failed interview and apply what you learned on the next interview. Eventually you'll almost certainly get a job. As I said, these skills are in demand.
4. Now you have a decent job making respectable middle-class money. Nice. Suddenly you have disposable income and a lot more control over your life. And, for what it's worth, are now more attractive to the opposite sex.Take a moment to relish the fact that you now have a skill people are willing to pay decent money for. Let it boost your self-esteem a bit.
5. Sign up for a gym membership and go 3 times a week. It's gonna be a drag the first month or so, but then your body will get used to the routine and it's not a chore anymore. It's gonna improve your looks, which will boost your confidence further. It'll also help cope with the stress of new job and boost overall health.
6. etc etc. At this point you'll already be a functioning adult, and sky is the limit. You'll come across many opportunities to get your willy wet. And even if you somehow don't, then you can just pay a prostitute. Done. Not an incel anymore.

Most of the guys in the room have had sex or are having sex regularly, some are married, some met females THROUGH the chat and there are even females who currently chat. The entire point of the room and the one uniting quality those in it share is a love of gallows humour, satire and a lack of belonging. No one from the room is ""dangerous.""

"Nobody who's commented here so far understands how debilitating mental illness can be. The medicines don't cure you; they make your life with the illness a little bit better by reducing the intensity or the duration of the symptoms. Therapy gives you a set of coping skills, like distracting yourself by watching a YouTube video, that are better than the ones that you thought of yourself, like drinking alcohol. Both help, but it can still be extremely difficult to do basic things like step outside your house without feeling so much emotional pain that your brain begins to suggest suicide to make the pain stop. If they can't even go outdoors, then how can you expect them to be able to hold a job without getting fired or to go to the gym or go on a date as suggested? Clinical words like Depression are used by scientists to group people with similar symptoms together for the purpose of researching what works to make them feel better. Two people can have the same symptoms but one could experience them a lot more than the other person. A lot of these guys appear to have tried nothing and think that they are all out of options. It's hard to feel bad for them when nobody has asked, ""Have tried therapy and medicine?"" But I understand where they are coming from. ""Just be yourself"" is popular advice and they shouldn't have to ""become a Chad"" to have the life that they want. Chads aren't real though. It's a fictional character that they created to hate. Incels should love themselves and want to be the very best versions of themselves that they can be.",1,0,2018-08-02T22:07:57.000Z

If you really think that you're entitled to have sexual relations with any other person you're an idiot.  You're never promised anything in life, why would sex be any different??

"Just because you are a lonely guy doesn't mean you are cursed to live life as an incel/shut in. 
Bonds and relationships take a lot time and through the way you will have a lot of rejection and bumps in the road.

My boyfriend didn't date anyone before me and we met at 24. He had tried to date before but no one took him up on it, so instead, he just focused on school and working out (and no, he isn't a ripped Chad nor am I a Stacy). I was doing floor cleaning at his home and saw we liked similar things like video games, anime, guns, etc. Plus his room was fairly clean, clothes hanged up, furniture was just a bit dusty. So when he asked me out (after talking for a bit while I was cleaning) I said yes, because he seemed pretty put together even if he didn't exactly have financial independence yet. Now here we are 6 years later and living together with some cats. We both have our own hobby rooms/offices, but see each other all the time and support each other's dreams. Were definitely considered ""the weird ones"" in our small group of friends, but even us weirdos can still have a pretty chill and happy life. So If I had any advice for someone still searching for a life partner Id say just focus on bettering yourself first. You don't have to be a ripped chad, insanely wealthy or have a Ph.D. Improvement takes time and small steps. You can't have a good healthy relationship with a whole other person if you can't bother putting time into improving yourself. Good luck. :)",2,2,2018-08-02T18:40:27.000Z

If you see this, just know that I totally understand how you can get to this place in your life. Whether it be social anxiety, a bad home situation, or just being burned in the past at an early age, it absolutely can make someone turn inward. But you're young, you're actually not bad looking at all (which other comments also note), and clearly there was something in you that wanted to speak out to a wider audience, which is why you did this interview. It's never too late to work on making things better. I'm a bit of an introvert, myself. And I have friends with their own such issues, just like you do. 

I know those dudes in the chats tend to be your friends. I don't mean you should just cut them out. But work to expand your social circle. Go do something you never would've before. Hit the gym (although find a good beginner program and maybe someone to work with first. I know you probably find yourself on /fit/ every now and then, yeah? Read the sticky. But stay away from some of the Nazi shit and /fph/ threads.) The gym is a great place to meet people and develop a support system. Trust me, they won't be judging you. Hell, you might even want to try reading some feminist literature. I'm serious on that one.

There's a book I want you to read. It's called New Game+ by Harris O'Malley. It's got some really fantastic advice, not just for dating, but on developing confidence and good habits. I've even had female friends of mine look through the book and give it a definite stamp of approval. The dude knows his shit. The writer actually used to be a PUA, but realized that the culture and attitude they promote was only hurting him, and the genuine advice they do give doesn't need to be married to the more toxic ""women are the enemy"" sort of attitude they have. I think it'll do you a lot of good to read his book, and to browse through his site.

"Before I've meet who is now my wife, I've been involuntary celibate for longer than I feel comfortable sharing online even anonymously. And even though I knew I was a ""catch"" (good looking, funny, intelligent etc), you get this horrible depressing thoughts, ""What is wrong with me?"" ""Why don't women like me?"" etc. During that time I never hated women, but I was depressed by their collective choices, especially female friends who would complain about their boyfriends, or women who were attracted to men who treated them like crap. Then you start to compare yourself to those men, some of which are objectively douchbags (ie ""Chads""), and this deeply depressing and dehumanizing thoughts creep in, ""I am a lesser man"" or at least viewed like that by women. And I want to be clear, it's not that I didn't try and expected a girlfriend will just fall out of sky or something. I hit on literally hundreds of women, on dating sites, at school, at social events even in a few cases in the street. And no, I didn't use any of those cheesy pick up lines or borderline illegal pickup artist crap. I dated at most 2-3 women a year, never lasting more than a few dates and never getting any further than a kiss. That was a horrible period of my life which I wouldn't wish on anyone and those thoughts I talked about before did make contemplate suicide, many many times. But I never did (obviously), I always set myself a cut off date, and whenever it would come I'd push it by another few years. It seemed like it would never get better until one day it did. So I guess what I'm saying is don't make jokes at people like these, unless you were one of them you would never understand what hell they are living in. And if you are living in that hell, I can't promise you it'll get better, I don't know that, but you can't promise me that it won't either. Stay strong and keep trying, don't give up, it's a numbers game after all.",247,38,2018-08-02T15:18:00.000Z

"I’ve been learning about incels since my psych of women class when I first heard about Elliot Rodger. Still don’t feel bad for them. What’s important to understand is how when we are already in a patriarchal culture, men are expected to uphold standards of masculinity while misogyny helps keep women in line so self-loathing men are already propped up to blame women for all the issues (mothers, feminists, girlfriends, women who won’t have sex with them etc). I still have no sympathy.  It’s like they don’t like patriarchy, which is clear how he mentioned the “Chads” have all the privilege, and patriarchy grants specific people privileges, but they still want to keep their male privilege because that’s all they got. A feminist/egalitarian society will possibly prevent gender from creating all these psychological issues that are poisoning people.",0,7,2018-08-02T15:01:32.000Z

But I wonder what a few weeks in a beautiful environment with mountains, rivers, and streams, Beautiful flowers, SUN glistening off a running stream, Birds Singing, etc..., along with someone who understands thier whole INCEL bulkshit!!! When I was 18, I took scuba lessons. By 19 I was a Open Water Scuba Instructor. I taught ALL SOCIAL ECONOMIC LEVELS of people, from extremely filthy rich, to dirt poor ( like their Instructor) and EVERY SINGLE PERSON that I taught SCUBA DIVING, wellll, it CHANGED THIER LIVES FOREVER! Why? I believe that the ocean and bodies of water offer RELAXATION (SCUBA ESPECIALLY) in a Soothing way that no other sport does. It also brings in ADVENTURE!!! Not to mention things that will present in front of the eyes that leave most normal people with a picture of, THE WONDERS OF CREATION. You see it doesn't have to be scuba, it could be any number of things a person could do. The SECRET is finding something that THE BUG BITES!
