"I love the ""it's my wrists, not my 'shitty' personality, literal sub-80 IQ dudes still get laid with nothing to talk about"" argument. Yeah, maybe that guy is sub-80 IQ...sure. 

But he has a personality, probably not as shitty and 'superior', and might be attractive. So between looks and acceptable personality versus shitty looks and personality, yeah, you'll lose! But assuming that looks are unalterable (but seriously, dress better, wash, work out a bit, lose that dorito and pizza fat), the one thing you have a ton of control over is your personality, and expressing anger or distrust because you feel entitled to dat ass is the quickest way to rule yourself out. 

It's really not THAT difficult. If you want a woman who is ""10/10"" for looks, you have to know looks likely matter to her, it is at least a part of her priorities, so she'll have higher standards for looks (not always, but often, especially if they're fit and healthy for example, fitness will be something she'd want in a partner), but that's always who these typically 16 year old kids who don't do anything but bitch about ""normies"" and reinforcing negativity to each other.

"Thank you for making this video. For a few reasons. I've never been an incel, but recognizing ""catastrophizing"" in my own behaviour... Wow, I'd never been able to so clearly see this issue ""from the outside"". The ""late for work"" example is something I do literally all the time. And when it comes to my dating prospects (and lack thereof), I always have the urge to dismiss my own efforts to improve my life (IRL social clubs, trying to get more fit, working on my fashion skills and outward presentation, etc.), and I think a lot of people get caught in this trap -- ""I tried once, and it didn't work, so I should stop trying"". Something about your video has helped me see the fallacy in that line of thinking; making the huge mental leaps into the Irrational Dimension. So... Thanks. Genuinely. This just sorta showed up on my Autoplay, and I'm glad it did.

PS, I think you also helped improve my perception of trans women a little. It was interesting getting the insight into what it's like to be you; some of the failings of confidence you've had to struggle through. You present very confidently, both as a women and a commentator. You have overcome larger barriers than what I presently face - and that's just super inspiring. I think it's easy to cognitively distance oneself from LGBTQ+ people and be all, ""They have a different set of issues than I, they won't have much to say that relates directly to me."" But confidence is a universal concept. Anxiety and depression are things most people will have to face off with in their lives. I can relate to you on those points; we share the ""human experience"", as it were. So yeah... In many ways, thank you for your perspective in this video. It's doing society a good.",1,0,2018-09-22T07:01:41.000Z

"This was a really great video! Although I struggle with a lot of anxieties about being forever alone and never being in a caring relationship, I don't claim to be an incel (for obvious reasons, but also cause I blame myself for being frumpy and unattractive, I don't blame women for it). I really appreciate this take on the subject, particularly the black pill. Maybe our own thoughts make things worse off than they actually are,  maybe neglect and rejection is hard to deal with but we all know that it's wrong to project those feelings of inadequacy by blaming the world at large. There are definitely things that incels do that  can't be justified, ( just because you can't find a girl who likes you doesn't mean you should hate them) But a lot of it stems from a place of self loathing and frustration. Not everybody wants sex, some  just want to belong and feel wanted. That's a real human need.

If the creator of this video ever sees this comment, I wanna say that the points they made were very well put together and that I really appreciate that they took both sides of the argument cause loneliness and insecurity can really mess with how somebody thinks. A lot of the things you said really struck a chord.  It was entertaining and very well written, and it makes me wanna swim in the ocean.",0,0,2018-09-22T04:52:52.000Z

"Thank you for this incredibly informative and entertaining video.

I've never seen myself as an incel, but as I watched the video, I have realized that I have partaken in a lot of the same self-harming ideologies you describe. Instead of directing any hatred towards women, though, it has always been toward myself instead, which I'm starting to realize isn't much better. I've left hateful comments about myself in various threads. I've experienced catastrophizing - which I never learned about before this video - in many ways, including through ideas about romance (take 6-9 out of your list, and that sums up perfectly how I've felt about relationships for the past few years). Even when I have tried improving the parts of me that I dislike, it felt like I was lying to myself about having hope for the future. The possibility that I could be a couple steps away from turning into a ""black-pill"" incel is starkly palpable now, and it genuinely frightens me.",1,0,2018-09-22T03:49:54.000Z
"Don't take this the wrong way, but I suspected something was up when I started watching the video; however, you definitely do a great job of hiding the fact that you are trans--not that it's important, just off-putting when you first start watching the video. I think you sum it up pretty well when you talk about Tinder. The fact that you and other women would probably prefer a ""firing squad of dicks"" rather than radio silence. It really is hard to watch people in certain social circles seem to get ""tons of puss"" when you are experiencing death-levels of nothingness. I would absolutely love to get matches upon matches of women on Tinder, but I am among the less fortunate that weren't gifted with photogenic qualities. What that really means is that, rather than wallowing in self-hatred and thinking that everyone and their mother thinks I'm not worthy of performing an act intended for reproduction, simply for pleasure, I should try other means of interaction that are less photo-involved. Hell, at least I'm not mute and I can talk to a blind girl that wouldn't care about my looks.

One of the most racist, sexist and nonsensical rants I ever found. I could elaborate on just what was so wrong about that video, but, to be honest, right now, this is not the main point of my comment, and I dont want to get too sidetracked.

And keep in mind, although I consider myself a proud feminist, I actually have many friends who are conservatives, and talking to then never inspired on me the same kind of bile, of rage, that Molyneux content inspired upon me...

"Several very insightful points, and I appreciate what you had to say.  I've said very similar things myself on many of the topics.  But it is worth noting two particular departures.  One of them, probably the most significant one, is your disregard of the effects of feminism on the typical behaviors and psyches.  The fact of the matter is, the groups you refer to that dehumanize women have been dehumanized by women in large number for a long time, a fact which you pointedly ignored, even after allowing for the indirect language and sarcasm.  Objecting to the fact that groups of men who are ignored by or dehumanized by women, ignore or dehumanize women, one cannot be surprised, reasonably, and with anything approaching fairness, by a basic causal relationship such as this.  Another significant problem, though, is that you would move the goalpost on who is responsible.  There is a reason that you transitioned male to female.  And this is what brings us to our second point.  You recognize the advantages of being female.  We live in a society in which it is in general acceptable to be homosexual, and where many people recognize the problems inherent in gender roles, rendering gender reassignment overkill, and an adaption based upon a preference.  A bias.  You are sympathetic.  You have some sympathy for males having been one, but your greater sympathy lies with your chosen gender, which is why you chose it.  I could go on, but let me wrap it up for neither your sake nor mine, but for the sake of others, and simply say: feminism is, was, and always will be sexist.  And being sexist will never be fair, and will always be destructive.  It has consequences for males being a sexist ideology that is deeply embedded in our culture at this point, only made more so and the effects more profound by casual dismissals.  Gender reassignment on both sides comes from the illusion that feminism represents reality.  Consider.  Respond if you want.  I'll be happy to discuss it further.  By way of simple demonstration, and yes it's anecdotal, but I have several thousand more,  an ideology that would make mugs, even in jest, that say ""male tears"" is an ideology that dehumanizes.  To add insult to injury, this is an ideology that has completely disregarded the costs to men throughout the generations.  Heart disease, for instance, becomes a significant issue when women begin to suffer it.  Male life expectancy was lower than women's for decades, maybe centuries.  It wasn't of consequence because men were dying.  It doesn't take a genius to recognize the fact that the professional life is bad for one's heart.  That it's stressful, and produces all sorts of stress related illness.  But it wasn't investigated until women were dying.  This is not nothing.  This is not insignificant.  This is in fact profound.  Are the various male groups unhealthy?  Yes they are.  Are they more unhealthy than that which they are directly responding to?  No, they are not.  It doesn't matter whether you attack a person's livelihood for the duration of their life, or you kill them.  The consequences are rather similar.  Both show a rather strong lack of empathy and regard for one's value, one's humanity or lack of humanity.  You haven't considered feminism as carefully as you've considered many of your other points, and you should.",0,0,2018-09-21T04:15:11.000Z

"Digital self-harm is a phrase I absolutely needed to see. I wish it had somehow happened upon me earlier, but a few months ago I had to quit twitter cold turkey because I realized that it was making me so incredibly miserable. I was intentionally exposing myself to internet things that made me unhappy and I rationalized to myself that it was more important to ""keep up with what's going on in the world."" Some of it was politics, but a LOT of it was bullshit internet Discourse that was just... awful. And I just kept going on twitter, constantly, because of that rush, the relief of being in the know, of getting in on all the memes as they happened, because it felt so important to be completely informed always. It's not exactly the same as the incel digital self-harm you're talking about, but it is definitely very similar, and I think a lot more people are engaging in digital self-harm than realize it.",3,0,2018-09-21T01:05:06.000Z

"The 'problem' is feminism is PARTIALLY responsible for this.  Women wanting equal pay for equal work?  How horrible ... if totally fair.  Women want to be promoted right along side their male colleagues?  Beyond the damning reality advancement by merit makes great economic sense, why would we want to do that?  The same goes for women's access to our colleges and universities which make the above possible ... and you have the seeds if this disaster.

Because ... hypergamy does exist.  Who remembers mothers telling their daughters to marry a man with a good career, who makes 'good money', ect?  Next consider how men who have college degrees (thus greater economic prospects) have been willing to marry women without to the number of women willing to do the same?  It doesn't happen.  Women with college degrees want to marry to men with at least the same economic frontiers.  Then take into account women also make up the majority of our college campus crowds and have been since 2000 ... and the ratio is getting 'worse' and by 'worse', I mean 60/40 (female/male) and gap is growing.

Then you have to take into account what is being told to young women, and has been their mantra for decades now ~ they CAN have it all - career, marriage, children and happiness.  This is despite the growing divorce rate and children growing up in father-less homes.  In contrast, nothing has changed in what young men are being told ~ they have to be bread-winners, career-driven, married with children ... and that will somehow equate to their happiness.  They have been growing up seeing unhappy men, divorced men, or 'absent' men.

Roll the clock back three generations when all this whirlwind began and you see young men growing up and believing if they graduated high school they would then get a factory job, marry their high school sweetheart, settle down, get the house, the 2.5 kids and work for the next forty years ... at the same job.  Most women still thought the highlights of their lives would be their wedding days, the births of their kids and perhaps the days those children graduated high school themselves.

The reality is the World has changed.  There is no pushing back the clock.  Women are getting more degrees and will be for some time, if not until our civilization comes crashing downs centuries from now.  They are going to pursue careers (or our economy is most likely f**ked).  That means men and women are both going to have to change their partnership expectations.  I say 'partnership' because as it currently stands, marriage - as in all those marriages which end in divorce - doesn't profit men as much as it profits women and men know this.  Neither men nor women seem all that interested in fighting to make marriages work anymore anyway.

The other, more serious, issue is men are doing a poorer job of expressing what being a 'man' is all about.  It isn't a square chin, or pronounced brow ridge.  It isn't a fancy car, or private jet.  It is about confidence in one's self and an unshakable drive to strive courageously forward in doing what you feel to be right.  It is, in fact, about being fully responsible about the effort which has led you to your current circumstance - the opposite of an incel.  Where are the fathers, uncles and older brothers to these incels to point them in the right direction?  Where have all those masculine guardians gone?",1,0,2018-09-21T00:30:47.000Z

"This video just got me thinking and I just want to write a paragraph to vent just because. I have had self hatred since I was a child because I found it hard to relate and connect with people (there's a bunch of other reasons as well, but I'll leave it at that) and it has manifested in horrible ways. I remember signing up to some social anxiety forum thinking i could find some like minded individuals.  Unknowingly before i knew what an incel was, i had some encounters with some incels who thought all my problems were invalid and It made me feel worse about myself, since I tried so hard to relate and sympathise with them, thinking that we were cut from the same cloth. But, of course i am a woman, so why would they listen to me, all they did with berate me even though i showed kindness to them. I thought lowly of incels, but the thing is, my self hatred has manifested in horrible ways towards others. Instead of romantic love, I would get upset that people did not want me in their social group or wanted to be my friend. This is honestly more pathetic than being rejected as a romantic interest, but what can I do. Because i did not want to be a hypocrite, I stopped talking to people with my problems and try to only surround myself with positive things and made sure I always remind myself that it's better that I keep myself busy and to not make my whole life rely on acceptance from others. I am far from being who I want to be right now, but I just have to accept it for the time being. Incels is what happens when depression and anxiety gets ugly and even though they are horrible people, I still have hope for them even though they see me as worthless meat.",0,0,2018-09-20T22:11:28.000Z

"Whatever hurts is true is a platitude, I think it is most similar to learned helplessness. Those with learned helplessness tend to neglect themselves under the impression that life won't be getting any better than it is, in a dog, it was conditioned in one specimen by subjecting it to pain that it could control by pressing a buzzer or chewing at something - and the other dog could only endure the pain of being shocked until it went away. The dog eventually learned that they were helpless against their situation and 'laid down helplessly'. Sound familiar to you? It struck some bells in my head that it was the same as lay down and rot, because there is 'nothing you can do'.

But what can you glean from that examination? Well the dog had to be subjected to a helpless situation for this to occur, and the same tends to be true of those in reality. They may have experienced bullying to a degree that it has emotionally scarred them, they may have accrued enough pains over their life to 'Assume That It Is Normal (the definition of learned helplessness)'. The idea that these situations are not normal in itself can be a distressing emotional event. It is like the big unveil as that mad doctor who is responsible for the sheer misery of your life admits it and says that there was no reason you had suffered, and someone else has lived a luckier life.

In a way that is not a secret to be learned about life, everyone knows it. Life is unfair. Some are lucky enough to be born beautiful, some with different personalities, to rich families, to brains that didn't manifest psychoses. It is all luck. I guess I don't really care whether or not it is luck because my own experience tells me that no-one gives a shit about how badly you feel for your misfortunes, because they are so selfish already. They have their own lives and worries, they want to be entertained by you. They have expectations of you, (imagine the entitlement!). What's so wrong about me turning around to them and saying that I don't give a shit about what they want? I won't be earning any points from them, but I never tend to anyway. I impress myself. If I looked ugly enough to turn up to one of their parties and they had this hilarious reaction about turning to me with sneers and childish contempt from the babies of the first world and their pudgy fucking fathers I would revel in it.

"There is a pleasure in thinking that you know better than other people do. And a kind of seductiveness to the idea that only negative, evil people, have access to this wealth of knowledge of reality. It is the delusion that evil is power, and, that it will give you an advantage over the other, happy-go-lucky people on the Earth. Who smile, but who you personally see as all harbouring a darkness inside of them, that is antithesis to the ideals that society espouses publicly and hopes to uphold. You would like to be the brainless amoeba, unsophisticated and simple, but wisened and powerful, and you fear being the lamb. The doe-eyed bambi, in front of the oncoming car.

But you are still a fool. You don't know shit because you sold yourself for less than you were truly worth out of laziness and contempt for the rest of society. You have gained no advantages, just a tar-like appearance over your person, that drowns out the good, that makes you seem like that 'heart broken' artist who has suffered but is really contemptible as you were the day you were born to the first world economy.

"I've always felt like an Incel although I've never sought out any sort of community. The very idea seems absurd, so long as there is still even a faint chance to change something. 

I met a friend who changed me in a time of my life in which I became more settled, took better care of myself and so on. I learned how to talk to women without losing my mind, how to be funny, when to be respectful and gentleman-like and when to stand my ground and not be a doormat. 

I married the first woman that would have me. I love her to bits and things are going great for many years now. After becoming married I got a lot more female attention, maybe because I'm more laid-back about the whole thing (or maybe it's the ring, I don't know). 

That being said, when I'm in my head, walking down the street or sitting on the bus, I still feel like an insect next to goddesses, even though my wife would put the vast majority of these women to dire shame by virtue of looks. Whatever I put on when I'm acting normal is definitely a mask. 

I'm saying this because I think there is a possibility that this Incel thing is not the cause but only the symptom of a psychological disposition that lies deeper than anything discussed in this video. 

But in any case, the bottom line of the video is very accurate: Being unattractive is hell, but blaming other people is only going to make things worse for you. Maybe this advise is applicable to more people than just Incels too.",0,0,2018-09-20T07:24:08.000Z

It's unique in that it tries to actually empathize with a group of people sitting so far out on the edges of society that most everyone just agrees to ignore them as much as humanly possible (unless they're natural-born bullies, in which case they'll use them as their barrel of fish when they feel the need to take shots at an easy target).

I am a guy who has been traditionally heterosexual ----and you are definitely an earthquake to that foundation.  I don't mean to frame this in a way that is assuming you are a man at glance, I know that is insulting, I really dont mean it that way----, you were once a man and now you choose to be a woman, and I feel in order to get the point across I would have to approach from the bottom up---- I've had deep thoughts about what love and attraction really is and whether or not biology has ANYTHING to do with it ultimately----   Your metaphors are great you really explain things lucidly.  I apologize if this is stupid you can delete it.  I don't mean to be offensive---  

You are so fucking hot please dont ever change anything about yourself... like that...  of course grow as a person ...but please dont change your mental biology, your brow structure, your jawline, your sexual gear, please....

Speaking for myself, my mate of 15 years was not exactly a Chad...he had broken teeth, a nose like that of a Boeing 747, had suffered a severe spinal injury that made him walk a bit  funny and a drinking problem that eventually killed him, but he was intelligent and funny and reasonably good in bed.

I‚Äôve been watching another YouTuber who thinks these people are part of the reason many don‚Äôt take trans people seriously, because having to respect someone whose pronouns are mew, mews, mewself is too ridiculous.
So I guess... what is gender, and where should the line be drawn, if at all, regarding one‚Äôs ‚Äúgender identity‚Äù? Can beezle gender really exist?

He spoke of being open to honest friendships aka occasional fuckbuddies, possibly open to LTR.  
He suggested a kind of open-ended rule-less ""game"" to get beyond insecurities and annoying desperation, and to be able to walk up and talk to any woman for the fun of it without seeming creepy or needy.  Could say something bawdy and bold without being gross.  He suggested personal self-development to attain that attitude to replace fear and shyness.

"Interesting. 
I... guess I'm an incel? Maybe a volcel? The point is I've been in relationships, they didn't work out, I'd *like* to get into a good relationship but I'm not actually working towards that because.... I dunno, I just don't care enough to try these days.
Women aren't throwing themselves at me and to believe that it's because I'm some sort of genetically inferior subject would be easy but I know it's because *I'm not trying* and that's the truth. 

But the way these individual incels view humanity is unfortunate at the least and detrimental to themselves. 
WE AREN'T LAB MICE
Yes, we are by definition, animals. Mammals specifically. But to see another human or even yourself as a basic animal is not a way to go through life. We're not just humans - we are *people*
I'm a person, You're a person and even those who have wronged you have personhood (f@$k those people but they're still people)

I know not every incel is just looking for sex. I'm sure most are actually looking for a long term, stable relationship where they'll feel that their own love for their partner is reciprocated.
But for those that just want sex... that's easily remedied with a couple hundred dollars. 

For everyone else... Travel. You don't even have to go far. Just take a trip to an adjacent city or another state. You'll see new things, meet new people and have interesting experiences (hopefully good ones). And (to play on the animal nature here) people who have never met you are likely to find you more attractive. You are foreign DNA, but more than that you're a person who could be new and interesting. You could have opinions, experiences and skills that another person might find attractive. And you'll be experiencing those same things but with literally everyone else around you because they are new to you.

To reiterate... If you're just looking for sex that has an easy solution. However, if you're just looking for sex, you probably won't find love. And if you're looking for love... stop focusing on sex and try looking somewhere else. You already ""know"" the people in your own community aren't interested so stop beating that dead horse and do some travelling.

But most of all - learn to love yourself and recognize that your worth isn't tied to something as transient as physical appearance.",1,0,2018-09-17T03:33:30.000Z

"The ego tries to justify its existence by creating an identity related to the body in order to appear real because it is afraid by definition of others instead of unifying with others. This is negativity aka division. Terms such as incel and Chad etc create an identity worldview to replace God ( God as the whole or Spirit or the One if the term God  scares you). The ego sees other selves as enemies and every transaction as a fight for survival of egos. Every ego collides in this imaginary war of identities. In this case incels are the eternal victims of an interconnected 'concpiracy' against them and it tries in every way possible to relate to that going as far as accepting defeat in this algorithm of pain and killing themselves. Most wont because they have divided their ego into other small identities such as 'human', 'gamer','student' etc... so they are invested in more than one identity. All this is a created illusion of the mind. There is no-one here this is a mental construct or a simulation if you will. The choice you have to make is do you want to be happy or not. Most chose unhappiness over undoing their mental addiction. They feel powerless because we give the ego power over us and we think it must be the only think there is. But we are as powerful and immune and perfect in Heaven were we sit in timelessness with God who is our father and we his son's aka his will and his will is Love which is unconditional and infinite. We are expancive energy of light. There is nothing to fear. Just let go and you will be free. Let go of incel let go of terms let go of time. Those who are eager to hear will hear others will mock but offence is not given nor taken. There are no victims. Break the chains you have made for your-selves; they are made of air and you're just willingly imagining they are really there because you feel guilty of sin. Know you are sinless and loved and that your father wants you to wake up and return to were you are wholly/holy. Peace",0,0,2018-09-16T22:14:15.000Z

Fun story: a girl played this in my high school when I was filming randomly in the corridors for an art project. Following the advice of my art teacher, I was going down the documentary-ish kinda feel inspired by the likes of Gus Van Sant's Elephant which, yes, is maybe not the best reference when you're filming in a school. But I had decided to shift it from‚Ä¶ well the mass murder thing to more of a ""the bad thing that happens is that one person self-harms/attempts to commit suicide"" and it was the buildup to that and I would have of course just fictionalised that ending part. But anyways. That girl plays this exact song. And I'm thinking it's brilliant and associating it to Moonlight Sonata in Elephant and I wanted to make it the recurring theme of the short. 

So this exact piece, in a short I wanted to make that was inspired by a film about a school massacre when the subject was planned to be self-harm and suicide. This is basically all the subjects of this video. And‚Ä¶ yeah. I don't know ^^'

"As a man from India, a sapiosexual and MGTOW who has never actually had sex, I've often wondered if I was actually an Incel just pretending otherwise or even gay. But unlike most Incels and gay males, I gravitated towards stereotypical guy things like MMA, existential philosophy from the West - specifically Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger and Thoreau, Eastern philosophy like Bushido most easily seen in Musashi Miyamito's The Book of Five Rings and Hindu religious philosophy like Shiva's many forms and what they tell us about the nature of being itself. So incelling just seems like pathetic wankiness. I also never viewed a trans person as sexually attractive. But (hoping not to be creepy) I do find this person attractive even because I sense intelligence. In fact, I once considered the idea of writing a novella about a man dating a woman and falling in love with her only to discover she is a trans person in an Indian setting and the ramifications of that. So, meeting this person would be prime fodder for that purpose and a decent night out I suspect. But considering I will probably never meet her in person, I decided to write this down.

"It's kind of crazy to me that as a 21 year old woman I actually understand the though process that goes along with the rhetoric of incels. Now let me be clear I DO NOT SUPPORT THE BEHAVIOR, THE COMMUNITY OR THE THINKING, but as someone who grew up extremely lacking in self worth and self esteem, hat eventually evolved into a socially anxious 21 year old with no history of relationships or sexual past (not for lack of trying) I understand the process that goes into this self mutilating thought process. I would think of my self as less than, as unfuckable, unlovable and as a waste for someone to be with, my self worth matched pretty well with the beginnings of incel behavior, the difference in my case is I was lucky enough to grow up in a time where body positivity, mental health and overall self acceptance for women became extremely prevelant in society. When I was upset and self destructive I didn't have the chance to fall into an abusive community because for the most part all of the communities I found as a woman were very open about getting help, understanding your thinking and accepting yourself. I firmly believe that if I hadn't come up in a place where it was acceptable to have feelings, Express feelings, talk about myself and understand my worth I would be a much worse person than I am now. I do honestly feel like a lot of these behaviours stem from thoughts that we've all had and mix with the fact that most men are not allowed to be seen having emotions, can't pursue passions for fear of masculine ideals and have no outlet or positive pushes into society that we women do. And I'm not blaming feminism, women empowerment movements, or even brushing over Incel behaviour, but merely stating that men in today's society have as much pressure to become an ideal as much as women do, it's just with men there is less of an openness in their own communities to understand these feelings and a safe place to discuss the toxicity of it and find solutions.

I‚Äôve always been socially awkward, but never let that get in the way of making friends; however I‚Äôve also always had with low self-esteem. However through therapy, I took the small steps required to climb out of the hole I dug myself into. We are our own worst enemy.

It‚Äôs not a case of one or the other, as some anti-fascists will have you believe. Instead, we recognize that there should be a sensible balance between individual liberty and national health. If individual liberty means, as it does in Europe and America, the freedom to behave in ways that are degenerative not only to the individual, but to the state itself, then individual liberty should be curbed. Fascism is authoritarian and ‚Äúzero-tolerance‚Äù because we recognize that there are such things as good and evil, right and wrong, and that some things should never be allowed.

Rather than focusing merely on freedom for its own sake, fascism promotes excellence. Fascists recognize that people make mistakes, and bad things happen. But that‚Äôs no reason to give in and pretend that sickness is normal. Take the family for example. The nuclear family is, we believe, the core of the state. It is absolutely vital and should be protected. We‚Äôve got a sickening divorce rate, children by the millions being born out of wedlock into unstable, often dangerous homes, or no home at all, being raised by one parent or no parent. The ‚Äúfree market‚Äù has created an environment where both parents are often forced to work just to support themselves, let alone any children they might have. There was a time when a man could work 40 hours a week and support a wife and kids, along with a house and a car. We‚Äôve let those values slip away and it‚Äôs cost us more than we‚Äôll ever know. Fascists don‚Äôt pretend that broken families are normal or healthy. We recognize that children need to be raised by a mother and a father.

Fascists don‚Äôt believe in the sort of false equality that people think of and promote so much these days. We believe in hierarchy and structure, based on natural principles. Men and women are different. We have different tendencies and instincts, strengths and weaknesses. When women try to make themselves men by subscribing to the poison of feminism, they contribute to the destruction of the natural order. We believe that races are different. We have different levels of development, cultures, and modes of living. What works for one group doesn‚Äôt necessarily work for another group, let alone every group. That doesn‚Äôt mean any group has the right to oppress any other group; it simply means that boundaries need to be set up for the good of all. Instead of treating people the way we think they should be treated based on some arbitrary concept of equality, fascists recognize people for who they are and treat them accordingly. Low-IQ individuals don‚Äôt need ¬†to try to conform to western educational standards in order to be valued, and western educational systems shouldn‚Äôt lower their standards to accommodate them. We say let everyone develop naturally, without interference from anyone else.

I could go on, but the last thing I‚Äôll say is that fascists are also committed to a form of socialism. This isn‚Äôt the conflict-based, degenerative kind of socialism found in the doctrines of people like Marx and Lenin. Instead, it‚Äôs a socialism that sees people provided with a supportive system and tools to actually improve their lives, rather than simply lining their pockets ¬†at the expense of others.

There are a lot of excellent reasons to become a Fascist. Do your own research and educate yourself on what fascism actually is and what fascists have actually done. I speak for a lot of Facists when I say that we are deeply disturbed by the lies that have been propagated about these systems and their adherents.",1,0,2018-09-15T14:20:28.000Z

"Fun, reasonably balanced vid.
Definitely being a guy on dating apps can be frustrating.  I think I can craft a pretty mean message, have a decent face, and don't bring up my dick at the earliest opportunity, and even then it took quite a bit of work to get a date I was excited about.  I think it's true that women tend to aim for people who look better than they do on tinder and the like...but it goes both ways.  My friends who are, like, fine-looking I guess, would be left-swiping anyone who didn't look supermodel-esque, because of this illusion of choice.  When you only get opportunities with a few new women every week/month/etc, you're going to give them a chance if you have even a passing physical attraction.  But if you're scanning through thousands of extremely attractive women, suddenly you think you aren't being selective enough if you right-swipe someone who isn't smoking hot.  Because now you have this idea that you COULD get a smoking-hot woman, and it only takes one of them to find your weird wispy mustache attractive!  Why don't any of these supermodels right-swipe you back???

Been in a great, steady relationship with an amazing woman for 2.5 years now, thanks to OKC.  It could be fun, it could be frustrating, but most of all, it was a lot of work.  You might have to do some critical self-examination about how you portray yourself.  But eventually you'll have something to show for it.",0,0,2018-09-14T21:56:13.000Z

"People are afraid to talk about ethnic differences. There's a reason for it; everything that we know about ethnic differences came from a time of hatred and bigotry. In fact, most of our knowledge about skull shapes came from genocide and mass starvation(of the variety induced by systemic forces). And while we hate to admit it, a significant amount of medical knowledge come from Josef Melenge's Experiments. For those of you who don't know, Menengle was SS officer and head physician at Auschwitz. He experimented on people that became unfit for labor.

But it's true. Ethnic skulls shapes are a thing. There's nothing wrong with it. Some of it is due to evolution. My ancestors needed to survive a harsh ice age in small tribes of 14-30 people. In such circumstances, changes happen quick. Hence, my slanted and small eyes. They're there to help me avoid snow blindness.
---------
A cousin of mine's used to work in cosmetics. I know, most people have this internal hatred for the industry, because they feel like it basically lets people lie about themselves. To that I say, bullshit. Cosmetic surgery is just permanent makeup. It's as deceptive as the makeup women wear everyday.

He told me that there's a science for attractiveness. Psychologist have been trying to really pin down on what people consider attractiveness to no avail, but that's only because psychologist have a duty to make sure their findings don't hurt our feelings. My cousin however, was a mean mofo. The reason why we find people attractive is because health is attractive. Yes, that's right. Chad and his muscles and height, his skin tone and unblemished face is a biological marker for health. It's hard science. Stacy is attractive because she's healthy too. It's not a choice whether or not we find these people attractive. They're attractive because we evolved in a way to find healthy people attractive. And it makes sense - you want healthy parents to make healthy children.

But don't let this get to you. Do what I do. I proudly announce that I am by all accounts, a loser. I'm a gamer, I've been one since childhood. I play chess. I read, on my fucking PC no less. Sure, I know how to box and sprag out, but I don't have that look if you know what I mean. I still made friends. I agree, girls can be very annoying(there's even science pointing out that a wife's nagging shortens her husband's lifespan). Just ignore them. Women can't handle as much stress because they don't have as much testosterone to help them with cortisol spikes. Enjoy what you've always been doing.

"I think, to some degree (don't quote me on this or think I'm trying to marginalize, just a thought), almost all teenage guys could relate to the incels, minus the extreme misogyny and suicidal worldview (though there are people who would agree with the latter). I'm a freshman in college, 18 years old, and I've never had a girlfriend, and the farthest I've gone was a stage kiss. All that while I overheard other guys bragging about their sexual conquests and the ease with which they seem to get laid and find intimacy, and I could only think ""what am I doing wrong?"" I was so awkward with women (still am for the most part), partly because I couldn't get the idea of progressing to a relationship with them out of my head and just think of them as a friend. I try to just engage with women or reach out to better my chances of finding one that I could actually start a meaningful relationship with, but it's either a constant friend zone situation or they think I'm harassing them, which is not in any way what I am doing. I'm not a small guy (I'm 6'1"") and I've always been pretty big for my age, so I don't really think I would've associated with the incel community, but I can at least sympathize with some of what they struggle with.

I don't want this to come off that I support or condone what they represent, because it is deeply harmful to guys my age and dehumanizing to women. I simply want to say that, from what I can assume, many of the guys being exposed to this movement initially are in my camp: lonely, depressed and wishing that they could find something real with another human being, and wondering what else they could do without changing who they are to succeed.

"I also feel like one of the reasons incels feel so hopeless is because (Western) society really doesn't teach men to have emotionally supportive relationships with each other. Essentially, they're supposed to rely on their mothers and girlfriends/wives for all their emotional support. So when a man feels denied access to a partner, that essentially amounts to him feeling that he's been denied access to an emotional support network altogether. (Which I suppose is what incels are talking about when they say they'll never know what it's like to be loved). Meanwhile, women are taught to be vulnerable with and emotionally supportive to each other from a young age. That function is just built into societal conventions of female friendship. And heterosexual men in the West aren't even allowed to be physically affectionate with each other, so these dudes are touch starved as well. Which is a long-winded way of saying that if we just let men hug and talk about their feelings with each other they'd probably be a lot less awful.

Men, hug your best bro and tell him about how sad you are. I promise it's the best when your emotional support isn't contingent on all the messiness that comes with sexual attraction and romantic relationships.",1,0,2018-09-13T11:30:16.000Z

Very good video. You are very feminine and reminds me Jaime Murray.,0,0,2018-09-13T06:54:22.000Z
"Jesus. 

At some points during this video I got afraid because I started seeing myself in the descriptions of the incels, but I was then comforted once it got to shit like ""They believe that women did this to them"" and ""Women are inherently selfish"" and all that jazz. 

I am a guy who has very low confidence. Throughout my life I was presented with very little validation, mostly heart-ache, and a general talent for having bad luck. My self confidence suffered heavily from abuse I went through (when I say my luck was bad, I mean that I was molested and orally raped by a female neighbor for 3 years during my childhood, was stalked at age 12, and again at 15, was assaulted and caressed inappropriately without consent by a teacher at 16 and by a stranger in Chicago at 14, lived with an alcoholic mother who would very verbally violent, and I saw try to kill herself on my living room floor when I was in 8th grade, just in general shit never seemed to go well), I really started to believe that I was unworthy of respect and I still suffer from those creeping insecurities at times. 

I guess things that stop me from being ""incel"" is that I hold myself accountable for my own happiness. Now that isn't exactly a perfect worldview I often excused people who hurt and took advantage of me (which is probably why it happened so often) but there are times when I get to my lowest points, and tell myself ""It is not your fault that people hurt you, you were just a child, there's nothing you could've done to deserve it"" and ""You're miserable right now, but are you doing anything to try and feel better?""

Despite the fact that I don't blame women for my problems, there have been times where I'm scared of marrying someone who will hurt and take advantage of me in the ways incels believe all women do. I think it mainly stems from the fact that until recently, I was often ridiculed and mocked for having been abused by women. Today's societal current is changing, and recognizing all types of abuse as terrible is one of my personal favorite changes happening now. 

But despite that, it's been ingrained into me that there's a possibility that my future wife will have a higher chance of receiving our children during a divorce regardless of whether or not she deserves them. And especially the feeling I've always had that if I am hurt by a woman, no one will care or sympathize, because it took till 10th grade for me to find someone who consoled me when I told of my trauma instead of being laughed at (don't worry though, I had a whole group of kids in my science class that year that mocked me for it when I admitted it one day, just God making sure I don't feel too safe in my own skin)

Now I don't like the idea that a guy feeling these things and having these fears is ""incel-like"", because I compare it to woman being afraid of sexual violence. Statistically, that man standing on the other side of the bus stop when you're alone at night, is very unlikely to hurt you. But it's *possible"", and it's *scary*. I myself have been mocked by women and men alike for having a very similar fear towards women when I'm alone with them in public. Yeah, the possibility of them actually hurting me is low, but because of what I've been through, I know that it's possible, and it has me scared. 

I know first-hand through multiple experiences just how exactly women can hurt me, but for fucks sake, it is not a representation of all women. Just like a total piece of shit like Elliott Rogers is not a living synecdoche for men. My ex girlfriends are  not every girl. My abusive neighbor, my hebephile teacher, and that craggily old bitch who stalked me when I was 12 are not all women. I think the incel's problem is that they likely don't even have experiences like this, they see women so far outside the realm of human that they don't get close enough to even know what things can even actually hurt them. And it's not ""women"" hurting you, it's people and human selfishness. Women and men are both equally capable of being cruel and shallow because they're *all human*. 

I think what incels don't realize is that ""the perfect relationship"" doesn't exist, not even between a Chad and a Stacy. Surprisingly enough, Chads and Stacys still have their own personalities. Almost no one is constantly always happy with relationships. Dating isn't easy. I have had three LTRs within the last 16 years, and none of them ended very well. They've done major blows to my confidence and I do believe that I was in the right for all three, and even if it has made me hesitant to date it doesn't change the fact that I love women and hope to one day be good enough for the one that will be good to me.

"It's sad, but there really is a line. Some people really are incredibly ugly. Some trans people really can't possibly pass as the sex they desire to be without intense surgery. Those are just facts. Our brains are crazy good at facial details, it's why the uncanny valley is a thing. A lot of people in these communities are falsely believing they're ugly or wouldn't pass as the opposite sex, but it's still true for lots of them. How we do hold the balance point in our perception of ourselves? To evaluate ourselves as we are, like we're looking at another person. 

I've done the internet self-harm thing about being a short guy because in my life it really has mattered. Lots of women have told me very specifically they weren't interested solely because of my height, that I'm fun and attractive, but too short. So I know it matters. But I've gotten laid, and by some very attractive ladies, so I know it doesn't matter to all of them. But it is crazy how easy it is to let the dark thoughts build, to convince myself I'm unworthy on so many levels. Glad I never got into hating women, not even when I dove into MGTOW for a while. I believe too much in the primacy of the individual to think a group of people are all the same because of being the same sex. It's hypocritical to claim to be going your own way while focusing intense hatred against women and blaming all your problems on them. Just fucking go your own way, do your thing, embrace life. There are issues in society for sure, but going my own way is primarily about avoiding the sheer work of parenthood, not hating women. I don't trust myself when a horny lady says it's ok to fuck her without a condom. I have historically gone ahead with it and feel so lucky I haven't made any accidental babies. Babies, marriage, and the typical modern life are all very expensive and I don't want to work that much. Rather just live in a tiny house of some kind, garden, and chill with friends.

"DES (diethylstilbestrol) and other synthetic hormones are given to pregnant women for the purpose of preventing miscarriages, but they cause the babies to become transgender. The baby begins developing as one gender, and then a synthetic hormone is given to the mother partway through the pregnancy after the baby has formed the brain and genitals as either a male or female. Different synthetic hormones will have either a feminizing or masculizing effect on the baby.  DES is not being used anymore, but many other drugs have the same effect. Some of the baby's development occurs as either male or female, and then the opposite gender is overlaid on top of that in such a way that the baby ends up with characteristics of both genders, sometimes visible deformities in the external genitalia, and also changes in the brain that affect everything about how they feel and perceive themselves.",0,0,2018-09-12T05:30:04.000Z

"@20:56 That is something a lot of these incels are missing. The coping mechanisms that men learn when being rejected, this is something fathers NEED to teach their sons. This is part of the reason, I believe, people like Jordan Peterson have garnered attention from groups like these. They are literally being told things that is so fucking basic, I'm surprised these guys remember to breathe. I would be considered a ""chad"" albeit I don't think I'm very attractive, 6 on a rainy day. However, I try to be charming, sweet, funny and even know 1 good magic trick to have enough confidence to approach just about any woman. It was something I tried to instill in my son, from a young age I exposed him to saying hello to girls his age, and up. I wanted him to not view women as these beings you're only allowed to interact with when you want your dick wet. I wanted him to have friends who were girls that could give him a perspective on life that wasn't so guy focused, a balance. Granted I did grow up in a house of 5 sisters and mom so I'm more open to this then most men. The ultimate irony as you pointed out, is that ultimately a lot of these men or allowing other men to determine how likely they are to get laid. They are literally, barking up the wrong tree.",1,0,2018-09-12T04:25:51.000Z
"Chadsplaining? Don't tell me this is real, tell me you've made this up! 

Also, I'm not entirely sure where the boundaries of the incel population is. Are incels only those sad crazies on internet forums or are all involuntary celibates incels? Because if it is the latter, then those internet posters may not be representative of the average incel. Also, an incel can't get laid but over what time frames? Because nearly every dude on Earth will have experienced periods of involuntary celibacy. I have, several times. I've also experienced periods where I just didn't want to be with anyone and couldn't be bothered trying to get a one night stand (that invariably implies a lot of rejection before you score and most of the time, it's just not worth the effort).

The other thing is that these guys are probably lacking in life experience. Most of us are desperately average looking guys, we're really missing that Chad factor! But what ends up happening is, even if you don't try too hard and just go with the flow, you inevitably end up finding a girl and sometimes, a girl that you feel is way out of your league. This is a weird feeling at first, you're like: ""What? Her with me? This must be some kind of mistake"". Yes, we're insecure like that. But what you realise is that this stuff keeps happening over and over again. You can't explain why, it always feels like it's against all odds but it does happen, almost naturally (and generally when you least expect it). I'm single right now but there is a zero percent chance that I won't find a nice girl ever again (and that's a 43 years old guy taking).

All this to say that they probably need to experience a bit of life and realise that sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't. I must admit those incels you describe are the only members of the manosphere that I have never met, I've never been to those forums or met any of them on YouTube. But I have spoken to everyone else:

- Plenty of MGTOWs: they're an bunch of angry fuckers (well so to speak), it's impossible to have a rational conversation with them. They kind of remind me of radical feminists, they have constructed a world where all women are evil and mean spirited. Of course the problem with that view is that it doesn't even resemble the real world.

- MRAs tend to be these despondent dudes who have been crushed by women or divorce courts and lament themselves 24/7. They make me sad because they look and sound sad but harbour just enough hope that something will one day improve (but the odds are not in their favour given the way they come across).

- When it comes to anti feminists, one would imagine that I would find some common ground since I'm an anti-feminist myself (I have to really, I'm pro-women!). But most of the time it's an alt-right shit show. I get on better with anti-feminists who follow Jordan Peterson for instance or those on the moderate left.

- Most pick up artists that I have met were relatively fun and, along with anti-feminists, that's the most disparate group in the manosphere. It's a quite diverse bunch of people so there really isn't a typical one. And pick up artists are the only ones that I have actually met in real life. But man, they make a science out of it, some actually read books about it. Fuck me!

But I don't know incels at all. Where can I find good information about them and how do you think these guys can help themselves?

Also, I'm from France and I don't know the local equivalents of the manosphere. They probably exist somewhere but I tend to hang around English speakers online. Surely, this can't just be an Anglo-American thing right?",0,0,2018-09-12T03:49:06.000Z

"I have been pink pilled.

Ironically, this reminds of me of your (least) favorite philosopher.  I'm going to take some liberty with the quote.

""When you stare long into the abyss, the abyss stares longingly into you."" -Nietzsche

""Incels"" is a spark in that it highlights the veiled hopelessness, self-denial, and self-sabotaging behavior behind my current malaise.  I am a failed millennial and a failed adult.  I'm too young for it to be acceptable to avoid social media, but I'm too old to lack long-term friendships.  I've been given more than everything I need to become an independent individual, to escape childhood.  I keep letting my independence whither and die, just as I let my friendships whither and die.

But this is to stare into my abyss, which is decidedly not the point of this comment.  The point is quite the opposite.  Spin matters.  Narrative matters.  Context matters.   The narratives I tell myself direct my behavior.  When I surround myself with self-destructive narratives, I can't help but try to understand them.  And to understand something is to allow myself to resonate with it.  So, to the best of my ability, I must choose to expose myself to stimuli that promote my internal harmony and allow me to create stimuli that promote harmony in others.

That's not a beta cuck cope.  It's a filter.  Sometimes I have the ability to contemplate enormous dissonance.  Sometimes I don't.  Right now, I need to find the stimuli that push me to create again.

Thank you.

Staying away from toxic forums is key to living a healthier life. I identified with a lot of incel ideals when I was a teenager before incel was a thing on the internet and those ideals would have undoubtedly escalated if I browsed those forums at the time. I still have issues socializing with women due to anxiety and autism that I've struggled with for the majority of my life, but I've been seeing a psychiatrist who's really helped me in confronting a lot of my mental roadblocks and I've also met people who've become close friends that have been very supportive and caring which helped to boost my confidence. I'm positive that if these people could receive the help and therapy they desperately need that they could live a much healthier and happier life.

Lemme describe them: 5‚Äò9‚Äù,  has mild autism, has acne and rosacea,  is very underweight  (used to struggle with anorexia :(   ),  has a crooked nose that I adore,  small soft hands,  and rarely goes outside so they‚Äôre pale .  I find him absolutely adorable in looks and mind.  Yeah. He is a man, and I am a ‚Äúfemoid ‚Äú lol. Him and I have been dating for almost a year now and I haven‚Äôt even considered being with another because everything about him makes me so happy.  He is so sweet to me and all around just a generally good person who I always have a fantastic time with.  No Chad or Stacy could ever replace him.  So to all of you naysayers out there,  I am living proof that healthy relationships do exist even for ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù guys/girls,  and that if you aren‚Äôt finding love you probably just have a shitty personality . Take care

"I really like what you said about stratocasters towards the end, because I'm a teenage boy, and my parents are divorced which means I leave in two different houses and have two different bedrooms, and both of them have a stratocaster in them. It really does help with sexual frustration because playing music gives you something to show for all the time spent alone. I've been lonely for most of my life but I went through a period of absolutely devastating loneliness that almost lead to suicide last year. The only advice I ever got was ""just go outside and make some friends"" or ""just get out more."" To which would cause me to think ""if it was as simple as just leaving the house I wouldn't be struggling. I need something more specific, like where do I actually go once I've left the house?"" The internet didn't help much either, the best advice I found there was ""go join clubs or groups that do things you're interested in."" To which I would think ""what groups? Where?"" And so I would just go back to my room and play guitar or bass or drums or sing, and try to get as good as I possibly could so that I at least didn't feel like I was wasting my life. From an outside perspective it probably seems like I spend too much time alone in my room, but I at lest have something to show for it which are my six EPs that I recorded everything on (guitar bass drums and vocals) meanwhile most of the people I know who have lots of friends and get laid all the time have never written a song in their lives, let alone recorded one. The things they invest their time in are temporary whereas the things I create will last forever. I'm not trying to say I'm somehow better than those people, I'm just trying to say that being alone isn't all bad. Those people have something I don't have and I have something they don't have. While people like me spend much of their youth feeling miserable, the people who become superstars are the people who have way too much alone time, because they'll do anything to feel like their not wasting their life, and they end up creating something admirable.",66,7,2018-09-09T20:01:25.000Z

"One of the easiest 1 vid subs I've had in a while. Not sure what it is, but I love seeing this new trend in not attacking the subject, but rather exploring it and trying to reach some understanding. It's all too easy to make fun of something that reminds us of parts of ourselves we don't like and let's be real, every person has gone through some form of uncertainty and insecurity before.  There's such a wide range of emotions about this subject for me,  as someone that wasn't great with girls when I was young, and turned that all around as I grew more mature, and kind of ended up too far the other way in the end.  It is so very interesting to see so much more than just the title ""incel"" without having to bath in the black sea of the forums. Safe to say that they would regard me as something along the lines of the pick up artist. Except it's not that. It's just don't be creepy to be around, but do be fun to be around. It's that simple.  

The one thing I am convinced of however is that somewhere along the way, as I was growing up, I got this strange sense of how things were supposed to be. I presume a lot of it was movies and TV that tried so hard to teach me that being a good person was reward enough, and somehow turned that message got into being a good person is a job and you get paid in pussy. Clearly, that's insane, and flys in the face of just being a good person. If you are doing something for a reward then that's a job, and that's not you just being a good person. And like any job yeah, I get why people would be pissed if they don't get paid, but circle back around to, being a good person is not a job. 

Lastly, just to touch on a more personal point, but please don't you dare touch that beautiful face. As one who has at times been very invested as to how feminine a face looks, your face so very easily sails past that test.",15,0,2018-09-09T18:07:43.000Z

"Deftly avoiding the red herring of the proposed incel worldview was a nice touch.  I think it's mostly a way to justify or explain their intense self loathing as you said with the razor comment. Though i wonder how much of the incel community is affected by body dysmorphic disorder. They seem to show  symptoms of it (the distrust of those who claim they appear fine and what not. ). Our society seems predisposed to associating appearances with complete value to be honest. People who look wrong are wrong or people who look ""gross"" can be of no true value, or that's the sentiment i observe at times. I wonder if this is an inevitable part of humanity or an error of our times that will be remedied eventually. I also wonder personally whether or not some sort of idealism backed reclusion from this kind of materialist appearance-is-worth sentiment is a good choice. I think it could have benefits for mental health but it also ultimately seems like a kind of escapism. It's an interesting issue nonetheless that i think manifests in a lot of places at the moment.

"If all seems lost, in toxicity and in society, search and seek the lost/hidden knowledge. All ""holy"" scriptures are all the same and are not tyrannical, unlike society in it's present form(s), I also recommend the study of alchemy, in all it's forms, botany/botanical alchemy. (Too soon?) It can be good or bad, depending on your emotions and negativity and/or positivity, so the results will be accordingly. You then will probably find eating more of a higher plant intake, (if socital medication doesn't interfere, in the form of ""allergies"") can help you emotionally and in fixing stability in your body, as a whole, more, im additon of ridding other things deemed, to give society more money, while killing us and fuelling our addicting toxic natures. If reincarnated, we were probably born as both male and female, if in other lives. Yin and Yang are within us all, good and bad, male and female energy, so why should we give a rat's arse/ass?? Welp, besides society, rn... So as u are both God and Satan, within, unlock those 7 coloured chambers (chakra, ""churches"") and let your rainbow shine, within, with no fear and cast off your ego/false sense of self, in unconditional love~ (By then u may barely even ever want sex, again, and would be fullfiled, in peace and contentment~)

"I appreciate that you made a video that is very fair but also harsh towards this community.

As a 20-year-old guy who has pretty much no sexual experience (not without a lack of trying), I have to admit that a lot of the blackpill/hopelessness stuff becomes really hard to resist after awhile.

I have never really gone down the rabbit hole of being super misogynistic (at least I don‚Äôt think) and I have never called myself an ‚Äúincel‚Äù, but I do understand a lot of the bitter behavior that these people exhibit.

I think we are definitely in a crisis with masculinity and I think we have a lot of different interpretations of how we can try and preserve masculinity without turning it into a toxic, sexist identity like it‚Äôs been interpreted in the past.

I know you‚Äôre not a big fan of Jordan Peterson but I do think that he is helping a lot of people get out of this mentality, he certainly helped me with some of that.",39,15,2018-09-07T18:34:05.000Z
"Every time I see anything about incels, I can't help but remember how I narrowly escaped becoming one myself. I have tasted the depression and anxiety that comes with it.

That level of depression isn't something I'd wish on *anyone* and it's why it's impossible for me to be completely unsympathetic to their suffering.

A man being friends with women is extremely underrated. They were both taken so dating either of them was out of the question from the start. But I had become close with them -- close enough for me to have talked about my troubles with them. Needless to say, their words weren't lost on me. They may very well have saved my life.",63,2,2018-09-07T18:33:55.000Z

"Some thoughts ...

Elliot Rodgers was actually quite good looking. His celibacy was therefore down to having an unpleasant personality - at least towards women. This is reflected in incels' general contempt for women and the use of words such as 'femoids'. Why then do incels claim to be unattractive physically? Because they want to put their celibacy down to something they can't affect and not down to something that they can change - their behaviour and  attitudes. They are running away from being responsible for their own situation. I have known women who have done the same thing - finding it more comfortable to claim that the breakdown of our relationship is due to me losing sexual interest (which she could do nothing about) rather than listening to my complaints about her behaviour (which she could change).

Incels are not complaining that no woman is interested in them. They are complaining that no Stacy is interested in them. They dismiss the majority of women as Beckys (interestingly also a generic term that some black women use for white women). Incels are not opposed to a world in which 20% of men get all the sex. Their complaint is that they are not part of that 20%. Where does this sense of entitlement come from? My guess is the usual reasons why people start to favour an authoritarian society, be it socialist or fascis, and a rejection of a liberal economy and society that has failed to assign you the position at the top of the hierarchy that you feel is your due. This would include men who have gone to elite schools but who struggle to enter elite professions. Men who have achieved academic qualifications that are not valued outside of academia. Men who consider themselves to be a member of a superior race but who find women preferring men of a different race. men who find themselves supplanted at work by intelligent women. There are probably also some other explanations for why men turn into incels: simple misogyny and men whose interests are not shared or are derided by women (think 'nerds'). in general, however, that degree of hatred for women can only come from a sense that his own position in society is sliding inexorably downward.",154,10,2018-09-07T11:56:55.000Z

here I might align just a tad with incel thinking...I think women will only hook up with a man if they find him physically nice on the eyes.

The extent to which they have to invent a new language understandable only to the in-group pretty much gives away two things: 1- their use of sciency-techno-babble is an attempt to have the credibility of science without actually doing science 2- if ordinary, everyday language were used to say what they mean, it would get destroyed in two seconds, so word salads have to be made up in order to murky the waters and claim to be misunderstood.",1,1,2018-09-06T19:21:14.000Z

It's the eating disorder equivalent of LDAR, in a way: sit back and let the illness kill you.

So, as with the skull-shape obsession and extreme obsession with perceived attractiveness and/or fuckability and/or passing, this is something that comes from societal attitudes to food and weight; it's not something they just pulled out of nowhere. Positive support involves challenging those ideas, but that just feels like you're being coddled, and the reality of the world is being denied in favour of ass-pats and twee, pointless affirmations.",0,0,2018-09-06T09:53:26.000Z

Before that I could only see the flaws in things, myself or others. That it came from, to be blunt, a couple of years of dating (late starter there) and seeing the lust in partners eyes when they saw me that really did it. I think if someone got to me at 15 I would have been convinced of it all.

With the irony of that being I've later looked at pictures of me at 15 just out the pool or whatever. Amazing what being one of the tallest boys in my class and playing sport 5 times a week will do for you.

"After I learned what Incels were I was intrigued so I decided to dive into their forums, and watch a couple of videos of actual incels talking and all that and kind of came out with the same conclussion you did. I can't even hate the guys (even though their posts are misogynistic as fuck and their whole ""subculture"" is disgusting) because I mostly feel sorry for them. Most of them seem like socially awkward people that have been ostracized and most likely bullied all their lives. That level of bitterness, anger, hate and sadness can't come from anything else but that.

That's not to say I sympathize with them or that it justifies the misoginy and racism this people spit on the forums, but you know, I get where most of them are coming from. I've been dealing with depression myself for the past... I don't know, 10 years? (I can't really pinpoint when it all started but it's been about a decade now) and during the worst time (which was 8 years ago) I was in a very dark place. A lot of self hate and suicidal thoughts during that time. Luckily I wasn't alone and it eventually got better, but had I been alone, had I felt like society was against me during that time, I would have probably ended up with the same amount of hate and bitterness this guys dissplay. Specially if that was the norm for my entire life, you know, if I hadn't had any friends and shit like that growing up, if I was socially awkward, if I was bullied as a kid... this is how I would've probably ended up.

I'm happy you didn't just cover incels on a surface level and instead tried to explain how someone may end up as fucked up as these people are. Again, not that ""going deep"" justifies or excuses any of their behaviours, but from what I've read in incel forums and saw on incel videos, most of this people just have extreme mental health problems (mostly depression). This aren't your average misogynistic cis gender white men, this aren't your average Jordan Peterson's or your Ben Shapiro's, because those guys had normal happy lives and still ended up with a lot of hate inside of them. This are just fucked up lost kids, who don't even seem to know how fucked up they are.

So again, I don't really hate incels, I just feel sorry for them.

"Really interesting stuff! I've had the general idea about the unpleasant incel community down, but I've never seen a in-depth analysis like this that got down to the nitty-gritty without demonizing them (though they are still very bad overall) or sympathizing them too much. 

It still does seem strange to me that these people go to places like these not for support or encouragement, but simply to engage in communal misery. Like you said, though, it's not something rooted just to incels, so I guess it speaks to just an unfortunate aspect of humanity. (specifically men, in this case.) 

Though I still don't quite get the whole Chad/Virgin dynamic. Like, sure, they're the virgins, who they mock, and yet they also mock the Chad for being superficial and stupid, while also hating both Becky and Stacy, for different reasons. It's just a mixture of self-loathing and somehow also projecting that hate to everyone else. It seems legitimately toxic and dangerous. Is there any group they don't hate?

I don't mean to defend Pick-up artists, but at least their ideology is consistent. They have a rigid view of gender and dating, and they try to change themselves to fit that imagined worldview in a way that suits them better. Incels just seem to stew in their own misery while also just being generally hateful pricks. It's pitiful in its own way, but at the same time, this mindset easily lends itself to actual violence, which is terrible. Plus, the non-violent misogyny is bad too. For all their woe-is-me talk, they don't even believe a meaningful non-sexual relationship can exist, and concepts like non-sexual love seem beyond them. They're just about getting their dick wet, which is only so sympathetic. 

And of course, the grand irony is that by going to these communities and reinforcing these ideas, they are only becoming more and more unpleasant people, which means women are less likely to want to be around them, which causes them to become more lonely, and more miserable, and so they go to these forums that reinforce that misery, and so it goes. I swear, the only thing missing from this is some kind of grift. (and I'm sure it exists in some fashion.) Profiting off sad, miserable losers seems like it would at least explain who benefits from this horrid movement.",2,1,2018-09-05T07:31:41.000Z

"I appreciate the candor & humor in your videos, Contra, even when dealing with subject matter as dark as this can be. 

Jesus, the incel skull talk & obsession is just... 

I am not an expert, but I have seen a *lot* of human skulls, both in person & in photography (a consequence of amateur study of war history). I would almost absolutely guarantee that in a blind study, nobody would be able to tell the gender of a skull if given no other context. If just presented with the skull, not even an expert in anthropology would be able to accurately state the gender. 

The other thing you notice pretty quick after seeing a lot of skulls (especially if they are all together, in say either a mass grave or a memorial like a catacomb) is just how little variation there is. Human skulls are very, very samey. In 100 years time, if someone were to exhume the body of Brad Pitt & the body a random 'incel', and present both of their skulls for identification without further context or information, nobody would be able to say which one was Pitt's.",27,2,2018-09-04T07:07:47.000Z

"""I don't want to mock them or insult them"". Well, can't say you reached that goal... This was extremely insulting, sarcastic and condescending. I come from 4chan where an engineer was richsplaining me about something and recommended me this video... In a western country like France, 20% of men aged 50 have no children (will never have children), and this number has soared in the last decade, while the number for women, 13%, has remained stable. So this is not a 4ch or reddit mental disease. There *is* a collapse of traditional social structures where refusing to marry was seen as bad (everyone married, if you didn't find someone yourself, they found someone for you, and the incel *dreams* of that, as something better than nothing). Now it has indeed become a market where we're told that merit is eventually free to rule. Those internet communities make a good point of proving that people with low value on the market are not necessarily bad people, evil, or lazy. The Christian God, esp. the Catholic God (call me bigoted...) doesn't believe in merit. He gives his grace to all of us, or to who he wants, but only a conceited man thinks he has more merit than another, like thinking the 20% of men who don't have children are necessarily bad, evil, or lazy.

You attack weak enemies, like subreddits and PUA authors. But those ideas are explained much more clearly by Alain Soral, Otto Weininger, or Michel Houellebecq, who won the Goncourt Prize for best book of the year recently. You're not doing any good by trans-splaining that heteros should just take a shower or stop hating, you're not doing any good denying deep transformations of society. Houellebecq explains that by breaking traditional social structures, laissez-faire capitalism brought about an ""extension of the field of struggle"", meaning that before, there was only a struggle of social classes in the work field, for money. 
In the intimate life, everyone had a wife and children. Now, even the intimate life has been contaminated by the heretic, Protestant, anglo-saxon ideology of ""merit"". Family and villages don't find a suitable partner for you anymore, you have to enter the field of struggle, and yes, in such anarchic systems, the 1% get a huge piece of the cake, while 20% get absolutely nothing. Oh yeah, take a shower... Well why don't *you* go take a shower, mocker? You're not helping anyone, you just alternate between sarcasm and condescending. At least you're getting your attention rush.",2,4,2018-09-04T02:41:43.000Z

"Thank you, really thank you. I'm a woman and I'm not entirely sure why I watched this video to begin with, but your section on digital self-harm really resonated with me. I was bullied throughout my childhood. I was born cross-eyed. Surgery fixed me to a point, but I was left with an obvious wandering eye. Childhood was a never-ending parade of people calling me ugly. It ended when I hit 16, but I realize that I kept the harm going through the things I looked at online. Gross body shaming blogs, ""realist dating coaches"", etc. I found some way to intellectually justify the way I was treated. Ugly became an identity, so much so that I openly refer to myself that way. I put up with a lot of shitty behavior because I've always assumed I'm too unattractive to expect much more. Perhaps I am ugly to most people, I don't know, but I can say you're right about the catastrophic thinking and self-damaging behavior. I need to get a handle on myself.

I will also say that so much of what these men want makes no sense. Women talk to other women about celebrity gossip because they are engaging in ""social grooming"". It's a legit thing. Society bashes it because they hate all femme behaviors. Like women who wear lots of makeup. You are expected to be pretty, but you can't work too hard at it or you are vain. It's as if they want purely masc personality is a femme body. I am dead clear with the cismen that I am 300% femme and do not feel the slightest bit bad about engaging in femme beahviors.

"20:50 had me in stitches almost falling off my chair laughing.  ""At least these pricks care enough about my pussy to be an asshole about my dick"" is comedy gold and I love it.  XD

Anyway, this video was a roller coaster that led to some really interesting places.  It also explains why (aside from just being an already well-adjusted person who has functional empathy) despite being a 30 year old virgin, I largely avoided the self-hate-spiral of despair.  Because when I was at my most vulnerable and busted (post first breakup), I got the best advice I've ever heard.

I happened to go to a dating panel at a local anime convention, and the speaker said, post-his-long-term-relationship-failing that he had a realization.  ""I could either lie down and rot, or I could get awesome. I chose to get awesome.  You guys should too"".

That lightbulb moment, plus a lot of other general advice, was what made me realize that rather than wallow in self-pity and misery and mental self-harm, I could change what was making me miserable, grow a spine, and reforge my emotional foundations into something I could be happy with.  4 years later, I'm perfectly content with my life despite still being ""hashtagforeveralone"".  In fact, my life's been pretty freakin' great in a lot of ways.  The thought that I could have missed that epiphany and continued that death-spiral down into total misery forever is kinda scary.

That being said, despite my sympathy for the self-harming death-spiral stuff, I can't sympathize with the incel community.  The second someone thinks that they're entitled to sex and that it's unfair that they're not getting it, they lose me.  Sex, love and affection are a two way street, and you can't force someone to give it to you.  It's like saying that Hamburgers are amazing, and that if no one is making one for you for free, then the world is unfair.

Anyway, this was a super insightful video, and it's making me consider yet again why I keep going into the religion and politics section of my usual forum, knowing full well that some people are going to argue things that are just plain infuriatingly terrible and that they're going to shrug off my 6 paragraph response and double down on the stuff that infuriates me, which is just plain unhealthy.",0,0,2018-09-03T20:00:55.000Z

"As a trans man, I can fully support your view of tinder. Pre-transition I was SWAMPED with messages constantly, much to my surprise as a very overweight nerd. While I am gay and don't message women all that often, just trying to strike up a conversation via tinder is like pulling teeth, and lord knows I'm trying not to be ""needy"" by continually trying to get replies. It is very easy, even for me, to believe that the lack of replies is because there's something wrong with me (usually due to being trans, but bad skin and weight is equally viable) rather than just I'm not his type, he's busy, tinDER DOESN'T NOTIFY YOU UNTIL IT POPS UP TO SAY YOU HAVE 59 UNREAD MESSAGES. Its very easy to internalize that rejection when all you're seeing is your own perspective, and it's easy to get into that ""forever alone"" mindset.

"Thank you so much for making this video.. You might not even read this comment but this is such a good, more insightful explanation than my vague-aproximate knowledge about it. I think my now sister (I say ""now"" because semi recently she's wanted to transition to be a woman) might.. be... or might have been? part of the group you mentioned, the TTTT?... You left my jaw hanging there because.. she's mentioned some terms and has demonstrated being interested and having read/listened to many topics treated in 4chan, by the alt-right and more groups, very toxic ones, and... nothing... I think this will be good to show to another family member that's having to deal with her directly everyday (I cut contact with her long ago..) to understand her (quite aggressive, very hermit and v toxic) behaviour better...
 This family member doesn't know how deep and negative the internet can go so and my sister is making it super hard for him to help and this family member doesn't know how else to deal w it to succeed in helping her transition and live better... even more so when these subjects are mainly originated in the US, right? (and anyone else of course that is willing to join thru internet..) We are from south america and these issues are unheard of basically, our society doesn't have THAT much contact w the internet itself? Facebook, maybe instagram... and that's it. Incels, 4chan... these are hyper strange things to mention here. So the ppl who get into them on the internet... well it's almost a lost, alien cause and a huge question mark as to how it originated for everyone who isnt surfing in another language and going rly deep into foreign sites...

"Chadsplaining!? I am sorry, but...lol! Microaggression!? I find it amusing that they whine about feminism, but use the same rhetoric Milo and Co mock feminists for using. 

Does this mean they wouldn't be into talking about Buddhism? The first Noble Truth of Buddhism is that suffering permeates all existence. The statement of the Buddha relevant here is ""Association with what is disliked is painful; disassociation with what is liked is painful; not getting what one wishes is painful.""

Noble Truth 2 is that desire/craving is the cause of suffering.

There is a book called ""The Way of the Bodhisattva"" by Shanti-Deva. In discussing the book, Buddhist nun Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n gives the example of someone walking on thorns in their bare feet, and then fussing that no one puts leather on the thorns. The idea is that one short put leather on their feet, as it is less painful to walk on thorns with shoes on. The point is that pain is inevitable, but suffering isn't: it is how you mentally reply.

The first time I heard about this whole Incel thing was when that good looking kid went on his killing spree and I always wondered how he got warped enough to do such a thing. To me, it never made any sense. This video made me very happy that 4chan and reddit, and all of that wasn't around when I was getting shot down like the Marianas freakin' Turkey Shoot. I went through hell to find the love of my life and we've been together for almost 25 years. And I know others go through worse every day. Thank you for this video.",1,0,2018-09-02T06:28:36.000Z

Those undesirable little men will go to amazing logical leaps in order to craft a world where everything is always everyone else's fault. It couldn't possibly be that said Incel's behavioral traits are undesirable, and therefore unworthy of propagation. Nooooo... they'll just blame it on others and some elaborately constructed beliefs to justify their weak egos. 

Seriously, if an Incel wants to get laid, he just stop being little whiner and instead try to become a better version of himself. You know... someone who doesn't both objectify and show active disdain for the very thing he so desperately craves.",0,0,2018-09-02T04:12:55.000Z

"Hello World. I am in the most literal sense, an incel. I am very small, social phobic and had a very neglectful and empty childhood with more-or-less alcoholic children for parents. I often feel that I am a completely broken ""man"" (being small I don't feel more than a boy). I have had one girlfriend by some stroke of luck, but she turned out to be the kind of girl that cheats on every boyfriend she has (at first I thought it was just me of course yay!).

However despite my bitterness and often life-threatening depression, I was fortunate that I did not turn misogynist to ease the pain of perpetual isolation and the haunting memories of being loved but feeling I was never worth it to begin with. Instead I directed that pain into myself all these years... becoming as you have said, full of ""deluded self-loathing"".

I have learned through your video that I have essentially black-pilled myself. Indeed your video was so thorough I've learned a GREAT deal about myself despite never being a part of the incel community. I happen to relate very deeply to many of these men.. and my heart truly goes out to them, because I know the deep suffering that comes with being rejected by.. the only thing that you really want, the one thing you feel you can never have (no I don't mean sex on it's own). It is tragic that it leads to such hate. See how men break without women in their lives! I know all too well.

Saying all that, I was wondering if anyone out there could help dispel these self-defeating notions that incels have? These are beliefs that I have internalized despite not even being introduced to them... I would really love to have a more positive view instead of my current hopelessness (especially about being short, it really does seem like one of the most important things you can be in this world as man).

 I am so very truly my own worst enemy.

Thanks for the video, keep being awesome.",285,59,2018-09-02T03:46:01.000Z

"Claims to not want to mock, lecture, or sympathise and simply wants to get to know who they are.
Then proceeds to create a video mocking and lecturing with a little bit of sympathizing and doesn't bother to get to know them.

They view legit scientific study through an ideological lens (happening a lot as of late) and so they seek comfort by reaching out to others who are in the same situation (which is natural).  It's similar to going to those self help groups except there is no counselor or therapist present on these forums.  Without the guidance, they devolve into echo chambers.  This creates a feedback system that turns a bad situation into a dire one.

They should not be putting the blame entirely on society since many of their issues stem from unfounded insecurities.  On the other hand, society should not be putting the blame entirely on them because the science is there and so some of their insecurities are founded.  

Last I just want to mention about the focus on sex.  This may be at the core of some of the incels views but for many, they are not interested in casual sex.  They want a committed relationship.",0,0,2018-09-02T02:37:30.000Z

"I identify a lot with the points, er, Contrapoints... points out in this video. Point.

I sued to spend a lot of time on 4Chan back in the day. I never really bought into the racial hatred (being Puerto Rican and knowing first-hand how much crap we get in the first place). I just let it wash over me while I downloaded pictures from titty anime.

I don't even remember what sparked it, I just remember realizing, ""These guys are angry at the world and have internalized the anger so much that they've made this reactionary anger their way of life, and they'd be so much happier if they would just help themselves and get over it.""

So I left and never went back.

There is a degree of voluntary self-harm to it all, and they're cruel to each other almost by design, and it's all just a toxic mess that nobody should get into. Glad I got out of it. I hope they do soon.

"WTF! Sexual Marxism?! Hah, that was a curious one!!
Obviously, one can never force someone to sexually select someone - but it's fair to point out problems with the dating/mating sphere. A lot of people are just totally left out. Just like many of the unemployed outside the jobmarket!
And there might be some truth to the claim, that many women would be incels, if they were born as male. Hypergamy is certainly a factor - at least for now. I hope a lot of these unbalances are a socially constructed product of capitalism though, I just doubt it.
And by the way, why do you think many of those nerdy men (actually) views women that way? If they've been rejected their whole lives, it impacts their thinking - people can go crazy if they never attain anything, the same way poor people can turn reckless and violent (without saying sex is an entitlement - it's just a factor that it has an effect on people regardless).",1,0,2018-09-01T01:37:28.000Z

"Tbh pretty great video. A bit annoying at some of the SJW oversimplification, but pretty good. Only thing I‚Äôll say is that with the whole online dating thing, it is DEFINITELY easier for women. An average man will receive no messages and a handful of responses that usually lead to nothing or being randomly blocked because she changed her mind. A woman will receive thousands of ‚Äúsend nudes‚Äù and ‚Äúdtf?‚Äù Messages but will also receive some or many genuine messages. I‚Äôve hooked up with a decent amount of girls through apps and had genuine relationships and dates. Women have it easier to find a guy who is serious, genuine, and honest. As long as they‚Äôre selective and smart. But the BIG thing about sexuality is that it‚Äôs not equal and people need to come to terms with that. Easier for a man to reproduce and far less complicated to have sex. There‚Äôs benefits and detriments to each group and we‚Äôre not the same and just need to accept that the other has problems and issues that the other can‚Äôt understand, and we also each have certain things easier.

I feel that the vast majority of well-adjusted people greatly undervalue intimacy and have no idea what a total lack of it does to someone's mind. I absolutely understand why incels take part in ""internet self-harm"". By finding people discussing a similar niche issue to theirs, they're confirming that they aren't the only person on the planet experiencing it. It feels good to know that someone ""gets it"".

"So, uh, imma be a bit open about myself here.
I'm a 21 year old guy and I've never had a romantic partner. I've been interested in a lot of girls, and even a guy once, and some people have even been interested in me. But either they haven't been interested in me back or vice versa. It's been rough. I've had so many breakdowns with friends and family as I've felt the crushing feeling of loneliness. It sucks. 
I'm still single. And I still struggle. 

But I'm okay. 

Because I've learned that life is so much bigger than being a sex-magnet Chad. And it's more than just ""go outside and get a hobby."" It's about finding transience within myself, and feeling the connection that all things in our world have with one another. It's the long hours spent drawing or writing stories. It's diving deep into academic interests like science, history, philosophy, and literature. It's about seeking altruism and cooperation in the world, instead of competition and rivalry. It's the realization of how much of our personal lives are illusions of societal expectations and the inner ego, obscuring the truth of reality and what we can do to make it into what we want. It's about taking responsibility for your life and breaking off the toxic branches of your life and growing newer healthy ones in their place.

I could have been an incel. I'm nerdy, my arms are skinny and I gotta bear gut, I'm definately not a Chad, and I'm on the autism spectrum. I could have easily taken both the red and black pill, and maybe for a time I was. But that's not the kind of person I want to be. I want to be a loving son, a grandson, a brother, a friend. I want to help people, in whatever little ways I can. I want to be true to myself and be alive.

I'll keep having bad days. Days where I look back into the abyss and consider embracing it. But mark my word when I say that I will NEVER commit to that thought. Be it an almighty God or an indifferent universe I'm here to stay. And I will live my life.

"It would indeed be accurate to call me an incel, in that I have never been with a women,  and it is not by own choicw. However I've never been part of the community, nor do I subscribe to any hateful or vitriolic veiwpoints. If you at all care I'd share my experience: For me it was never an issue of getting laid, I just wanted to feel loved, I wasn't particularly picky by whom (aside from being heterosexual). I tried dating, I set up about nine dates, six of whom didn't show up, one showed up for a single date and was polite enough to say she wasn't interested, another went on a few dates and decided she'd rather be friends (fair enough, better than stringing me along), the third strung me along, kept me waiting for a few months and then told me to fuck off. I've looked over the texts and replayed the dates in my head, I don't think I ever came across as weird or creepy. 

I'd heard all the typical advice, smarten up (so I started dressing better, shaving, grooming etc.), hit the gym (I now bench 355, squat 495 and deadlift 600 all at 180lbs), be more interesting (I read up on philosophy, started going hillwalking), all to no avail. 
I'm not angry at women, clearly there is something wrong with me, something I can't put my finger on. It my fault, not the fault of women, or the world at large.

To feel totally unloved by the world is a truly horrible feeling, no friends, my family don't bother with me. My situation has bred a very bleak outlook on life, I seriously couldn't care whether or not I become a millionaire or wind up homeless, if I were hit my a car or stircken with illness I genuinely wouldn't care. You could call it the ""Blackpill"" but I've never browsed any website that caters to incels, it a self concieved philosophy.
Literally the only thing that brings me a moment of joy is hitting a PR in the gym, it just makes me feel like the big man, if even for a moment. Then the moment fades, and I'm just the same travesty of a joke of a man. I walk home lower than I ever was. 

Every day just becomes more and more of a struggle to me. What's the point on leaving my bed? I'll never acheive any kind of happiness in this world. I'm just a parasite at this point, consuming resources, housing, oxygen. Day by Day the hope of improvement mlooks more and more distant, every day I sink just a little bit lower.

I don't know why I haven't actually offer myself yet, I think I'm just living in the vein hope that things will improve, then again, I've told myself that lie several times in my life, ""things will be better in high school"" ""things will be better in college"", so why should I belive that I'll fare better in the real world? Not being edgy, not begging for sympathy but I honestly genuinely believe the world would be slightly less shitty if I just cashed out. I think the only real reason I haven't killed myself is because I know even though she rarely talks to me, my mother would be distraught. I think when my brother has a kid she won't be too cut up when I leave.

If anyone happens to have any insults of questions I'd be happy to talk to someone.

"I'm just thankful the Incel community wasn't a well known thing a decade ago when I was one of those angsty young virgins and wasn't mature enough to recognise it's a result of my own issues rather than being the fault of society. It was a really dark period in my life and I dread to think what would have happened if i'd had a bunch of other toxic people reinforcing my views on a daily basis. 
As it happens i'm still a virgin now at 32 as I haven't yet met the right person and i'm not really interested in casual sex, but i've long since realised that my worth as a human being isn't defined by whether i'm in a relationship or not. To all the lonely people out there i'd just like to let you know you don't need a significant other to complete you, you just need to realise that you are already complete in yourself. There are advantages to being in a relationship, but there are major advantages to not being in one too (most notably greater personal freedom) and life can be as rich and joy filled as a singleton as it is as a couple. Happiness isn't something you obtain by achieving arbitrary goals, it's a choice you have the power to make every day by focusing on the blessings you already have rather than the things you don't.",3,0,2018-08-31T10:41:23.000Z

"On what you said about recognizing cruel opinions on your appearance as ‚Äútrue‚Äù:
I think this could be an interesting bias to deconstruct and how this thinking is behind a bunch of erroneous thinking that fail to grasp nuance.  

Maybe depression and anxiety illustrates a hyper-capability to recognize other‚Äôs biases and interests in compliments and well-meaning speech, while insults trigger the amygdales and shuts down the pre-frontal cortex too fast to allow for the same level of critical thinking applied to insults,etc. As a result, a bias would form itself as compliments are being recognized as ‚Äúlies‚Äù-as they biases and interests are (maybe too) quickly associated to a binary view of what is ‚Äútrue‚Äù or ‚Äúnot true‚Äù. Similarly, this unexamined fast association then kicks in, and the unexamined insults are then filtered as ‚Äútrue‚Äù.
If this model of thinking reveals itself to be accurate, a disruption and expansion beyond simplistic black and white thinking + the robust training of critical capacities in more contexts, could help individuals with depression, that are bullied, or that need to overcome their biases.

Or maybe not? Would be interesting to research.",0,0,2018-08-29T18:35:36.000Z

The irony/sarcasm you espouse comes from the old and debunked pseudo-discipline of phrenology and I recognize that, but I think the incel community is using it more as a measure of human attractiveness rather than imbuing it with actual metaphysical meaning.

"Isn't that incel just a consequence of a change of the social fabric?

I have the feeling (as a European living currently in Asia) that this problem is particularly severe in the US where you have: 1. A very structured dating system to an extent it looks like a job interview. 2. There are less and less places to socialize, which is why tinder is the only option... And is toxic as you mention. The main place to socialize is parties, where introverts are definitely not at their advantage 3 geography. Linked to the previous points, in the US all the distances are huge and going out to meet people is a long journey that need a car. I would actually be curious to see a analysis of geographical location of incels, I'm pretty sure that you don't see less of them in big cities. 4 job insecurity doesn't help. Whatever we say, men like to have something to brag about or to define themselves around. There was a time where having a successful carrier (not money wise but from a skill set point of view) was a way to get some self confidence. With all the shitty jobs around, it's hard to find some meaning/pride in a job 5 the social fabric is just loose. There is much less sense of belonging to a community, with all the competition to survive, people are not part of a community. And usually, a community (whatever it is) is the best way to meet possible partners as people within a community already know a bit of something about each other and don't judge only by the size of the skull.

I'm not an incel, and I'm not even a virgin, but sometimes it really does feel like noone will ever love you. Before this past year I had asked people out before, they said no, and I don't resent anyone for it, I never did, it took alot of built-up courage to ask anyone out, but I said fuck it to rejection and did it anyway. And sometimes it feels after being rejected and seeing other happy people (or atleast their best moments on Instagram that makes them seem perfect) it's easy to get lost in the narrative that for no reason at all everybody hates you, or you're unlovable because you're not someone who gets alot of girls, and it's easy to generalise and stereotype all women and all men who have sex with many women under one massive umbrella. I avoided this myself because to me, using minimal critical thought, to be fair,  a universal conspiracy to not fuck me seems far-fetched, there are always prostitutes and stuff anyway. But a loving relationship is what alot of people strive for as part of their life and that's what I wanted. Ultimately what changed for me was that I said to myself that I had to stop saying no to things. I just started doing... well, stuff and I wound up getting drunk, smoking weed, and having sex like a normal-ass teenager/young adult, there's no shortage of people out there, be yourself, thrust yourself into uncomfortable situations and just fucking live your life and you'll find the fulfilment you're looking for.

imagine someone who dont even get enough socal interaction of basic talking.

weve done studies with human isolation with prisons doing solitary confinement, its some of the worst conditions a human can go in. you actually start to degrade the ability to talk in isolation where  if left at months can forget but still relearn how to speak    but if left for years can be almost compleately unable to speak the languige.

"Everything red-pillers say about sex and dating is so thoroughly backed up by science, specifically evolutionary psychology, that there is no real arguing with any of it. The problem a lot of people run into is that they make normative judgments about that data, or think the red-pillers are making normative judgments about that data, and some of them do, but most would say they're just acknowledging a reality. 

The 80/20 rule is real. See Zipf's law and the Pareto principle, as well as the data gathered from dating apps that demonstrates the law and the principle in action, even in, yes, the sexual marketplace, because as you rightly point out, that is essentially what dating is.

Hypergamy is real.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy

It is a legitimately recognized concept within the social sciences, and it is a mating strategy women are genetically soft-wired to practice, because, simply put, if you're born a biological female, once you hit breeding age, you have one opportunity every 9 months to produce viable offspring. You want good genes for your kid, and a mate that will invest in offspring with the hope that said mate will contribute a great deal toward the viability of that offspring even after childbirth. In contrast, the most effective male mating strategy, also soft-wired in, is to try and get as much free pussy as possible, and hope that at least one of the kids is viable. None of this is outside the realm of mainstream evolutionary biology.

There are a lot of things the red pill community is right about that feminists do not want to admit, for varying potential reasons; they don't like what that implies about women (again falling into the trap of naturalist fallacy, or reverse-naturalist fallacy as it were), they don't want men to understand these things, they're worried about optics, or any other number of reasons I could scarce begin to guess at.

What's more, most women have an average of 1-2 children. The average for men is the same, but the actual distribution of children had across both genders looks wildly different. Some men are going to have a lot of kids, some men will have no kids. Most women will have at least one kid. Like with most gender-based bell-curves, averages look pretty equal, but the internal distributions show men at the extremes, and women at the center. The reality is that there are going to be a lot more men than women who simply never experience sex, who will have zero chance to procreate. I think you're right to sympathize with them, but I don't think you go far enough, and here's why; Maslow put sexual physical contact where he did in the hierarchy of needs for a reason. Look at how old people forgotten in nursing homes act around volunteers or nurses; they will reach out and try to touch them, sexually or otherwise. When babies aren't held, they die to a condition simply known as ""failure to thrive."" The fact is, human beings need touch, from other human beings. Or they die. 

Sometimes, usually when the three factors of fatherlessness, severe social ostracization, and autism coalesce, that death is messy and violent enough that they take others with them. Unless we can find a way to treat this kind of suffering, (or expose and rectify some of the glaring injustices perpetrated against men and boys in this society, more often than not by the hands of women, statistically speaking) this is going to keep happening. I've had one person so foolish to suggest that anger management is the kind of treatment necessary to put a stop to this. I don't imagine anger management would do anything for such a person, other than perhaps drive them to suicide faster.

Since you brought up Elliot Rodger, I'd like to point two things out about him; first, in his own words, ""the only thing that matters in this world is female approval."" He said that in the very video you showed a clip of, and in his rampage, he killed more men than women. Incels don't hate women; they hate the fact that they will, in all probability, never be with one. The stuff that looks like hate is nothing more than reaction-formation, and we know it is because we know how they would respond the instant they got propositioned by even a slightly below-average-looking woman.

You can say that the way incels are approaching their problems is only going to hurt them more, and you may very well be right, but society hasn't given them much other choice. Everywhere they go, they get severely socially ostracized, one of those conditions I listed as a correlative factor for people who become mass shooters. So they stick to their private spaces with each other, and sometimes even those get shut down. Society has a history of demonizing men, especially young men, who aren't in some way useful to society, particularly useful to women. These incels are the ones who are going to get the shortest possible end of that fuckstick, and we wonder why mass shootings are almost exclusively a boys club.",4,1,2018-08-27T22:25:07.000Z

"From what I've seen a lot of incels talk about how women only go after ""Chads"" and they never get a chance but that's just the thing. Most if not them want like really hot girlfriends. Like way out if their league. When they don't get her they just spiral into their pill mentality. Hilariously enough they are just as bad as the women they claim to hate so much. They refuse to lower their ridiculous standards and can never get any. They only like those women because of their bodies not because they have any real connections with them.

Thank you for a thoughtful look at this phenomenon. I cant help but feel for them - feelings of rejection and self-loathing are something we all go through, but they are stuck in a death spiral...or angry echo chamber, as the case may be.  On one of the most popular incel message boards, the rules ban: worship or praise (not in the religious sense, just looking up to people), and bragging (any life successes, basically).  Additionally, ""bait"" threads are disallowed, resulting in the fact that any debate that maybe females aren't the root of all their problems can be a bannable offense.  Having a place to blow off steam with other like-minded people can be alluring, but they get stuck in a cycle of negativity where the only acceptable response is one-upmanship of violence or nihilism. They need help, and are stuck somewhere that actively discourages it.",1,2,2018-08-27T03:31:43.000Z

"This is a great video, but I really wish some things that are scientific would addressed as such, instead of just being ridden off as part of the Incel ideology. Like the fact that male and female skulls are different in numerous ways, and the more masculine a skull, the more attractive a man will be percieved in the eyes of women. Sociologists have studied and proven this for decades now, it isn't just based off of anecdotals form incels or their ideology. or ideological. The same goes for the 80/20 rule. Women really do have a higher bar for what they consider attractive, and will actively seek out much higher rated men than their male counterparts will do to them. I know that you're probably intelligent enough to know that this is the case, but crazy lefties who think everything is a social construct, do not, and so it would have been nice if you would have clarified it.",0,4,2018-08-27T00:05:02.000Z

"""The Alpha Fux Beta Bux"" theory made my eyebrows climb so high that for a few moments I had full head of hair again. WOW. I kind of feel bad for people who think that way.
I'd visited an incel website about 10 years ago, a message board, and I hung around there for a while. Before anyone says anything (if they do), I'd never heard of the term before. Anyway, I was a virgin in my late 20s (still am... and I mean virgin, not in my late 20s), and I was looking for people to talk to hoping to deal with the emotional side of that. What I saw was angry, sad people (which I figured), but some of them were hateful towards women, so hateful, and I couldn't understand why. I remember asking ""wouldn't you want to be kind to women? To learn about them as people?""

"Let's be honest: these ""men"" are not well psychologically or emotionally. They are mentally ill. Many have anxiety disorders and have paranoid complexes and borderline disorders. This is no more a ""movement"" than say Schizophrenia is ""lifestyle choice."" These ""incels"" are like the female sufferers of bulimia nervosa, who hold themselves often to an impossible ""feminine"" standard of beauty that most super models would fail at achieving. Likewise, these males hold themselves up against a very unrealistic false model of masculinity that the most virile man with stereotypical masculine attributes would fail at achieving. It's a sad, distorted, false view of reality. That said, the MGTOW ""movement"" does touch on some truths, but as a whole its members are the masculine equivalent of third-wave feminists with sexist ideologies that they then project on all women. It's stupid and ultimately self-defeating for the individual man let alone men and women of society. Most men are like most women: they want to be loved‚Äîand want to love. Like women, they want to enjoy their expression of their gender and be in genuine emotionally-invested relationships. For women to be surprised of this speaks of their naive understanding of men; and for men to deny this speak of their immature development or resentful need for this human condition. And however real and not to be ignored gender difference are at the end of the day, they are negligible and moot points in the consideration of want of love and companionship. We need to have compassion for these young men that think and feel this way and call it what it is: an illness of mind and spirit.",0,1,2018-08-26T21:17:42.000Z

"Dear Natalie,

I loved this video.  Keep up the incredible work and thank you for exploring the difficult and frankly traumatizing word of the far right to bring us ideas on how to interact constructively.

I would love to see your thoughts on the overall trends and cultural developments have led to the kind of alienation and self harm you observe in the incel forums.  Do you believe that we are in a distinctly alienated time?  A sort of hyper-exaggerated version of Giacometti's vision of modern humans?  Or is the alienation in our society reasonably static, but our perspective of it changed?  Or perhaps neither and we are simply focused on the now and ignoring the continuity with the past?

Thanks again,

Your fan.",1,0,2018-08-26T16:27:07.000Z
"Inviting incels to hate-watch this is a public service. Natalie IS a gorgeous goddess and I know the ""hon"" explanation is illustrative, not fishing for compliments. It doesn't need to be said that Natalie's piano-playing wrists are v elegant.

Debating incel points or ""solving"" incel problems is condescending and counterproductive. It's not going to treat the underlying alienation that criticism of unfettered capitalism might.

We make our own enemies, we make people into our enemies and those people vilify us because they did nothing wrong but we hate them anyway. We're human beings, we want to listen when people say we're right and we want to run when somebody tells us we're wrong. The more bitter we become the less likeable we are, so we're more lonely and more bitter; it's a spiral that keeps going down untill it reaches all the way to where your spirit used to be and suddenly you don't even care.

"Long post:

It's not their involuntary celibacy that makes them toxic people and you can bet they would abuse any woman they got with.  These men advocate for FGM and the forced sexual enslavement of women.  They do not deserve to be anywhere near a woman and the fact that they go around killing people (mostly women) as some sort of revenge is basically turned into a hostage situation when someone so much as implies that them finding a partner would make them better.  The fact that they talk about all the suicide stuff while complaining about women not sleeping with them is a red flag, implying the women are the reason for their suicide.  Surely you can't be so lacking in foresight and common sense that you wouldn't expect emotional blackmail through suicide threats, especially come breakup time if their partner has any sense?

Listen, there are so many people, many of whom are women but surely including a few men as well, who are sexually frustrated and you don't see them creating a community dedicated to dehumanizing those who won't have sex with them or mass advocating for anyone else to be mutilated or enslaved.  So no, they don't deserve your pity and you're sending a bad message when you sympathize with this vile subculture of men, as opposed to people who actually seek community support for their frustration.

That said, I did find your bit about digital self-harm to be interesting.  Online positivity culture, such as 'hon' (so that's where that shit's from...) culture, for example, is insincere to the point of gaslighting and the trans community has way too much of that.  I felt that with my high-pitched little boy voice, large breasts, and feminine eye shape, people were only referring to me as a man out of some kind of obligation or fear and not because they actually recognized me as one.  Of course the truth is going to be a breath of fresh air compared to that, but finally being able to say, ""Fuck it!"" and refusing to conform to any form of gender was truly a weight off my shoulders.  Maybe Mr. Bread Scientist wouldn't have been such an insecure, horrible, rapey piece of shit if he weren't so dedicated to masculinity.

As for any analogous experience with digital self-harm, when I was more dysphoric I would often find myself looking up material that confirmed my biological inferiority as someone who is female.  Never, by the way, not even when I was explicitly looking for it, did I find anything that contradicted my conviction that female bodies are biologically inferior, so this made me even more hopeless and dysphoric.  Nobody could prove me wrong, either.",25,12,2018-08-26T15:48:25.000Z

""The nonassertive, unaggressive little boy will commonly develop non-masculine interest patterns.

For example, he will prefer quiet, non-physical forms of play; working with arts and crafts, music and theatre arts, dolls and figurines, etc., all of which relate in different ways to violation of gender role expectation.""

"I don't think their claims about physical attractiveness are unsubstantiated. A lot of these guys are average looking as you've said, but the other issue is that personality isn't and end-all be-all for women. There are a multitude of factors in play in regards to relationship dynamics, and physical attractiveness is a primary interest motive. If you ask me, personality and interests are secondary factors that maintain the relationship and contribute to compatibility. The suggestion is also that these men have to look like renaissance sculptures to be attractive. It's an absolute exaggeration of what is typically considered an attractive male. It's also an indicator that such men are reliant on the satisfaction of psychosexual factors which are typically secondary to personal achievements of success. A relationship is not a primary mode of living. It's a benefit. This strange obsession with women is also even more concerning.

"For anyone seeking to understand people, it's important to look at the good, but also the bad.

This is an excellently done video. It's like gazing into an abyss. A sea of despair. Does that sound dramatic? This whole situation is rather dramatic, so I think it fits. I knew of Incels and what their major malfunction was, and it turns out I wasn't wrong, but the extent. The extreme level. The beliefs, the way they talk, suicidal worship, I just can't believe it. There is a part of my human soul and civilized instincts that insist that a real, actual group of fellow human beings surely cannot be like this.

Only straw men constructs of a position and Saturday morning cartoon villains are ever that evil.

But they are.

It's *that* nuts.

I always saw the Chad and Virgin image and thought, if it was ever a real thing and not some mockery, it was just people saying 'we're Chads and great'. I had no clue that it was really a self-loathing hate-ideology trying to explain their own 'inferiority' and lack of success, how they feel they're doomed, despair for the future. It hurts because I see some of myself in there. The lack of hope for the future. But the way they turn that kind of dread or despair or rejection into some kind of Eternal Law instead of, you know, how things just worked out is obscene.

And how they 'cope' with those feelings by hurting their fellow human beings, with hateful ideology no more legitimate or reasonable than Jew hating or garden-variety racism or sexism or any of that, is intolerable. That's where they cross from pitiful creatures to dangerous things.

It's like I'm looking at the actual, real life version of the Despair ideology from Danganronpa.

Except adherents to it, while self-destructive, violent, bad people, didn't feel obligated to be miserable. Hell, you get the impression they quite enjoy all the fucked up stuff, and find happiness in it.

*This is madness.* 

Whatever perspective can be brought to this, or shades, or details, that is the truth at the core of this whole subject. The whole Incel thing is fucking insanity. It's anathema to humanity.

It is also, thankfully, a very, very, very small group, compared to everyone everywhere. And with an ideology like that, hateful tactics and self-loathing, it's not likely to change anytime soon. At least there's some mercy in that.

Also, by the way, you're a better person imo than your opposition, because you actually go out of your way to understand their position, give them credit where it seems due, etc. As it goes, 'when the Left wants to understand the Right, they see what the Right is saying. When the Right wants to understand the Left, they see what the Right is saying'.

Also x2, about the 'infection' thing, about going into these horrible spaces and being changed by them, gazing into that abyss as it gazes into you, I know that feeling well. I am a big nerd, I go into spaces like pro wrestling fandom, anime, video games, fictional stuff, and holy fucking shit, is there a prevalent, well. There's a lot of prevalent things there. And even though I do not agree with the Right about nearly anything, just seeing so many times people disgusted by the idea of feminism, or annoyed with bringing up Oppression, started to make me resonate and have the same reactions on an emotional level. I am annoyed by fellow liberals, despite completely being in agreement with what they actually say. Or at least, that's a reaction I have occasionally.

And it's fucking horrible. I want this perspective out of my brain, I want to scrub it clean of this 'feminists are taking over muh video games' shit. I guess the first step is recognizing there's a problem.",0,0,2018-08-25T20:29:53.000Z

Critical seems more honest, but it also feels more intimate. It's socially acceptable to praise people you don't know very well, and if you don't feel like you have a satisfying amount of human connection in your life, it can be seriously addictive to be provided with a community that gives you feelings of intimacy. This will increase the pressure to fit in with this community, so its members are going to be very likely to accept the ideas that seem to be a consensus without question.",0,0,2018-08-25T07:57:40.000Z

In fact, they probably wouldn‚Äôt even care about being ugly if they felt like women were still going to fuck them. That‚Äôs literally the extent of their insecurity.

"I totally understand what you mean by picking up the lingo of a group and then having natural thoughts that would come from that group (like what you mentioned/joked wrt briefly thinking ""that Chad is totally heighblocking"").  'Cuz even when it's not fuelled by some small reality turned into a catastrophe in my mind, I've found myself reading through nasty blogs and such, to Learn About The People (similar to what you've done here), and found myself totally starting to think their core beliefs about myself, automatically.  Ex; I used to read through pro-ana/pro-mia/thinspo etc., blogs so that I could help people coming to me for advice on how to accept themselves for their current weight.  

I thought it would help me understand their headspace, and then help me deconstruct that for them instead of just giving them the usual body positive quotes, because while those quotes are often true, they don't feel honest to many people with eating disorders.  

I'm thin, and I've been thin for most of my life, and my weight has never, ever concerned me, but after obsessively reading through these blogs (they became an addiction), I started to think I was objectively fat without a thigh gap, I started to think that it was good when I wasn't eating (when I'd have a cig instead), and good that my meds take away my appetite.  I never got to the point where I ever thought this stuff about other people's bodies and lifestyles, but I can imagine how, if I'd stayed on those blogs, they could have permeated my consciousness enough to really fuck me right up and turn me into a monster, as you said here in the part about TTTT.  

These ways of thinking and these online cults seem like they'd be obviously wrong and obviously easy to not think in line with, partly because they're so absurd-sounding to an outsider or someone without those insecurities.  But they are still, somehow, alluring.  Regardless of personal reality.  So these sorts of groups -- incels right at the top there -- can convince people that they're unlovable simply by existing and being accessible with the  click of a cursor.  For people who already have these insecurities, these sites/groups are an utter, life-consuming disaster.

The block function is key.  Thank you so much for bringing it up, and for saying it (and linking it) to the people who look up to you, like myself.",8,0,2018-08-24T22:18:14.000Z

"That tendency to seek out what hurts us is so true. I'm black, and I started browsing some racist forums, just out of morbid curiosity, and a desire to see just how deep their delusions went. But eventually I started noticing the skin tone of criminals before their crime, I felt unreasonably disappointed in my own race, and I started giving credence to those bullshit statistics, it was a slippery slope. This was ridiculous, I'm black, I live with black people, I interact with black people everyday, I should know better than any racist trapped in their bubble bubble of bigotry that a black person is just like any other normal person. Whether they're smart, dumb, hardworking, lazy, kind, or shitty, it has nothing to do with race. So why was I slowly starting to think that I was somehow inferior for having more melanin? These thoughts were way unhealthy, and, fun to laugh at or not, I couldn't keep giving those racists my attention anymore. 
It's funny, if a racist came across a forum bashing racists, they'd just double down on their racism, not start doubting themselves. Why is hate so much easier to nurture than confidence and optimism?",691,35,2018-08-24T18:57:18.000Z

Dont be a nice guy become indifferent to women and recognize your superiority, that's something that requires practice. Not only do you have to know it, you gotta truly believe it in your heart. It makes it so you will become immune to female f**kery. When women become emotional show them utter indifference, nothing they do can break your calm.

"Skulls actually do matter, just not quite in terms of ""metaphysical"" significance. For example, larger lower jaws is a physiological indicator of testosterone exposure, and is correlated with behavioral traits associated with such exposure. Likewise, facial width to height ratio is strongly linked with politcal preference, social dominance (it's linked with social dominance in both humans and capuchin monkeys) and racism. 

One of many examples:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915005759

Also, skull size actually is a reliable predictor of IQ at around .4, based on a meta-analysis of several hundred studies of the link between IQ and intracranial volume -- that is, when controlling for sex and body size. So these things do matter to a significant degree, but not having a large lower jaw doesn't mean you can't get laid, like incels think. They're just lazy, whiny twirps.",0,0,2018-08-24T17:14:00.000Z
"Hmm... This seems totally related to ""Everything wrong with (Ganja Burn by Niki Minaj) which, I couldn't finish. (Don't care for the everything wrong with, but I'm bored.) Incels, huh? Well, but labeling yourself something like that is certainly a way to make sure you'll never... Looks aren't everything. I've met some guys with girlfriends that made me jealous of them, and I don't mean just looks. Smart and strong as well, which I find more attractive. I ended up in a gaslit relationship with someone that was considered (incredibly hot) and that hotness that I saw at the beginning quickly faded away into a horrible pig monster. I don't know why I saw a pig in her face, but most guys would say ""How did you get a woman like that?"" and I'd respond ""Take her! I don't want her! She won't leave or admit to anything she does!"" But that same thing works the other way too. Someone with a great personality starts looking attractive too! Unless... That just happens to me, in which case. That sucks. 

Oh, and I'm not the type of guy that would be considered beta or alpha or whatever they call guys who seem to get women by looks alone. Oh, and money too. If you need money to attract someone, you're going to attract someone who'll take all your money. Thankfully my ex-wife gets all my money still so I've never had the chance to use money to impress someone. Instead I impress with my awesome being poor skillz. :P (My ex was super rich compared to myself and she was actually very impressed with how frugal I could be and she never knew things could be so cheap. I never knew someone would be willing to pay so much to live in a certain area like that. Basically a 1 square mile suburb right next to what's considered a ""bad"" area. I wouldn't call it bad, just a bit more diverse. I loved it there. I had a giant asian supermarket in walking distance. 

       I'm currently in a small town in a farming community next to an Amish community. Lately it's been pretty crappy around here. In terms of how people are starting to act. I'm certainly in a town full of trump supporters. It's a bit scary to speak my mind and my Mom and I are Native  and I didn't realize our skin tone until recently now that some people let me know we're not welcome here. We had the police over a few times over B.S. last week, the third being over a license for my mother's dog. (I take care of her, and her dog's 16). She forgot to get a license, but the cop said he's just doing his job and knocking on every door. Yet he left the apartment building after only knocking on our door and when I ran out back to see where he went next, he went straight down the road out of town. So, somehow we ended up being the very last of everybody in the town he had to knock on doors. We didn't have the money to get it in the 2 days before he came back with a fine for my mom. I tried going to city hall but they wanted vet papers which I didn't know about. I got what I could but they wanted the one on his rabies shot. Which he's at the age where it can be fatal. I pointed that out to city hall and they went can said that they called the vet and that the elderly dog's only 10 years old and has never had a rabies shot. I asked where this vet was, and they said a town an hour in the opposite direction than where she goes. So I took a gamble and wrote ""Look, I know we are not welcome here. The neighbors and community's made that pretty clear. You don't need to be sending the police over to constantly harass us!"" I'll admit the first time the police showed up last week was after being told to go back to my own country at a bar concert I was just at because it was so loud it was keeping me up. That pissed me off so I came home and complained about how shitty things have been getting around here. I had recently had a breakdown from a friend dying and having the same racist neighbor that's threatening to call the  cops on us for whatever she can find a reason for. (We don't park near the apartment because she has called the police on a dark girl from Puerto Rico and an old woman she hated while they lived here. The Puerto Rican girl moved out in tears after leaving her apartment for 2 months. According to this neighbor (she just left and didn't pay rent or anything) but she paid rent and just didn't stay there and didn't come back until I think she found a place to live. But with how she seemed to be treated, and she didn't know english either to make things harder, I was nearly certain she left because of the community. Well, the racist neighbor first revealed her racism to me at that moment by coming up to and displaying her glee at ""the darky"" leaving. I turned and said ""You know, I'm darky too in a way."".  I feel terrible about it because I think I heard her say ""Adios Amigos"" to me, but by the time I realized what she said and that it was probably to me I was already inside and could hear her crying pretty hard. I'm pretty sure I'm the only neighbor to try to say Hi in a friendly way and would wave when I saw her. 
         I had the breakdown and tried to take my own life after finding my neighbor/friend's body. He had mental issues and after talking to the police for like an hour I was heading back to my apartment. She was outside her apartment which was right across from me. She laughed and said basically ""Haha, I heard the retard's dead!"" and I lost it completely. It was like someone gave me a ton of Xanax or something. I don't remember the day except that everyone thought I was on something. (I wasn't until later and then I was so out of it I took a bottle full of the wrong pills. But I snapped out of it shortly after, remembering what I had just done I called 911 on myself. But I think maybe my last message and the fact that I was released from the hospital about a month ago and days before the cops came to bother us about the tiny dog that never goes outside. But it may have helped that the police think I'm on the verge of suicide and they realized they were harassing me. And from what I could tell, nobody else was there to pay dog licenses or whatever and several people with dogs still have never had the police show up about not getting a license. 

Sorry, all that was off topic. But kind of not. I think it's all part of the same problem. And incredible amount of ignorance along with the unwillingness to change. Yet, people are changing and just don't realize it. Being made new in a way that's much more of a regression. Thankfully not the entire community is so bad. At the moment though, I have 2 tenants in the building making life here not so easy. I did run into the newest tenant the other day and she asked me why everyone in the building hates her. I knew the same woman I had a problem with was doing stuff to mess with her. But I guess she told her crazy stories about how everyone in the building hates her and how she needs to watch out for me and her other next door neighbor. That she should keep her door locked at all times because we will.. do something. I don't know what. I knew she's been saying something nuts though. Oh, and I was figuring the neighbor stayed up all night to avoid everyone. (I sometimes have to search for my cat outside and noticed her light on every night.) Well, I was right. The neighbor had her thinking that everyone hated her and that a lot of people in the building are dangerous. But except for the two tenants. The rest of us in the building keep to ourselves and get along. 

Oh, and instead of any kind of empathy about my hospitalization or even the fact that she ended up knocking on the door the day I got out to complain about a health worker that stopped by while nobody was home and she had to have been in our apartment because she commented about the state of a few things she had to have seen to comment on. And yeah, with my Mom in her condition and me in the hospital so long, things got bad. But I was on these mood stabalizers that did the opposite and made me have to tell whoever was making me upset, that they are making me upset only it would come out as a scream. And I screamed that none of that is any of her business and why is she knocking on our door to tell us that anyway and then that it's that type of B.S. that made me try to kill myself. All she had to say was that they should have kept me longer. After the first 72 hours (which because of state lines and etc... took a full week to be over with. Weekends didn't count for one, neither my stay at the regular hospital for the day and a half before a bed opened up. They had me very sedated at that point, which is the best way to find yourself in a hosptial like that by the way. I showed up along with almost everyone in my ward and apparently I was a riot that first day I was there and told everyone my game plan, which was to embrace whatever's going to happen until I can get home. The staff kept pointing out to us that they never had a group that got along and were as open as we were. Which was nice to hear. And I ended up being thanked for stuff I said on my first day, when I was sedated and can't remember any of. Which is why being sedated like that was great. I woke up and realized I wasn't at home, figured I tried to do something to myself. Walked out to face the music and meet whoever and made everyone laugh by introducing myself on my second day. The only thing that sucked is every story I wanted to share I had already shared that first day. I apparently told everyone all about myself already. So the hard part of getting people to accept me was already over with by the time I woke up and realized where I was and etc... (Not geographically. I was pretty surprised to find they had to ship me out of state. A lot of people are dying to get into the hospital lately. So much so, that there's not enough beds for all the people. And if you're feeling lonely, know there's a hospital full of people who all tried to do the same thing I did. We all wanted to end it all and ended up there.",0,1,2018-08-24T16:50:59.000Z

"The reason incels believe women are difficult in any way is to my theory because throughout history men labored to provide for thier families. Then in modern history today women have equal rights to men and they don't take responsibility and consideration possibly for a household,  disregarding men as being of value unless there is attraction prehaps. An obese,entitled, unattractive hetrosexual female with no job, money and is uneducated can post that she's single and get thousands of hetrosexual males pursuing her as fast as a compliment can be sent but a poor, obese, unattractive hetrosexual male without a job, money and possibly uneducated and entitled or not posts he is single, in most cases gets 0 responses from any hetrosexual women. Where is the equality and keep in mind this is all theoretical to my knowledge but why are hetrosexual women not educated to pursue hetrosexual men fervently as hetrosexual men will any woman by nature? I believe by theory it's testosterone not being produced in heterosexual females from lack of physical exercise to ignite desperate attraction to unattractive hetrosexual male's. Now rather a person is hetrosexual or not shouldn't create a barrier for anyone being pursued if they desire to be, is my belief but it seems unbalanced until society becomes properly educated as a whole throughout humanity according to my theory.",1,1,2018-08-24T07:13:21.000Z
Girl your honesty in this video is awesome! Subscribing!,2,0,2018-08-24T07:06:43.000Z
"I'm not entirely sure what life circumstances lead me to this video at 2 AM ish and now writing this comment at 230am ish.

I will say, I don't identify as an incel, though I am sexless and a straight white male. I did find the red pill, and to be honest much of the red pill is accurate enough and the idea of hidden truths is very accurate. One of the biggest takeaways I got from the red pill is, that the two sexes are different and that women don't want nice quiet guys. A fact that can very easily be observed. In general, it got me to seriously learn about the two sexes. And for that i will forever be grateful.

That said, MGTOW and the blackpill and simply using women to spin 10000 plates endlessly while decrying sluthood and feminism(though i do agree feminism today is especially toxic) as the things that are ruining the world, while yourself being a man slut is a bit of a delusional hypocritical point of view.

black bill and MGTOW is accurately summarized. lay down and rot. I find these mindsets particularly toxic and the antithesis of what drew me to the red pill in the first place which was ""why do I suck with women"". You know pondering why was I failing? Even then I didn't go into the incel world, and what I had seen of it was purely toxic self hating insanity to such a level that I could not fathom even in my warped state of mind.

I would somehow eventually discover circumcision, and become obessed with it. It was a rape and mutilation and it's discovery gave me horrible flashbacks of my own infant rape and mutilation(and no I am not interested in anyone telling me it's a good thing, you are wrong, I could prove it with ease, but I'm not getting into that fight here....just know that you are wrong utterly and totally).

you see, for as long as I have known, I have always had trouble bonding with people, I could never figure it out. It was instinctive honestly. I can't stand loving feelings and emotions being given to me. It always made me freeze up and be awkward. I also always had unexplainable rage towards my parents.

I finally came to peace with all of that and that is when I discovered said circumcision and became filled with rage. I became obsessed, i learned every possible conceivable fact about it. Which is why there is nothing you could say to convince me that it is a healthy and harmless act as I simply know more about it than you do. This also added to my misery and hating, because I know what I know, I know sex, simply cannot be half of what it should be since I am missing half my dick thanks to pedophiles masquerading as doctors. And so I continued to justify that I am destined to be alone or that I will work on getting a relationship later or any other number of things. That said, that produced a sick mind. The bible has a fun quote for that, and who knows if it said else where but:

18 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.

I think this is pretty accurate statement here. The red pill, black pill, and even the aforementioned circumcision gave me much truth, even if it isn't all accurate it did make me miserable. It turned me back towards and fully into a self hating bastard.

But all these facts, all this knowledge on the sexes, the red pill, circumcision, black pill, MGTOW, and even racial awareness. While these facts may actually be accurate, and I could argue them quite well, your last bit of the video is what really stings and where you make your best point.:

When you talk about the black pill being suicide fuel, this is exactly right. When you become obsessed with reading negative comments about yourself because they cut to the core of who you are and the comparison to cutting yourself(something I did the way distant past). This seems accurate because I think the toxic communities we are drawn to are parts of ourselves that we naturally like, so in this case, learning about the sexes to get laid, but because the internet creates echo chambers of toxic BS, what starts out as normal learning quickly spirals. Incels and MGTOW being the end result of this particular rabbit hole.

you say:

""Im not going to respond to your world view like its an intellectual position worthy of debate because you're not using them the way rational people use arguments. your using them as razorblades to abuse yourselves""

And that is where you win and where this video really hit me. The rest after that is just gravy. So yes, while I feel confident I could win an argument in any of the above mentioned topics in my sob story, I think I would lose precisely because I am using them as a razor blade of self abuse, to keep going down that death spiral and forming mental habits that will make it impossible for me to be happy. 

Today my internet personality must die. I officially kill it. 

I recently turned 34 and kept swearing myself I will not carry bullshit with me into my 34th year....yet I couldn't keep that promise to myself but a few hours. I have to and will keep that promise.

"Incels are pathetic primarily because they make ""having a relationship with a woman"" the highest good, and essentially conclude that life without this is worthless.  Ironically, this attitude is extremely repellent to women.  The most alpha thing a man can do is become volcel:  to disregard women entirely (monk style).  Just below this is a man with a healthy marriage and a family.  The ""Chads"" who bang lots of sluts (especially PUA types) are far below this, and are only just above incels.  They are pathetic for precisely the same reason:  they spend an inordinate amount of time on pursuing sex, which is a very small part of life, and is essentially useless outside the context of marriage and reproduction.

That said, I find a lot of their content hilarious.  Posts about being a ""chincel"" (weak chin) or ""forearmcel"" (small forearms), etc.  Most of it is much more light-hearted than the media portrays.  The r/Braincels community is particularly funny.",4,0,2018-08-24T04:14:55.000Z

"I really love this video.  I feel like I've been screaming these things to my depressed friends, my lonely male friends, but especially at myself.  And it's hard to take yourself seriously and take your own advice.  But hearing them from you, another human- it really helps.  Thank you.
I hope you read this comment.  Because- I clicked on this video randomly, as it was in my sidebar.  I've never heard of you or seen any of your videos before, so I had no idea you were a trans-woman.  I'm not very politically correct, and this honest to god isn't an ""everyone is beautiful"" comment.  When you said you used to live as a man, I thought maybe you meant, you were a biological female who thought she was trans-male for a time, lived as a man, then decided that she was truly a female and went back to their biological sex.  A few moments later I realized you were a trans-woman.  You look entirely female and honestly, I think a facial feminization surgery would be a waste of money.  From the point of view of a complete stranger, I had no inclination to think you were a trans-woman.  And I personally have a lot of trans friends, so it's not like the concept of someone being trans is foreign to me.  My only thought of your appearance was that your make-up is on point.  And my only negative thought of your appearance is that your upper lip looks a little overdrawn.  Lol.  Anyway, I hope you read this comment, as it is what I honestly thought.

"I mean, this is all pretty accurate but you're not actually refuting any of their points. Yes it is true that many guys will never get a meaningful relationship with a woman, just like it's true that lots of trans will never pass and would be better off not transitioning. And in fact there is a lot of overlap between the two, incels who end up believing they might find love if they become the girlfriend. Because that's where the end of the video gets it completely wrong, it's not about just eroticism, every incel knows how to fap. It's about love and intimacy. It's the loneliness of having no one who will ever like you enough to want to do any of those things with you.

"The reason we go seeking negative things about ourselves is because we have an innate nagging doubt when anyone who tells us good things about ourselves; that can't be true, we think, so they must be lying. We can't quite let ourselves believe it, so if we just go looking, then surely we can find the ""real truth"" about ourselves. We go and find the views that match the most negative views that we're seeking to confirm, & therefore, these will be the only views which we don't write off as lies. Of course, if you ask 100 people to rate you on your looks, and all 100 rate honestly, then some people will think you look good, some won't. That's called personal taste. What we effectively do when we behave like this is go after the worst 2 or 3 viewpoints from those 100 people and take that as the ""honest view"" - those other 98 people must be lying, we say, or, they're just being kind. 

I was lucky to grow up without Reddit and way before the incel thing - looking at it now, I am terrified of what would have happened to me had I done so, because I grew up convinced I was ugly & I can see how the incels model the world would really have appealed to my insecurities. Reality is i'm just a pretty normal looking dude but even now in my mid 30s I can occasionally have a feeling that i'm butt ugly, no women want me, and anyone who disagrees must be lying. Usually when i'm ill and feeling low. The thing is, objectively, I can refer to experiences that should blow my own negative thoughts about myself out of the water (& probably classify me as a 'chad' in incel eyes). I've slept with utterly beautiful women, I've seduced on first dates, I've been told that I look like a greek statue, & much more. But it's so easy to fall into believing my worst thoughts about myself, because despite everything I've experienced, the little voice in my head is still trying to convince me to see only the worst. Knowing my own headspace, I can see how I might have become an incel in my early 20s if i'd been exposed to it.

There's really no big secrets to overcoming these things; it's about finding ways to cope with your anxieties. Relationships of any kind are as simple as this; the more energy you spend focusing inwards on your self, the less energy you have to give outwards to other people. Nobody wants to be around an energy suck. If you're busy being anxious and neurotic inwards, what do you have to offer outwards? Men: Simply think of women who are self obsessed - it's not attractive, right? Well, you're effectively doing the same thing. Need an analogy? Think of your inner state like a garden (inner world) nestled in the countryside (outside world). You want to go off and explore the countryside and see what's out there, because it's beautiful and wondrous. If everything is in order in your garden, the flowerbeds are kept, the lawn is mown, then you're going to be able to go out and wander around the woods and along the streams. You'll enjoy the beauty without ever having to turn a thought or worry for the state of your garden, because you know you've got that shit locked down. You are free to enjoy the moment that you're in. But if on the other hand your garden is overgrown and desperately in need of maintenance, there's junk on the lawn and weeds everywhere, then you still might want to escape into the countryside to get away from it, but the reality is that you're not going to enjoy the beauty around you so much - you're going to be distracted thinking about the mess back home. This is more or less what you're doing when you go out seeking a woman to solve the fact that your inner world is a mess (eg lots of negative self talk and anxiety). You're trying to get validation from the external world, to make up for your lack of self validation from the internal. But of course you don't succeed because you can't really be present - you're too wrapped up in yourself, & anyway, you're trying to take (to get validation) and not give. It's also why both men and women love confident people - because when someone is confident, they're not looking inwards all the time, they're not trying to take from you, they're able to actually be present with you, listen to what you are saying, and try to understand you (rather than being too wrapped up in their own shit).

The good news is that you can make it a continuous conscious decision to get your inner world in order & focus your energy outwards. You can actually make it a habit. Any time you find yourself turning thoughts inwards with negative self talk, you can shut it down and *literally tell youself* to redirect your energy. One final thing: it really made a difference to my mental state when I was a young ""proto-incel"" to start listening to philosophy - Alan Watts is a really good place to start. I found that incredibly useful, particularly in realising that to even fret about what other people think about how I look is to seek validation from external sources that I don't really need.

Very interesting to see how the perspective changed and how obsessed people are with skulls.

I never really understood why people took advice from places like braincels,  other than the Sui fuel on there there's also a bunch of wizards and soon to be wizards giving younger incels advice on how to live their lives, that's actually why I stopped going on those websites, like dude if you have all the answers why are you still here. I really wish a lot of incels would stop going there for advice.
I also like how you pointed out the fact  that most incels are normal looking and it's all in their head, that's something that took me a while to figure out, when I saw guys less attractive and way smaller than me having attractive girlfriends it really made me rethink the whole incel philosophy and approach to being in a relationship.

What redpill says is absolutely true and this are the major points:
Women are obsessed with looks (aka skull shape), or alternatively with money and status
Women can have a simple access to the sexual market regardless their look
Only a 20% of man can have a simplified access to the sextual market, other one can only hope in a long term relationship and act as Beta Provider.
Ugly men are excluded from the sexual market unless they are rich or famous
Jaw shape is the most indicator of fertility in males. Jaw is what make the man
Beauty generate a bias also know as Halo Effect. So, Chads are preferred both for their superior genetic, and for the Halo Effected generated by their look. They are perceived as dominant, and in nature females goes for the alpha male.

"This is the first video I ever saw from you, and I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed watching. 
In a few months I'll be finishing my med school and I have been working with mental health these past year and want to continue working on the field. With that said I don't want to sound an authority or anything, just want to complement that this video is really well made in that area. 

It's important to remind people that we should criticize behavior like this, but we can't forget that they are people too, they have their own suffering and their own quality. The thing I dislike most is when people just bash on others with criticism but forget to at least offer an solution or some glimpse of hope. 

One thing I would like to add, about this behavior of self loathing. People when facing situations that causes stress have multiples ways to deal with negative emotions, these are defenses mechanism that tries to defend our psyche from collapsing. Those mechanism can manifest as primitive for such as negativism (just saying that the bad thing isn't real) or take more elaborate forms.

One really common form of defense is the rationalization, when facing a stress situation, in the case of Incels not getting late, that person tries to find rational reason to why that is happening, even if that is harmful, his Ego is protected from the stress of the situation by hiding behind a false rationalization of that problem. And our psyche will look for anything that will validate that belief, its much more easy for our Ego to accept that the Incel not getting laid because of his skull structure than to accept the harsh reality that, there isn't one single reason, there are a lot of different factors that a single individual can be experiencing to end up making him lonely.

"I've always believed incels to be the most classic case of projection.  They have this delusional idea of what women want based on what they want themselves.  The more I like a person the more attractive they become to me, and the more I dislike them the less attractive they become.  I have met a man and thought ""wow, so beautiful I can't even speak"" then after getting to know him I wondered what I ever saw in him.  Alternately I've met man and thought, aww he's so sweet, too bad he's not cuter, then weeks later was wondering why I didn't see all these attractive qualities I missed before.  Not just men either, the same applies to women and friendships.  They just need to learn to stop judging based on appearance because they can't take the judgement themselves.  People in glass houses and all that.",88,26,2018-08-22T19:28:45.000Z

"3rd Wave Fem single mothers are everything wrong with what society has become, that and their believe they have the right to murder a man's seed, an innocent baby. They are teaching men that masculinity is bad, teaching boys that physical labor and dangerous jobs are bad. Construction employment is down 30% since 2006. Because 3rd wave fem libtards have invited in slave workers to undercut their pay. Citizens could make 25 bucks an hour in the 80s and 90s doing construction. Today, they make about 15 bucks an hour, despite massive inflation. At least you can pay non-citizens 5 dollars an hour to build everything and fix everything, while women occupy the buildings men built. Women pay themselves 100k a year to vlog and write crappy articles that the world could live without. Men do 99% of physical labor, dangerous jobs in harsh conditions. Enjoy buying 20 pairs of shoes, 20 handbags, a ton of fake up and so on, while sitting in a comfy computer chair in heating and air. Don't worry, phone up an illegal and underpay them to fix it for you. Men are done with socialism, and are done doing anything for women. The more sissy boys single feminists pump out, the more you're going to pay mechanics, plumbers, electricians, construction workers etc. Hope you like paying 800 dollars an hour. With limited people to fix your crap, they will be in high demand and they'll work for the highest bidders. While they're working for the highest bidders, no longer protecting women, all the 3rd world immigrants libtards invited in will be raping and murdering them.

"I guess I fall into this category except that I really DON'T hate women. I've never blamed them for my sorry state. I don't like the extremist view that all women are either thots or queens. There will always be good and bad women, just like with men. The problem is on my side, though. I DO get ridiculously anxious with women and my self-esteem literally becomes non-existent the moment anybody (specially women) puts doubts in my head (granted, most of the time I put those doubts in myself).

I guess the reaction to this horrifyingly hopless way of life is either suicidal (e.g. the depressed guys contemplating suicide) or homicidal (e.g. elliot rodger). I truly resent the homicidal ones, i.e. those that feel like women ""owe"" them something (mainly sex and love), which they obviously don't. However, I can't say it's nice to be on the suicidal side either.

I find modern society to be extremely hypocritical.
On the one hand you often hear how important sex is to mental health, how much you need it in your life, and how you'll end up a depressed weirdo when you're 50 without it. (Actual quote from someone)
But on the other hand a lot of people treat you like human waste if you can't get a girlfriend and they tell you that you aren't entitled to sex, but also demonize things like sex dolls that (might) be able to help with some of the supposed mental problems.
Personally, I don't really believe men go nuts if they can't find someone to stick their D into. I think men can go nuts due to the above mentioned double standard.

Hopefully this is just a weird phase where we are going from being very traditional as a society to a more open one where each of us can choose their own path without always being judged for being who we want to be.",5,4,2018-08-22T14:21:11.000Z

"I literally hate to make public comments, but I feel compelled.  Somehow this was suggested from watching an old Death Grips music video, then I got hooked.
This video is definitely the best commentary I've ever seen on the phenomenon of the internet incel community(ies) and its worldview.  Particularly because, as reprehensible as the ultimate conclusion of this worldview is, it is important to remember that such communities are populated by people and no one (or at least *extremely* few) come to such vile conclusions because they're inherently flawed or evil.  Rather, it's a trail of breadcrumbs, where each crumb is a nugget of delicious self-loathing and/or shifting blame.  This video is probably the first depiction that I've ever seen that clearly states both the problematic/repugnant nature of the community with empathy of how someone could go so far astray. 
One small critique:  The host (I say this like its not a personally maintained channel) mentions the thrill of politically incorrect speech as a motivator for initiates of these communities, but I disagree.  I think it is primarily the arrogance of confirmation bias.  Particularly, that by recognizing and embracing a reality where one is (for an unwillingness to look up a better word) unfuckable, that it gives power to the perceived predicament.  To pile onto the cutters' analogy, they turn their own (nurtured) celibacy into a blade to cut into their respective egos, and hold the pain as truth.  Which is ultimately where the analysis goes in the video so maybe I got too tripped up on an ultimately small point.

TL;DR:  I literally hate to make public comments.  That's the important part.",21,1,2018-08-22T09:36:12.000Z

They really don't understand that hanging around other incels keeps them at that mindset/level. It will be interesting to see in 30 years how many incels will still be into this....

- Power is all that matters.  (But we aren't megalomaniacs... really... we aren't...)
- Genetics are everything/nothing
- Both aren't completely and unadulteratedly racist... (in our own rulebooks.)
- As long as (women willingly choose men/trump is president) life is horrible!
- Steps of the black pill / post modernist theory takes the same amount of ridiculous logical leaps.
- Both are their own worst enemies.
- Both need better parenting.
- Believe in their teens, 20's or 30's they know all about life and how everything works.
- Both rile themselves up to justify violence.
- Both often believe ""We need to burn it all down and start over.""
- As a <insert personal identity here> you can never understand me... because... human empathy doesn't exist, and method acting isn't possible, and yeah...  So I won't listen.
- Science is king! (Except when it doesn't benefit us, then we love confirmation bias!)

Not sure if the last part of this video will be taken well. It might be interpreted as literal by the *inceloids* .,0,0,2018-08-22T03:11:58.000Z
"While I agree with the bulk of the video, there are a few things that I either disagree with or think need to be looked at closer. 

The first is that it is my belief that there are two types of Incels. The ""incels"" and the incels‚Ñ¢. The latter being the ones discussed in the video. The former being those that fit all of the criteria of being an incel‚Ñ¢ but don't believe in the incel‚Ñ¢ mindset or hatred they seem to fester in. It is my belief that those that are ""incel"" vastly outnumber the incel‚Ñ¢ that is seen and displayed in this video. People that fall into this former ""incel"" crowd may have fears related to being falsely accused of something and don't take any risk. Some of these fears are somewhat grounded especially in the aftereffects of many false rape cases that were proven false in court where the lives of those falsely accused were absolutely destroyed despite being proven innocent. I'll close this opening paragraph with this, ""why risk it?""

The second is the 80/20 Rule. Now, while I think it is ridiculous that this happens on a majority scale, in your own video show that image of hypergamy you'll see a few icons of some dating sites listed up there. It actually shows that the 80/20 Rule does take effect primarily on dating sites. The thing with this is that I think it needs to be examined further, mainly as we see more relationships forming more online versus in person and starting through an app or website and is projected to increase in future years. This, of course, does throw up a few red flags for the future if this trend that is seen and observed on dating sites where men are rated more harshly than women in the looks department by the opposite sex. These results are shown in that OKCupid study they did a while back. You did point this out in the Tinder section, but I figured that this should at least be brought up for specifically other dating sites outside of Tinder. 

The third and final thing that I wanted to at least bring up are the disabled types. This is one that I think needs to at least be addressed. Think for one moment, and I mean one if you were perfectly normal one moment and you got in some kind of accident. It doesn't matter what kind, but it leaves you paralyzed from the neck down. Wouldn't these types of people be considered ""incels"" (please note the difference noted above)? Of course, that's catastrophic thinking, but it does make you think about it for a moment. 

This last little part does out to all the actual Incels out there, the ones that are described in this video. If you by chance see this: get help. I mean it. Go to your father or father figure (grandpa if needed). Trust me, they've more than likely been in the same situation as you before and will at least be able to get you started on the right track.

"15:20 I‚Äôm not sure I would want to see Jordan Peterson in his capacity as a clinical psychologist if I was transgender or an InCel though. I am not a qualified expert. But I am taking a look at a collaborative paper he contributed on about ‚ÄùPsychological Entropy‚Äù. An excerpt from this paper gives me concerns: -

‚ÄúThere is growing evidence that the goals adopted by an individual serve to bias both perception and action in line with goal-relevant information and behavioral options...   ... A similar notion is emphasized by clinical psychologists who attempt to help their clients move beyond the narrow horizons provided by maladaptive goals that are difficult or impossible to achieve... ‚Äù

I mean it depends what you classify as ‚Äòmaladaptive‚Äô? Also this may seem like a criticism of bias in pursuit of a person‚Äôs goal, but this is in the context of paper that also says that ‚Äúpsychological Entropy‚Äù is reduced if decisions are made by not considering all options equally ‚Äì i.e. that certain options, in reference to a person‚Äôs goals, should be ‚Äúweighted‚Äù ‚Äì again, weighted how exactly?

It‚Äôs a bit of a leap to say this perhaps. But the brains of schizophrenic people (not the paranoid kind necessarily) ‚Äì with the excess trimming of neural tissue the conditions causes (i.e. reduction of gray matter and destruction of complex neural networks) ‚Äì technical have ‚Äúlow entropy‚Äù‚Ä¶     Perhaps you could say, people with schizophrenia have ‚Äúlow psychological entropy‚Äù.

Rather than blaming the chads.

A more aligned or equal distribution would be most easily achieved through maximizing women's rights whilst minimizing male polygyny.

This is important also because status, and not skull shspe, is what likely determines chadship in real life. Thus, we can assume the ruling class males are basically able to control the entire system and culture of society's sexuality.  Essentially bourgeois cultural hegemony. 

So naturally,  the logical thing for incels to do, in their group self-interest, is try to prevent men with power from imposing social darwinist and misogynistic sexual culture.",0,1,2018-08-22T00:19:19.000Z

"I haven't seen a better, more compassionate, and more on-point video on incels.

I used to do the online dating thing. One thing I would do is ""scope out the competition"" by making a female account on dating sites to see what it's like for women on the site. In my experience, the male to female ratio of most dating sites is around 30 to 1. Every woman on a dating site gets to choose between 30 different guys.

I eventually figured out that men have to distinguish themselves, rise above the pack, to get any success on dating sites. Simply saying ""hi,"" ""hey,"" or ""sup?"" will get you nowhere because each woman is probably getting a minimum of 29 other men sending them messages too.

The trouble is: this is really hard. It requires creativity, the willingness to put yourself out there, you can't be desperate or thirsty, but you have to take it somewhat seriously as well. You also can't be creepy in any way, if you give off those creep vibes you're done for.

Why such an imbalance? I think the biggest reason is that most dating sites are designed, built, and operated by men. They've created an environment that's comfortable for men, but not at all comfortable for women. I also suspect that there's the cultural issue of women being actively and forcefully discouraged from ""making moves"" on men. Signing up for a dating site is, in many respects, being way more forward than we allow women to be, and I'm sure many women don't feel comfortable putting themselves out there like that. If there are 30 men for every woman on most sites, then it's obvious that men are far more likely to resort to dating sites. Women don't often get to that point, or they aren't given the opportunity to get to that point. I imagine many women from religious and/or conservative families, who have male members of their families acting as sexual gatekeepers, aren't going to be using dating sites very often.

Online dating isn't a panacea. In fact, I'd argue that online dating can be depressing, discouraging, and lead to a reduced sense of self worth. I think the very best thing a man can do is focus on hobbies and activities that interest them. Choose some that get you out of the house and meeting new people, try things you'd never think to try, do volunteer work that requires you to interact with people and requires you to be somewhat selfless, try out non-traditional sports, don't do things like sit around playing WoW for 8 hours a day. If you gain a genuine passion for something , that'll shine through and make you more attractive to the people you find attractive.

I think the best way to think about online dating sites is as one of your dating tools, not the be all and end all. Plus, I imagine profiles look more impressive when you can augment it with stuff you do outside and offline.",2,0,2018-08-21T23:13:00.000Z

"I just had to sub. 

I'm a woman and if there is something ive done unconsciously is go to those forums, and also read stuff that is just this incel-like complete hatred of women every time, even thought i knew i wouldnt represent their stupid stereotypes of women (they literally don't see us as humans, just fuck holes) and that i felt terrible every time i read those...

Reading a large group of men is building this kind of ""cult"" that just focuses on farming a sick hate towards us is freaking scary, because you can algo go and think ""these are just a bunch of losers on the internet"" but then, you could also realize these are pretty average looking guys (heck, even for my eyes some were cute...) and any of them could be literally any guy around me. So it's like I'd read these forums to remind myself you're never too cautious, and it's ok to stay paranoid and scared (which, and you can guess... hurt my psyche pretty badly at the time). 

It is scary to know someone wants to harm me just for my sex. It is painful to know that getting prettier for yourself can make one of these resentful freaks just want to hurt you, watch you suffer or kill you. To the point I spent most of my teens doing the exact opposite most girls do, and try to look repulsive. That was like a way I'd feel ""protected"".

I've always been a person who's had tried to not fall for this idiotic radical feminist thought that what all men want is sex, and use us for sex, etc. There are women who are assholes too, I know... but making these totalitarian statements make me sick. 

Anyway, it's not like it's wise to ignore dangerous people like this exist, but one shouldn't forget there is also actually wonderful people around.

"My sega gamegear has given me a prophecy of the future and it can go one of two ways
1.Prostitution is legalized in a manner that emphasizes consent and safety for sex workers. Incels who want to experience sex and are not yet completely enveloped by this ideology (and there are a lot on the fringes, who aren't super deep into it but are at risk of becoming so) can go to a brothel, get laid, maybe travel around a bit and do some acid, gain perspective on life and lose this toxic ideology. Maybe convert their anger and energy into something productive instead of feeling hopeless all the time. 
2.Mass conversion of Incels to Islam.  It's really a match made in hell if you think about it. Horny men believing stupid shit that doesn't exist, longing for a sense of traditionalism that does not exist.  We could see some serious shit.

As you show, entering into a socially uncomfortable phase of life can be a catalyst for this spiral of reinforcing self-loathing, but your break-out and especially your outside look-in to your own experience is actually extremely interesting and I look forward to seeing the rest of your content!

"The statistics around divorce, dating sites and alimony alone tell their own story. If you don't recognise the issues men in general have with marriage and cohabiting with women then you really are going to be at odds with most men going forward. Trying to convince feminists that this is an issue is pointless because they want to destroy and remake society. The really strange thing is the men advocating distancing from women and giving feminists what they want get demonised the most, not Incels. MGTOW gets a special kind of hatred. That is. because feminists want men controlled in thought but always there to provide resource. Distancing, not marrying means men no longer handing money to women. Because this is a battle for power and ultimately control of resource after all, feminists tell us this directly, unashamedly. If this were not the case the MGTOW, or monk approach would be applauded. Anyways, MGTOW and Men's rights are actually getting men to talk to each other about the problems specifically they face, regardless of race. This is ultimately going to be the solution to prevent Incel mentality taking hold widely so demonising any kind of men's advocacy really is going to pour petrol on an already volatile situation.
I really can't deal with the Mysogyny arguments about men, in some cases justified, venting about female nature and the state in combination. We really have had enough of a hatchet job done on male identity already so vitriolic feminists and allies can get used to the criticism. Deal with it.
A bit of advice for Incels. Get a motorcycle. You can channel that fatalism to ecstasy. You'll be on the edge of death routinely and loving every moment.  You'll want to ride it as a preference even when the option of sex is there. What depression? Self loathing? Gone

"Henk Janssen 
My best friend was one of the least attractive men I'd ever met. The first time I saw him I was amazed anyone could look that way. He wasn't monstrously ugly, just weirdly shaped with a large head. 

We grew close because of our love of stories and deep need for other to help us complete them while we enjoy their input. After a while he started to look more normal to me, because I saw him everyday. I  noticed he had beautiful eyes. A nose similar to my partner (my partner is 5""1 and I'm 5""4. He's very attractive to me as an Asian man with feminine features) 

His head is large but it's endearing.  He jokes about how hard it is to find a hat that fits him because it's true. He has so much charm and charisma. My boyfriend and myself have taken to writing erotic stories together with him,  whenever characters would feasibly sleep together we dive in with detail set to the characters personality and move on to the rest of the story. 

Point is, I love him, and he is more attractive to me now than he was when I met him. In a world where my boyfriend and I hadn't met so early (6th grade dating) I could have seen us together. Not without some arguing over roleplay business but quite happy. 

He's such a good writer I'm in love with one or two of his characters legitimately. Just thought I'd add that, his talent deserves mention.",2,2,2018-08-21T18:20:00.000Z

"I'd like to say thank you because this video definitely made me feel better. I don't know if I'd classify myself as an incel, because my celibacy is anything but involuntary. How could I call it involuntary when I've never actually tried anything? I occasionally get thoughts that lead up to what would be considered as catastrophizing. It's actually quite ridiculous come to think of it, imagining someone who literally lays down all day and expects things to change in his life... The incel community on the internet seems ridiculous even to me, actually having a term like ""femoid""... However, knowing where they come from, I don't think they should be mocked. Their petty behavior stems from desperation because of what they think is mother nature telling them that they are the end of their gene pool which at the moment can be very hard to swallow, I know because I also feel that way sometimes. I fail to see that it is my behavior that is unattractive and not my literal genes... In fact, I was rejected by a girl just because I was a virgin and she thought I had a testosterone disorder because of it. It had a huge impact on my confidence and has rendered me incapable of asking girls out since, but I know that I just have to risk getting rejected and not take it as such a big deal...",59,44,2018-08-21T17:42:55.000Z

Hearing you talk about digital self-harm and communities dedicated to despair and pessimism really hit home for me, I turned into a self-loathing zealot, combating the common misogyny with the gospel of It's Your Own Fault and Let's Kill Ourselves, poisoning every community I participated in with despair. It felt like no one outside those communities were being honest with their vapid platitudes (like the widely mocked ""just b urself""), and so it's easy for me to understand how people get into shit like the Black Pill or any other conspiracy theory where you have a community of enlightened individuals who have figured out the real truths you won't hear from normies, even if those truths only make you miserable.

Your mention of mental illness also made me realize that my time in those communities probably weren't great for my own issues. I'm still as depressed, isolated and sexless as I was back then, but it feels like I spent so much time and energy crushing anything resembling hope (my favorite quote was ""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils, because it prolongs the torments of men."") that even years after my main community imploded after everyone either had enough of me or killed themselves, the idea that not everything is hopeless and improvement is possible seems totally absurd to me. It feels like I sabotaged my own life so badly that it became a self-fulfilling prophecy.

BTW, another interesting thing from a social-anthropological perspective: You mention that when people post selfies in incel communities today, they will receive mostly comments reaffirming their belief that they're unfuckable. My memories of /r9k/ around 2013 was closer to the opposite: Incels would post their selfies with some comment about how extremely ugly they were, but the replies would refute that and deny them membership in the incel community because they looked like fucking chads. I noticed this in many of the surrounding communities as well, there was a sort of ""must be this broken to ride"" mentality where we wanted a safe space free from normies who wouldn't understand our woes.

"I found it really interesting that this video turned to the subject of trans issues, cause while all the incel-self-hate was going on in my mind I (a closeted trans-woman) was (without intending to) using their concerns about their ""feminine"" features as a check against my own features. I have really tiny wrists (and have always needed women's watch straps cause of it) so I was a little overjoyed to be reminded of that fact, but then disappointed when foreheads were brought into it cause I have a masculine forehead.

Oh, another really interesting aspect of all of this is the baking-dude. I think the fact he (and presumably other incels) are so obsessed with not doing femme things, probably actually makes them physically less attractive. In an era where (progressive) men are more than ever using plenty of self-grooming and even some makeup to improve their appearance, this incel avoidance of even the most basic of hygiene and other femme activities has got to be taking a big toll on their simple ability to function. Like, they probably can't cook or clean...",0,0,2018-08-21T15:48:00.000Z

"9:06 I disagree with you on this point. Incels, PUA's, MGTOW and MRA's do all have the ""Red Pill"" concept, but each group gives it a different meaning. 

The Incel Red Pill dictates that money, power and physical appearance are the only way into a woman's pants. This differs from the PUA variant which suggests that these aren't necessary, but they help. What really gets women going is ""game"" i.e. the ability to excite women in conversation with wit, social intelligence and confidence. Notice how Incel's disregard all of these traits and keep things superficial? 

MGTOW's red pill claims that women are only good for a ""pump and dump"" i.e. no relationships. Just sex. Anything more is a liability because women will slow men down in their career goals, try to control their hobbies or free time, destroy them in divorce court and screw them with child support. While it does mention sexuality, this red pill doesn't talk about _how_ to get laid. Merely to keep relationships strictly sexual if you choose to have one at all. Finally, MRA red pills say that western society is inherently gynocentric and ignores the issues that men face in favour of prioritising, sensationalising and over-committing to women's issues and mere inconveniences. No mention of how to get laid here. 

Of course, there are overlaps between these definitions - e.g. PUA red pilling can allow one to indulge in the MGTOW lifestyle, or Incels use the MRA red pill to validate their own conclusions. The concept of Hypergamy only factors into the Incel and MGTOW red pills. Incels think that women want better than them and MGTOW think hypergamy justifies many divorce cases and cheating stories.Ultimately, however, these are still not the same ""red pill"".",0,0,2018-08-21T13:51:25.000Z

Intel misogyny is just bitter men projecting their self-hatred onto the object of their deep desire.,37,1,2018-08-21T10:59:31.000Z
"This is the first video I've seen of yours and it's solid. Good watch and good advice.

Incels are largely just terrible people, via natural clownfuckery or bent that way by the community. That alone makes most unfuckable but there are a decent percentage that clearly have a masochistic relationship with the community/belief. Many *DO* simply need to go outside, get off the forum, exercise, etc.


I've always been a generic motherfucker. Look at me. Yes, it's a joke-pic I took for someone a few years ago that I'm too lazy to change but that's me. I'm no Chad (lol).

I bring that up to say that dating/casual sex *IS* a marketplace and my niche has always been personality. I don't think I've ever had a woman oogle or ogle over me. In fact, I've heard from damn near all of them that it wasn't until we really spoke and got to know each other that they liked me. Humor helps and I've always been a fairly personable guy.

So, I also do have a tiny smidge of understanding for what an incel feels/believes. I know I'm a 5/10 physically, a 6/10 on a good day. I'm nkt short, not tall. I'm not fat but fluctuate between skinny and ""somewhat normally proportioned"". I'm very average and becoming below-average with age üòÖ.

So, how could I possibly attract anyone?  Well, you stop obsessing about yourself and do it. 
 Sure, I've been rejected. Plenty of women have said ""I'm sorry but..."". It's not their fault and I'm not to blame. Maybe they had a bad day or a recent breakup or I'm not their type. Ok. That's cool. 

It's that simple. You don't get to fuck or love anyone you want because you want to and the world isn't conspired against you because of that fact. 

I'm sorry we can't all be born as 25yo Brad Pitt. It sucks but actually try, accept rejection *when* it comes, move on, don't kill people and it'll work out for most.",1,0,2018-08-21T10:56:52.000Z

"You're getting a couple of things wrong.
A) Two events over five years is hardly ""producing mass murderers at an alarming rate"". On any given day, before lunch the world view of Islam racks up a higher body count.
B) There is no shared ""Red Pill World View"". The Red Pill is a metaphor used to say ""I as an individual/We as a group realized a truth, that wider society refuses to face"". That's it. The world view of the various groups that use that metaphor largely depends on the nature of that truth. Incels say: ""Women are superficial and reject men based on things those men cannot change"". Pick Up Artists say: ""Picking up women is a skill every man can learn."" Those are diametrically opposed, so how can there be a shared world view? Granted, there are some shared elements; but those concern a very basic level; the in my opinion most important being the refusal to believe women are more noble, pure and complex than men, but that's no basis to lump them together.

Though some of the things incels think are way off, there is some truth to others. Studies show that women take about 10 seconds to decide whether they consider a guy fuck-worthy or not. A decision made so quickly must by definition be superficial and it cannot be based on his character, because 10 seconds are nowhere near enough time to get an insight into a person's character. A couple of years back OK Cupid published data about how its users rate the other sex. Men's ratings of women followed slightly slanted bell curve; giving about 55% of women a rating of three stars or more. Women's ratings of men were very different; giving 80% of men two stars or less. So even if they get the reasons wrong, incels get one thing right: Men on the lower end of the attractiveness scale have next to no chance of getting laid; because women have a very skewed notion as to what an ""avaragely attractive man"" is, shoot for men that are out of their league and refuse to ""settle"" for men that are similarly attractive as they are. It is those women that have the common ""where have all the good men gone?""-complaint. And these women are the other side of the incel medallion. And this is very society get unfair: When a man finds himself unable to get laid, society blames him, and tells him he must have a shitty character. Which - given the knowledge that women take only ten seconds to decide - is just a mean way to add insult to injury. When women find themselves unable to get into a relationship society doesn't blame them, it tells men ""man up and give those wonderful women the adoration, happyness, relationship, children they deserve"".
The ""incel problem"" could be fixed quite easily: *Stop telling men that have trouble getting laid that they're unworthy pieces of that deserve the crap they're getting from the women they try to approach.* Instead tell them that their value as human being doesn't depend on their ability to get laid; tell to have some pride and self-respect, and women that give them crap after ten seconds of interaction are unworthy of men's love, lust and attention anyway. Gender relations should become more equitable. They way things are now, men undersell themselves. Wherever relationships are depicted in the media, it's always the men that need to prove they're worthy of the things women bring into a relationship, while women are absolutely and no questions asked entitled to whatever the man brings into the relationsship. Equitable relations would require women to prove themselves worthy, just like men are expected to. A man who gave a ""pump and dump"" gave her an infinitely greater chance to prove herself worthy of his love than a woman that after ten seconds decided to reject a guy. I know that's not particularly flattering to women, and that saying will most likely get me called a misogynist woman-hater, but that doesn't mean it's not the truth.",2,0,2018-08-21T10:26:12.000Z

"I find that I relate and even agree with a lot of what mgtow and incels have to say. I guess the difference with me is that I have let go of a lot of the hate and frustration of rejection. I have also decided to live differently and base my self esteem on my own individuality and self improvement. This includes not comparing myself to others ( I don't always succeed but thats the intention). I think incels have been created from situations where they either don't understand or misunderstand women and th expected dating/society norms or they refuse to conform . Personally I probably am an Incel that doesn't label himself as one, I just label myself an individual. In terms of the violence and isolation, if a society doesn't want people to be violent or isolate themselves then encourage people to stop bullying people and encourage people to be more accepting and respectful of differences. Also encourage women to date men of all types, remove the external pressures of people saying that they shouldn't date one person or another as well. There is an inequality in the dating world between men and women. There are far more male incels than female because women get chased.",0,0,2018-08-21T09:22:23.000Z

3) Incels have a lot in common with radical feminists. The other gender wronged me ('arbitrary' rejection / slight), it wronged me often so it's systemic and I'm oppressed, it's morally OK to hate my oppressor. Scum Manifesto vs. Incel Rage - two sides of the same coin.

"So one of the main problems in the consistency of the incel philosophy (note: consistency, not truth) is I think the part where ""normies"" marry cheating wives. If this happened on such a big scale surely ""normies"" and ""Beckie's"" would suspect something? And what happens to those ""Tracies"" and ""Chads"" when they're no longer at a Chad or Tracy age? 

In my own humble opinion I think that yes, physical attractiveness is undeniably a plus, but there is a big difference between the kind of guy women would maybe be more inclined to hook up with and the kind of guy they marry. That's not how relationships work. You don't stay with someone because of their looks. (Do they long for romance or for sex?)

(Personally I tend to fall for ""normies"" with an above average intelligence over ""Chads"", but the kind of intelligence that creates new stuff and opinions, not the kind of intelligence you get from just reading a lot of wikipedia and the occasional book)

"I'm not trans or anything like that, but I can relate with the part where you spoke about the self-destructive habits people can form online. When I was going through puberty, it was easy to isolate as I was homeschooled and didn't have many close friends I could contact. Eventually I formed somewhat of an addiction to the internet, and would seek validation from people I barely knew and were probably in the same boat or worse. I neglected my health and happiness and became so attached I just wouldn't leave my chair. My social skills were crippled and i'm still fixing that today. I would sit for hours and only get up when I had to.  But I got out of it after awhile. I realized that these habits I was forming weren't healthy, and with the help of my family I was able to come out of it. Things like this can grab you and make you think you aren't good enough, or that the world has forgotten you, or that you will never succeed. People will fetishize and encourage self-destruction to already vulnerable people. You have to realize what it's doing and step back. It's hard, but there is always a way out.

"The suicide rates for trans people is tragically high, I wonder if the suicide rates for incels are comparable. I mean has any research been done on incel suicide rates? It seems like the attitude of self-loathing and helplessness is similar like you mention in this video. Many trans people feel like they'll never pass as a woman/man thus never be happy, incels feel like they'll never get laid thus never be happy. This is why we need more investment in mental health services, I think we all have hope no matter how hopeless it feels.",2,1,2018-08-21T06:11:48.000Z
"The whole perspective of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not happy therefore the whole world is fucked up and nothing will ever change‚Äù is really close to how i felt before I sought out treatment for my depression and anxiety. The truth is, these things aren‚Äôt the world‚Äôs fault, but they aren‚Äôt necessarily your fault either. But it means YOU have the responsibility to make the healthy and difficult choice of getting help from a mental health professional and going through the hard work of overcoming these negative thoughts and feelings. In therapy I learned coping mechanisms, grounding techniques, ways to overcome my fear of engaging strangers and being around people, and it took years of HARD WORK. But it‚Äôs hard work that is worth it. Stop wallowing in the negatives and get help. You cannot put all of your personal hang ups and burdens on other people who aren‚Äôt professionals and expect them to deal with all of your problems along with all of their own. Yes it‚Äôs ok to confide in people, but don‚Äôt expect every woman you meet to wade through the sea of self doubt, hatred, and lack of empathy to find the real you when even you aren‚Äôt willing to do that.

"I think a  key point from this video is one that you specifically stated but kind of brushed over, and its the idea of approach ability of a man. I thought it was really sweat of you to say something like that. Woman don't tend to express their reasons for why they dislike these men, because they tend to take a stance they they are not responsible for their circumstances ext (which isn't particularly productive). And unfortunately for those dudes a big reason is that they scaaaaaaare those ladies. RAWR but really, men who live in this depressed state tend to be afraid to confront people without realizing that the opposite is true for the people they interact with, and unfortunately there is plenty more evidence online of the woman who are fearful striking back in a more aggressive manor because they are afraid than a more understanding manor which is harder.

We complicate this shit but its easy. Men who are calling themselves incelibit are not that. They are regular celibate and sad that they haven't been able to connect with people and they don't blame woman, they fear them, because they don't know what it is they do wrong around them to make them feel that they aren't worth approaching ect. 

Fight fear with friendship and this little problem will go away.

Fight it with fire and burn them away.... well do that and we get responses from wounded animals against walls.

"Incels aside... We know that different races are... different. We have as much biodiversity as any other animal on the planet. We recognize some dogs are smarter/better at certain things, while others aren't, or have their own set of specialized evolved skills.

Humans are no different, we have a ton of biodiversity, and thanks to our intelligence, we're capable of even acknowledging certain issues we may have, and doing everything we can to work against it, which does go a long way, but we're still limited by our genetics to some degree, even outside just the idea of racial groups. We've even found links between genetics and violent crime (across all races)...

Incels and racist take this shit too far and use it as an excuse to judge every single individual of whatever group, but it doesn't make these things completely inaccurate though. Scientific knowledge is neither good nor evil, it's the human use of it that can make it good or evil, and sadly, a lot of douche bags do choose to use it for evil... But it is reality. Genetics, race, IQ, aggression, predisposition to criminal behavior... etc... and of course a degree of environment, culture, etc, all tied togther, all factors to be considered. 

Pigmentation and melanocrotin system apparently has a link to aggression and other things. 

I get how this shit can be uncomfortable and the initial reaction is to have an emotional knee jerk and reject it, but the evidence is pretty substantial. We gotta accept this shit as a reality if want to change anything for the better... We're getting to a point to start modifying this shit anyways, but we can't do that if we ignore these things, and throw up ethical arguments against even looking at it.",0,0,2018-08-21T00:28:32.000Z

"I get that these are meant to be satirical jabs at various things that you dislike which I can appreciate, but I must admit this feels like quite the biased look at a community. I guess you could consider me red pilled. I'm well aware of the biological differences both physically and mentally between men and women. I don't believe women are somehow lesser for these differences. I do recognize that things like feminism in it's modern incarnation is deleterious to society as a whole, not just the men and women it infects with it's ideology. I don't think they're worse than satan and need to be purged with fire at all points of the day, and I can at least recognize they are at least making very bumbling attempts towards what they perceive as issues which is... commendable in the same way you'd give a mentally retarded chap a gold star for not shitting their pants for the fifth day in the row. As for incels... honestly, a lot of it comes down to they're just kinda that nerdy kid in school that never got to date because there was always that hot guy that was never single for very long and they just kinda... never got the ability to grow out of it really. 

Part of that is that, honestly, the sexual market (and I know you may not like it, but it is an observable thing) very heavily favors women. there's a lot of shit a woman can do that a man just kinda can't. if a woman rapes a man it's not even considered a crime, but if a man rapes a woman it's 20+ years in prison. a Majority of marriages ends in the woman running away with the man's assets and remarrying to someone hotter in a fair whack of that majority within like 3-4 years. On top of that the 80/20 rule is actually in full swing DUE to apps like tinder and whatnot as well as a recent trend that makes it culturally acceptable to expect the hottest guy in the bar if you don't put in any work on yourself outside of what it takes to shovel ice cream and snack-cakes down her fat face. If that doesn't scream ""unfair"" then I don't know what will. So please, not asking you to sympathize with the incel lads, just do understand where they're coming from.

As for the transition, you look amazing, I wouldn't have known if you hadn't said it tbh. I don't really understand why people give a fuck about the ""sanctity of birth"" bullshit. We can do it in testubes and that's honestly safer and easier to manipulate for better results. The tried and true method just seems... barbaric to me.

EDIT: I've been lazy in making this addendum, but I do also understand that there are a lot of guys that have similar mentalities that I bitched about just now, my main point was that it's socially acceptable and encouraged for these women to do things like this. For guys, we get kinda boned if we even think of attempting the same thing. I'm not saying That either party SHOULD do these things, I'm saying that it's unfair that one is demonized while the other is praised incessantly. except rape, that you should be demonized for, but the fact that a woman can break into a man's home, piss on his walls, hold him at machete point, and force him to have sex with her and it NOT be called rape where if a man talks to a woman longer than she wants to have the conversation he can be accused of rape if he even did anything at all, have it be proven not true, and STILL be black-balled from every method of getting a job and be demonized on social media even beyond his death says a lot about how unfair things are. By the way, if you don't believe those two extremes, both of which happened, you can look them up and I guarantee you'll find exact matches on at least the machete case as well as thousands of men who were falsely accused of rape, had it proved wrong, and still had their lives ruined.

Additionally, there seem to be some people that think I'm being bitter. I'm not really. The language I use might not come off as bitter but it's more intense disappointment. Not necessarily of any one person or piece of tech in particular so much as just the society that birthed these problems in the first place and seems unwilling to fix it. Instead of, y'know, trying to shame people for doing the same thing other people get praised for.

Also, to those people that think I'm mad at hot guys, I'm not. They have an advantage but it's not one that can't be overcome with exercise and diet. A lot of incels are in a bad headspace, which is true, I never said they're not, and it causes them to be demotivated from attempting to improve their physical attributes. Part of it is that, frankly, you've got half of the human population being told ""oh, honey, you're beautiful just the way you are. You don't need to change, it's everyone else that needs to accept you for who you are"" where as the other half which these incels happen to be a part of are told ""Go to the fucking gym you strippling cuck. If you can't make six figures you're not worth my time. Plus if you're not at least (insert list of ""dream partner"" qualifications) then Why should I care about you, you fat pustulent cunt?"" and if you never had to deal with the latter, congratulations, I'm happy for you, but a lot of us HAVE so try to understand that there are people in and out of the incel ""clique"" that have had to put up with this shit far beyond it simply being a ""attitude"" problem.",4,6,2018-08-21T00:25:07.000Z

The these older men looked at me made me so uncomfortable and disgusted.

Now, these are the younger generation of the same mentality except they have a platform to communicate. They might talk about how equally attractive women should be with guys who are the same level of attractiveness.

"...this is probably not helpful, but I couldn't help being distracted during this whole video by how with your on-point make-up and lighting here, you look like Winona Ryder.  Like, every 5 seconds I'd zone out what you were saying cause I just kept thinking about how much you look like Winona Ryder.  

ANYWAY, more ""serious"" note...I think the pressure to be hyper-feminine is a transphobic sentiment that bleeds over onto cis women as well.  I'm a cis woman, and I remember feeling insecure AS A PRE-TEEN because I got it into my head that my voice was too low and ""boy-like"".  And of course many cis-women, including myself, don't have perfectly delicate features and are considered ""ugly"" for it (this sometimes crosses over with racism and ant-semitism,  but that's a whole other can of worms).  For trans-women, I imagine the stakes are much higher, and compounded by a whole host of other societal pressures and insecurities.  

I guess I would say that I don't think trans-women, or any women, should have to ""pass"" as ""feminine"" to be considered women, or to be worthy of love and respect.  I'll try and restrain myself from spouting any empty platitudes, since I know how useless that can be from some anonymous stranger dumb-ass on the internet, but just know that I wish you all the best, whatever you choose in the future.  Some assholes will always be assholes, but I'm certainly ""convinced"" that you are a woman, and it has nothing to do with what you look like (that's just a bonus).  

Not that my opinion matters--I'm just another anonymous doofus on the internet--but as someone who struggles with insecurities about my own appearance, I try to remember that my value isn't based on that, even if the world sometimes acts like it does.  A big revelation for me was when I realized that I DIDN'T really want cosmetic surgery--all those things that I was insecure about, like my crooked nose and big forehead, were things I could conceivably change if I really tried.  But then I wouldn't ""look like me"" anymore, and I didn't like that.  I may not be that pretty, but that's MY crooked nose and big forhead, y'know?  From what I understand, you and women like you are trying to look more like yourselves, to be seen as what you are, and who you are.  That doesn't mean you have to look a certain way, a ""feminine"" way, a conventionally ""hot"" or ""pretty"" way, if that's not what's right for you, if that particular indicator of ""femininity"" doesn't ""fit"" for you in particular.  You're still women.

"Not sure I count as an incel. I haven't had much vaginal intercourse in the last decade. I have a girlfriend. We were both sexually abused for extended periods of our youth. She provides footsex and I have a foot fetish so that helps. I try to give her oral but she thinks her pussy is disgusting which I disagree with. Most vaginas...in my experience...have a metallic scent that I find strong but, intoxicating. I've made it clear that I would never force her to do anything she truly doesn't want to do....any physical activity requires some coaxing. I have referred to vaginas as roast beef-looking but I've never made this point to suggest the women who owned them were slutty. My use of the comparison is just referring to how the outer lips (labia majora I think) sometimes share coloration with deli roast beef. That is, more pinkish towards the center, darkening towards the outside, to almost black. Not all pussies look this way...some do, and I haven't noticed a connection between this and slutty women. To be clear I say slut to refer to a woman that gets into a clearly defined monogamous relationship under the pretense of understanding that's what she's doing. If this woman screws 10 or 15 other guys in 1 month, while trying to hide these affairs....then yeah she's a slut. I've been in many long term relationships  I've dated women that fuck up....ask for a second chance and I've always asked if they are sure. Do they want to be exclusive....do you want to try and share our lives. They all said yes. Some continued fucking everything with legs and I eventually learned they were slutty jerks that apparently didn't want to hurt my feelings...at least...not to my face. I expect men to be loyal under the same conditions. It's fine if people want to have open relationships...I tried that shit and tried to kill myself twice because it made me feel jealous and worthless....so it doesn't seem healthy for me. idk....am I an incel....I don't care much for lables anyway....I don't feel like I fit in any where...most ppl in general make me feel like a bug under a magnifying glass. My GF and our pets...and other animals are the only beings I feel truely comfortable around. Your the one with a YouTube channel....you tell me if I qualify as incell.",0,0,2018-08-20T21:46:56.000Z
"I'm a 35 year old straight white male... virgin.

Yeah, sure, I'll openly admit it. And yeah, sure I'll say I've had my sexual frustrations because of it. I've lived under the lonely Asperger rock my entire life. :P

But I've never attributed my virginity to my happiness or well being. Loneliness maybe.... But never the fact on whether I'm getting laid or not. Sex does not = happiness. Sex is an act of pleasure and a necessity for procreation, that is it.

Your companionship with your significant other aught to be a close loving friendship. Sex can be a benefit of that relationship, but it should never be the primary reason for it.

All that being said, I've viewed the incel and MGTOW movements to be horribly toxic and negative influences (much like I view certain far left SJW movements, but thats for another discussion.)

There are far more better and positive things out there to hyper-focus on. I would advise seeking them out and avoiding these negative hate groups like the plague.

Re: Vocabulary, I'm thinking it's a prerequesite almost to creating a specific kind of worldview - so let's say we all think in a certain language, using the terms we most commonly use and see used. These in turn represent concepts, which are basically a raw representation of the world. Since the current words in use are generally well defined by cultural background (contexts, types of significances and even the mood associated) and as such are less malleable, creating a new set of words basically allows the immediate association of those words to some new, extreme concepts with their use surrounding the users in a world where those notions take center stage, immediately adapting them to the person and creating an environment where their use is not only normal but also correct.
TL;DR - If anyone tries to introduce new terms for extremized versions of stuff that's already there - be very heckin' skeptical! That's a fairly worn but surprisingly efficient manipulation tehnique.",0,0,2018-08-20T21:43:15.000Z

"This is going to be a long comment, heads up! 

I kind of sympathize with incels to some extent. I'm not one for women hating or blaming and I disagree with a lot of the beliefs they have because a lot of it is self-defeating or toxic. What I do relate to is the feeling of inferiority, especially when it comes to looks and how you've been judged/rejected for it. I've been made fun of for my looks, so i really understand that dysmorphia they have. I look significantly older than everyone else my age. I hit puberty really early. I could grow a full beard at 14. I'm 20 now, but people think I'm more closer to 30. Girls used to say that I looked too old to date them or that I was a pedo. If it wasn't how old I looked, it was my physical features. I was fat, mind you but it was never really something people made fun of for me as much even though it definitely makes me unattractive to a good chunk of girls.

 What I was made fun of was my teeth. I have some fucked up buck teeth! They are healthy and pearly white, but because my family used up a lot of the insurance to fix their more severe problems, I never had braces. My sister cost my parents $400,000 in dental because her issues were much worse than my purely aesthetic reasons for braces. 

Last but not least, my jawline is shit! Even though I went through puberty at a young age and got a lot of testosterone, I severely burned my chin as a child on a stove. Since it damaged the tissue, my chin never grew in well and I cover up the scars with facial hair. My dad had an amazing chin, so I might have had one too if it weren't for that. The thing is, I probably wouldn't care that much at all if I wasn't bullied over my chin. I was lucky enough to have facial hair in my teen years, because whenever I shaved PEOPLE noticed and a couples of girls who said they thought I was okay-ish looking IMMEDIATELY retracted their statements. 

 Middle-school and high school really fucked me up on how I perceive myself. I was voted the ugliest guy in school in an anonymous poll, below even those with mental disabilities (which was super fucked up people actually included them on such a list). I got rejected so fucking much and still do. I've only had one girlfriend but she dumped me because she didn't find me physically attractive. I guess the difference with me and incels is that I never stopped trying and keep trying to better myself.

 I wish I had some kind of happy ending like ""Now I have a beautiful girlfriend and I'm no longer a virgin!"" but I can say that my life has improved after therapy and getting out of toxic places (fuck high school). I still have trouble dating wise as I still get rejected a lot, but I have a great group of friends and I'm pursuing my passions such as music and cars. I also started to dress like how I wanted instead of being fearful of how people would judge which in turn has benefited me because people like my style. I found a lot of validation with my sub-culture, including getting to know some of my favorite musicians personally. People know me and like me for who I am. Girls appreciate my personality, but I still haven't had much success in attracting them romantically even though I have a lot of friends who are girls. I'm still a hopeless virgin, but it hasn't ruined my life. I do what I want to do and feel fulfilled. The worst thing that can happen in improving yourself is that you'll just create a better life for yourself even if you can't find love. Having a generally good life but no love is a better outcome than not having both.

Cheers",31,6,2018-08-20T21:21:25.000Z

Stop putting women on a pedestal, they are people just like you, if what you are crying about is that you cant find a GF because these women only care about ""chads"" then maybe you are looking in the wrong places? maybe YOUR standards are too high?

"That dark vortex incels are pulled into is unfortunately very familiar to me. I know its destructive charm. The feelings of crippling self-doubt and hopelessness often surround me, but they also come with a certain degree of comfort. Paradoxically the certainty of doom is psychologically preferable to the harrowing suspicion of an impending doom. We catastrophize, because the idea of ""dying alone"" feels better than a prospect of ""*maybe* finding someone someday, and that someone may not be The Big One we really want, but *maybe* it's marginally better than staying alone"".  Being ""sentenced"" to eternal loneliness sounds like a cosmic injustice, but it's also perversely satisfying. After all, if ""everything is already lost"" you don't need to do anything.  You can enjoy the sweet martyrdom. On the other hand it's unfair to blame someone for not trying hard enough, when he/she feels like he/she is surrounded by mountains of evidence to prove the direness of his/her situation. This is probably some evolutionary adaptation to conserve energy, like laziness. Change is impossible if you don't believe in the possibility of change.

"There is no such thing as this mythical, whimsical ""Incel"". I will downvote this video as well as others circle the drain on this same subject and similar subjects, because everyone of them ostensibly misses the real issue and/or diverts attention away from the true issue via obfuscation fallacies and moving of the goalposts.

It is just another curious case of a Internet culture and a decadent society so often in the West and even abroad, and its peculiar and incessant obsession with labels, identifiers and monikers. But, once the label and moniker has finally mades its rounds along rabbit hole that is the Interwebs it has successfully imbedded itself in the psyche 

This video is almost utterly useless with the sole exception being that it helps highlight this twisted, insane, banal internet culture and Internet forums! Once again, the main issue is always diverted away from the true problem or diagnosis.

The US and most of the West and even the world is heavily mind-controlled, with mass mind-control propaganda permeating everywhere, nearly everything and in every facet of modern society, just as Cathy O'Brien and Mark philips in their book, ""TranceFormation of America"", have described it as.
Elliot Rodgers was not some non-existent ""Incel""! He was, I am 100% certain a victim of mind-control from a pervasive and perverse Hollywood elite culture that sucks the the very soul from your being. Elliot came from a rich Hollywood father and he drove around in a BMW, obviously provided via his rich financial standing, and he expected women to throw themselves at him, thats not an ""incel"" that is a poor deluded individual possibly suffering from Mk-Ultra/Project Monarch or other trauma based mind control.

There have been millions of virginal men and even women throughout all of recorded human history, and not ONE of them has been slapped with this label an ""incel"" (there's that weaselly moniker and label again). Were Isaac Newton and Nikola Tesla both incels because they never married and reportedly never layed with a women? Or, are they exempt because they were both scientific geniuses?

Being so desperate to fit in, and then knowing how desperate and sad you are, and have people tell you that you are indeed desperate and sad... made me sad.

"I think youre right that the self loathing of incels, which is similar self loathing due to body dysmorphia of some women, is likely to be more depressing, orbitting a black hole and fatalistic just because men are expected to pursue relationships, while women are not. Assumming that I have understood you correctly. Its still more likely that a self loathing woman find a man at least occasionally, than an incel finds a woman. (Some and some, generalization extravaganzza, Im ignoring non-heterosexual orientations etc.) The terrible thing for incels is that in order to stop being one, which they often dont believe to be possible, is to suffer through a stream of rejections and painful learning, which looks catastrophic prior going through that, and really ends up being so after trying for a while. It still leaves long term scars, memories and wounded emotions that never go away. The older one gets, the more deep it cuts. Most people go through that learning period, while still being teenage morons about it. On top of that staying in the church of incel make the things ever-present, ready-to-be consumed darkness, which can make it oddly more digestable for the confirmation it provides.

"@ContraPoints 
Whoa! Flash backs of The Game book from 2008 when I found my way into the pick up community before I fully accepted my bisexuality.
The self Loathing in the community is quite blatant. 
The obsession with categorisation and is similar to other isms. The bone structure analogy  reminded of racist literature.
The idea of average frustrated chump and becoming a PUA was going fix all my problems, It never did.

I was still going from one world to the other, from trans dating sites where I accept I'm attracted to trans woman to pua sites where no one talk about bisexual at it all about, ""sarging"" ,
""merging sets"" and demonstrating higher value etc.
It dawned on me  very slowly one day that all of it wasn't given my self-esteem any benefits and really was an insult to mine myself and my sexuality.

It's been over 10 years since since I stopped doing the pua crap and a few relationships later I do feel better for it.

I do get a few from trans community asking to ""smash my new pussy""
and now I would prefer a walk in the park first or even a ""how's your days doing"" before I smash anything.",0,0,2018-08-20T16:25:51.000Z

"I think a piece of the puzzle of *why* people would ever seek out these abusive comments can be found in cognitive psychology. As a cognitively minded psychologist, I'm pretty much honor-bound to say that, but hear me out.

Basically, we have certain ways of seeing ourselves and the world and those views can be deeply entrenched. And worse, we don't *like it* when we have to change them. It's scary. Your current world-view might be self-destructive and dysfunctional, but changing them is hard and uncomfortable. So we try to find ways to justify not changing. To justify our existing beliefs. 

And that might be why people seek out those kinds of forums and comments. Not out of a masochistic desire to be humiliated, but to justify staying the same rather than doing the unpleasant work to become better.

So great to hear that you're on the right path, though!",68,4,2018-08-20T16:21:56.000Z

"I think a large part of the draw when it comes to the red pill philosophy is that society at large is so dogmatically unwilling to so much as hear it even in the circumstances where they are objectively right. (eg: the sexual marketplace thing) And will instead resort to the moral argument & all the buzzwords.
The problem is that this is the exact same strategy that traditionalist religions employed. And these for the most part are 90s/00s kids that grew up in the death throes of religion's time at the top of the cultural hegemony of the western world. The comforting lie that there's a loving god who cares about you personally had to be brushed aside to move forward, and the truth was anything but comforting for a lot of people.
And now they're faced with the dilemma in that thus far, their attempts to find love have failed spectacularly despite what may well be genuine attempts to apply the advice they've heard all throughout childhood. Questioning everyone who's ever told them ""you're a nice guy, anyone would be lucky to have you... not me... but someone"".

I think this makes most of the recent mainstream media's attempts to shit on them really ineffective and dangerous. It's compounded the disenfranchisement & martyrdom appeal. But it's doubled down on the reductionist and wrong interpretations and made them look more and more like the religious right trying to paint things they don't like as ""devil worship"". I feel like this can only embolden incels into thinking they're actually on the right track, and that their opposition is going into full damage control mode to try and cover up their ""truth"".

*Seriously, well done on this video.* It's super refreshing to see someone actually get this shit remotely close to right. Even among the usual suspects of the ""skeptic community"" (the ones you'd expect to at least entertain the devil's advocate position), it's usually just a race to disassociate & throw them under the bus.

While most manosphere movements will only talk about female hypergamy (women marry up), the conveniently leave out male hypergamy (men seek fertile women, i.e youth and beauty).

"Good video, instant subscribe.

I wanna talk about an incel-adjacent thing that's very relevant to the video. Hopefully some good will come out of it?

Incels are mostly unreachable, but there's a group that's essentially incels-in-training: the self-proclaimed ""Nice Guys"". They exhibit very similar traits - the misogyny, the self-hatred, the way they objectify women, the terminology (""Chad"" being a popular term, and they're not at the ""femoids"" stage yet, but they're curiously fond of the term ""females""). Their behaviour is different, though, they're at the stage of trying really hard, not yet locked into a cynical world view. Instead, they tend to whine about how women don't appreciate them.

Nice Guys and incels basically share the same perspective, insecurities while differeing in tactics. The go-to move of a Nice Guy is to expect sex as a prize for being remotely friendly and polite, and any rejection feeds the confirmation bias about how ""being nice makes you lose"" (see the proto-incel worldview there?). On the flipside, Nice Guys aren't as fanatic as incels, don't really have a community, and honestly some of what they claim and do is an extreme version of the mentality of the less-adjusted teenage boys (because teenage boys are dumb. Duh.).

Nice Guys just don't grow out of that phase for some reason. And that ""they don't grow out of it"" part is why a Nice Guy is a prime targets for recruitment for incels. I say that as a former Nice Guy, and a pretty bad one. In hindsight, I only didn't go in that direction due to a few radical and emotionally painful course-corrections and self-reevaluations.

The video is not directly about Nice Guys, but I made the connection the instant there was talk about catastrophising. That's a key similarity - Nice Guys don't do that yet, but they are developing the attitude that devolves into catastrophising incel-style eventually. Still not there, but approaching the point of no return.

My point (if there is any)? If you see a guy complain that he's ""too nice"" to get women or that they're all into ""Chads"" or similar, it might be a good idea to link him to this video. Nice Guys are salvageable, but they do require education AND a kick in the butt. Trust me on that.",0,0,2018-08-20T13:23:26.000Z

I don't know. i thought more than incels believed in that female mating stragity. humans have a lowsy ablity of knowing   which child they sired, others might be able to smell it. so a human mates with one male with good genes but lowsy fathering skills, and makes a family with the other.

you make it sound like it's a myth human females have smaller brow ridges. that is why it looks like our eyes are bigger. it gives us younger features

and promisuoity got humans to evolve into what we are.

"The history of western philosophy is filled with masochistic epistemology, starting all the way from ""better to be unhappy wise Socrates than a happy dirty pig"" and stoic stuff. I think it was first Nietzsche to question the will of truth as a basis of western morality (and propose a will of power instead). For Nietzsche every epistemology is also a moral system. He argued that the will of truth has been responsible for the ascetic ideals (and transcendental metaphysics) that have long governed the morality in the west.

Most interestingly he claims that this sort of morality borns everytime humans go through stress under ruhtless rulers or physiologically challenging conditions. It is a reactive plan for life to survive in circumstances hostile for life, by turning against life itself. Nietzsche made often natural analogues (like hibernation that some species do in order to survive) to understand this paradoxical behaviour of human morality. Nietzsche, throughout his life as a sick incelish man, knew what he was talking about. There are probably many others ""philcels"" as well.",0,0,2018-08-20T09:56:30.000Z

For the longest time dark skinned women have been the literal bottom of the dating pool, having to hear from family, friends and black men that if we were a little lighter, we'd be attractive. So groups formed, especially on reddit, where dark skinned women would put of pictures of themselves and black women who were just a tiny shade lighter would bash them and encourage bleaching. There were so many videos that went deep on why as a dark skinned women you could never be seen as attractive and the best thing was to put a paper bag on your face.

"It's a very sad community. This rock and roll manosphere you mention at the very end existed for me in the metal music. It was a way to look and act that was very forgiving. Lots of facial features and body structures become acceptable with long hair, beards and a Slayer shirt. Maybe that was my salvation. 

One other thing I'll mention is the puberty angle. At 12-20 you're as horny as you will ever be and it will seem like everyone around you is having sex, but they're not. The episode of Glow when Marc Marrons daughter is revealed to be having more sex than all the other women on the show,  that's more like reality. 

Secondly, as I grew older more body types became attractive to me. I don't think that's just me. Personality also became more important. Honestly, masturbation can be better than some sex you will have in your life. And I'm a man, that's not just a women thing.

Incels make it seem like all women can get any man they want, like women aren't complex individuals with their own feelings, preferences, etc. Finding out what incels think about fat women, wlw, women of color, and etc is just horrible. Women really aren't anything but objects to them, it seems.
I guess my point is that these guys have such a horrible worldview and *need* therapy. They put sex on a pedestal and as such think their life is over because they're virgins.

"I can't help but ask, What's the effing solution?
I talk to girls. Offline, online, apps. I try to strike up conversion at my work, their work, at the grocery store, at the game store, whenever I see a girl that I think looks interesting. Not pretty, or hot, persay, just interesting. They have cool looking hair, an anime thing I recognize, or are in fact pretty and/or hot. But they all go the same, they either ignore me and walk away, or claim to have a boyfriend when I start to ask details, like their name, general area where they live, and if they want to hang out more in future; and I mean, they're either telling the true, to which it would be wrong to try and convents her of adultery, or she's lying and i would be an asshole for harassing further.
Online girls just don't do anything really. I ask a question, they answer. A make a joke, they lol. I make a general statement of something, they don't reply at all. And dating apps don't help.
So what's the solution? And not what I can do, or you can do, because we're just two meat bags on the internet. But what's the solution for the world to fix this problem of men trying and failing while remaining respectful. Because from my view that's the problem of ""The Nice Guy""; they don't disrespect women to their faces until their become assholes. That seems to be the trait the ""chads"" and 'pick up artist' all share, they're assholes. They harass until they win, and I am not going to do that.

Some even refuse to have sex with non-virgin females if given the chance, considering it to be the same as cucking and the ultimate cope. That's part of why they despise feminism so much- feminism has normalized women having sex before marriage and had therefore made it harder fire older men to find virgin wives.",0,0,2018-08-20T03:06:53.000Z

What you miss is that a lack of human contact severely damages the human body and mind. The human body requires physical contact to survive. Natural Selection has determined that absent the social contract this individual no longer has any value to the passing on of relevant genes and thus as put in place ways to slowly kill you. Its why prisoners in solitary confinement are 7x more likely to commit suicide than prisoners in the general prison population. Isolation dramatically increases suicidal ideation and mental illness. I am 100% convinced that the reason male suicides are 4x higher than female suicides are because women have a massively easier time getting intimate sex than men do. They never feel crippling isolation and thus don't understand male depression,0,4,2018-08-20T02:59:33.000Z

Many men see how much attention and access to romance women get from modern society via online dating etc., and naively attempt to proxy that security by switching genders. Only these trans men find themselves caught in a twisted, ostracized, decimated void of a body dejected by both men and women who are fundamentally looking for honest sexual signals.",0,3,2018-08-20T02:54:29.000Z

One thing that kind of baffles me is their blame for how media shaped these women which seems hypocritical because I honestly believe media is partially to blame for shaping the incel beliefs of entitlement to women because of decades of toxic masculinity being portrayed as attractive and the norm, so I was kind of expecting you to maybe touch up on those but already having it in my mind makes me better appreciate that you took it on from a different perspective, more so since I have a sister who's a transwoman so I like learning more about her culture.

"You might not appreciate this but they theorize that trans people are just narcissists who failed at attracting people as one gender so are trying with the other. They call it trannymaxxing and there are in depth theories about it, guides etc. The theory behind this movement can go a variety of ways but the most interesting to me is the ones that take looks to be superior to money and status for attracting a partner, they are basically men who have the same obsession with looks women do. It makes sense that trans women can relate because they're undergoing a similar journey from their perspectives, becoming what one is.

I think men worrying about looks is a positive social trend believe it or not. It is utopian egalitarianism to think that the only thing that should matter is looks for men because it does away with the exchange of sex for status, money and power in patriarchy that radical feminists recognize as underpinning rape culture. Focusing on the eugenicist overtones can reveal a lot but I don't think that's enough to understand what's happening. There are greater structural trends that inform these movements and frankly it comes down to the successes of feminism. It's the democratization of appearance anxiety. Of course we might want it to be done away with all together at some point but at least for now it should be recognized as a promising development, the fascism inherent in it is a product of capitalism in the first place.",2,0,2018-08-20T01:18:13.000Z

"I feel like Incels also get their idea of relationships from various toxic places. 

One of them is porn.

The chad they describe sounds like the description of the kind of guys you see in porn. Most of the male performers look like total douchebags. Since porn is probably the closest they get to seeing a vagina, they probably also took note of the kind of guys that are in these things.

The other is from naive sayings from people who either never been in a relationship, or based the concept of a relationship from fantasy. Garbage like: ""There's someone for everyone,"" gives people a distorted sense of entitlement. No, there isn't someone for everyone. There are plenty of people who ends up being alone for the rest of their life, or ends up in various bad relationships thinking they found the one. Sure, some people can get married, but they still end up being divorced due to various reasons. Some people can marry multiple times and go through multiple divorces, and at the end of the day, what do they have to show for it other than a bunch of mistakes in their life? 

I'm not saying you should throw your hands up and give up. You should still try to find that special person in your life. However, don't live your life believing some fantasy.

"Hi ContraPoints, this was the first video I watched of your channel, and my first thought was, ""Oh here is a woman explaining cultural issues that I am interested in, this is what I need because I only see men talking about these topics."" I've been watching the rest of your channel and it is so helpful. 

I am a government student in postgraduate study, I've struggled for a long time resisting the Jordan Peterson's of the world, mainly because I am academically interested in conservative politics and realism. 

It's a paradox allot people can't seem to understand, that I support progressive politics but focus my study on conservatism, and like, after studying George W. Bush for years I've started to enjoy the guy and feel genuinely sorry for him even though under his watch the whole world went to shit. But often when I try to talk to other people about my ideas and concepts, I get shouted at about neoliberalism called a fascist. 

I grew up on 4chan and have lurked r9k for years writing sociology essays about incels and redpills, but the whole anti-feminism debate, cultural Marxism - whatever - has never interested me. I've always been into hard politics, realism, game theory, nuclear proliferation which seems very right wing to allot of people. I've tried to counterbalance all this by ranting about the danger of climate change to everyone who would listen but even so people would write me off as a fascist and shout at me about neoliberalism. 

Allot of people on the left don't seem to understand that this is entirely unhelpful, I might be a progressive-moderate, but just being shouted all the time makes you feel isolated, resentful of social justice warriors and the left pushing me down the rabbit hole of Jordan Peterson, Pragur-U and Ben Shapiro for a very long time.

Even though I didn't agree with everything they said, I think the content is designed to target people like me specifically. It is easy to take refuge in these men because it looks like a safe place where people outside of mainstream politics can gather. These men focus their discussion on open debates which is so tempting for government students who are scared to talk about politics. The effect of this exposure was to push me away from progressive values and towards this very insidious, sexist and racist form of rightwing politics.

I've been suffering the paradox of feeling marginalised and repressed by capitalism but at the same time brainwashed into thinking that inequality is a good thing and that the free market creates jobs for the working class. Anyway, my form of resisting has been through studying international public health. Shifting my brain from thinking about inequality to measure a state's success through equal access to health care has been very helpful in resisting these men. 

Anyway, I just wanted to say I think you are doing great work with this channel, I love the sets, and I'm going to be recommending you to all my friends.",15,0,2018-08-19T23:53:56.000Z

"The real black-pilled truth is that we're ALL of us in love with pain, death, and suffering to some extent. That's why decent looking men populate the incel forums and post selfies knowing the inevitable result, that's why trans do the same. In truth, the last thing they want is to get laid, they're too in love with their own despair, they're too unconsciously beholden to the fact that all of our virtues can only be measured by their contradistinction to some pain, suffering, or adversity, and their minds, like all ours to some extent, erroneously reason in a sort of backwards mistaken shorthand that pain = virtue, or meaning. What are the Russians supposed to call it, ""being moved by one's own perdition""? well, yeah, we're psychotic apes.
And I think that a lot of these, for lack of a better word, existential issues have become exacerbated in recent years by a technology that removes so much pain, suffering, and adversity from our lives. Formerly, we didn't have to look far for it, but now we seek it out in the most bizarre ways. This is the real universal issue of our age that unites all the other myriad psychosocial dysfuntionalities and pathologies, this is our modern Golgotha.
And perhaps, originally this tendency to negation, this desire to mix the best and the worst impulses together, and this radical malaise we feel when we haven't achieved this, perhaps it originally had a salutary evolutionary function, perhaps that's the only way a sentient species can cope with the existence of pain and suffering and death, so clearly repugnant to the spiritual infinitudes constantly suggested by its ""rational"" mind, perhaps that was the only way to balance it for the early hominids so they wouldn't go insane. But it was an insanity deferred, at best.
It reminds me, like all things online do, of the Inevitable Wachowskis and how in the first movie Agent Smith said that the human mind rejected the first, paradisiacal Matrix.
Well, anyways the best thing we can do is keep soldiering on and try to share some charity and generosity with others, reserving a true humility based in healthy self-love for ourselves. There's no transcendent answer, and the advent of one would actually be the real apocalypse for the being I've been describing.",14,7,2018-08-19T23:03:52.000Z

"A lot of incels are men with anxiety and psychological problems. This impacts men way more when it comes to sexuality. Acquiring sex is much easier for women. Women and feminists don't understand this sort of thing. Women get validated sexually all the time, men have to work for it. Sexuality and human touch is a human need. Which is why they go nutty.

But of course no one gives a fuck about this problem of theirs so they join up together because at least they can empathize with each other.

If incels were majority women, the conversation would be completely different.

Skylars are trans men that have no dysphoria or at least not enough to stop them from wearing feminine clothing, put minimal effort into covering their breasts, hips, etc... and overall will never pass and are viewed as hugboxers by truscum trans guys. I am a trans man with huge hips, almost completely unbindable tits, and a feminine gay disposition and I guess I would qualify as a Skylar by this definition.

"There is a bit of hypocrisy in the existence of incels. Mostly in that straight women and queer people have to deal with rejection too, and aren't massive assholes about it. 

Gonna get personal as an example. So, men have never shown any interest in me. This has understandably made me feel really lonely and isolated growing up. I'm a super romantic person, which made the loneliness worse and all my friends were really pretty and sought after. As a teenager, this catastrophic thinking really fueled my depression too. Still, I NEVER took these feelings out on men or even other girls. It hasn't stopped me from being good friends with guys I had crushes on or the girls they dated. 

I got better with the feelings of isolation by taking time to get to know myself. I've still never dated anyone, but I've never been happier. I spend time with friends, and focus on my interests and ambitions. I think coming to terms that a relationship isn't going to magically fix all of your problems is really important. 

I really wish the best for everyone dealing with this sort of thing and encourage them to not be so catastrophic. There are so many different types of loving relationships that aren't romantic that you may be missing out on because you're wallowing in hatred and self-pity.",87,57,2018-08-19T21:38:14.000Z

And someone responded it was a made up term and I'm pretty sure conflated me with an incel. It was bizarre and infuriating. 
I have suffered from self loathing and anxiety about my looks, thus I've felt like no one will be attracted to me or love me. But at the same time I never really ever had a true desire to engage in sex, though I do have sexual desires. Its just not a huge priority or interest. 
Heck I've never been in relationship and I'm 30. This is not only due to my demisexuality but also just personal hang ups brought on by past trauma. Aka I've had a fear of men. 
And right now I'm just a bit more occupied improving myself and living situation, and just trying to love myself, which is corny but the most apt term I can think of. Its very difficult to engage in love and intimacy when you have just so little love for yourself. But for fuck sakes you can't blame a whole gender for your feelings of self loathing. Sex can be great but yeah I wish people would stop believing its the main thing in life. But thats hard to disbelieve when you're barraged by commercials, movies, tv shows and all kinds of people saying that sex is fantastic and the only thing that matters.

"Sounds about right...Taking miscellaneous facts about life and society and putting them together to fit their narrative. So, someone sees these facts put together to fit a narrative that they WANT to believe is true, and thus now have a justification for their desire to believe something is true. This is not unique, especially on the internet. There's a certain black Youtuber who thinks racism never existed for example, and that people just hated black people for other reasons. You will love the hypocrisy he has in some of his views though...so you can check it out at your own pleasure/peril lol.

Ok, so let's assume everything they say about sex preferences between hetero men and woman are right. What does that prove? ALL it says is that people are shallow when it comes to sex. Yes people, not just woman. That's because things go both ways here - men also have their preferences when it comes to physical attractiveness. In fact, as much as they blame woman for their shallowness when it comes to things like status and bone structure, woman blame men for things like wanting perfect t&a, skin, face and body in general. I'm absolutely positive there are statistically close to as many incel woman due to their physique as there are incel men due to theirs. 

This is all fine by the way, because we can't control who we are attracted to. This is like if gay men were to complain that there aren't enough men to f. If you're in the minority in terms of what people find sexually attractive, that sucks. However, complaining about it and especially making the other seem like they're directly responsible and demonizing them is the absolute worst thing you can do about it. So if you're in the minority in terms of what nature selected for, then you are going to have problems in that area. You can work to change that though, and every once and a while nature doesn't matter as much as luck does. You might get lucky and find another incel on the other side that you find attractive! You can then convince them that you are just as terribad as them, and you two can be happy in your misery together!",2,0,2018-08-19T20:29:40.000Z

That implies the manosphere has a strange, incomplete and contradictory definition of ""alpha"", which excludes the ability to support a household, a traditional measure of masculinity.

"i've never commented on a youtube video before and i'm not a big commenter in general, but i've had some thoughts on this video that won't leave me alone. not sure if you're much of a comment replier but it seemed worthwhile to share my thoughts in case you or someone else might be able to shed light on some things i feel murky about.

as a cis woman who has struggled with body image and beauty norms my whole life, i have to admit that i flinched when you mentioned your plans to get facial feminization surgery. my gut reaction was to think ""what a waste, you're perfect just the way you are!"" obviously i can't relate to the specific experience of gender dysphoria (which you so brilliantly portrayed in a previous video) but i do feel that being dissatisfied with oneself, and particularly with one's appearance, is as fundamental to ""womanhood"" as anything else, and in fact that's part of why i feel that trans women have just as much claim to womanhood as cis women. we are all held to an impossible standard, and some women (trans and cis alike) respond to societal pressures by going to drastic lengths to modify their bodies in the pursuit of obtaining the ""ideal"" female form. and although that's a matter of personal choice it does feel somewhat like a betrayal of women who can't or won't go to the same lengths. (and i think it's worth noting that cosmetic procedures seem very different to me than taking hormones or getting surgeries to modify primary sex characteristics, though i can't quite articulate how.)

so while the better part of me wants to be unequivocally supportive of trans women doing whatever helps them feel more comfortable with their bodies and move through the world more easily, there's still that stubborn [screechy feminist] voice in my head that cries out in dismay i think for too long about the implications of facial feminization surgery. maybe i just need to stop overthinking it and leave people alone who are just trying to make their lives easier by not getting misgendered or harassed at the supermarket. probably.

anyway thanks in advance to anyone who wants to take the time to respond to my dumb opinions and thank you to contrapoints for [always] making me think.",10,4,2018-08-19T18:35:04.000Z

"So two things about incels: they're aiming for the wrong girls and they reek of desperation. 

Girls can usually smell when you're being disingenuous from a mile away. If you set up a date and she thinks it's for a relationship and you're mainly thinking about sex, she can tell and probably won't be interested in a second date. There are plenty of girls who are aromantic and would be up for casual sex. But those aren't the girls Incels want. 

They're also not aiming at girls who they could even hold a conversation with. If your Tinder says that you like video games, golden age comics, and want to be a Twitch streamer maybe stop swiping on the girls in yoga pants who like jogging and traveling. You're probably not gotta get anywhere with her.",150,23,2018-08-19T18:26:22.000Z

I would think that society encourages ""ordinary"" looking men to think they can still marry a model, because I see couples IRL like that all the time! But then again that's from my perspective as a white cis woman who has been rejected and had her heart broken many times before finally finding true love that's going 7 years strong. But my point is it takes a lot of pain and heartbreak for everyone to find love. To think you're special because of your looks so your rejection is more painful than ours is incredibly small-minded (and that's my PG version).",109,31,2018-08-19T18:25:29.000Z

"How to get women as an incel! A 1-step guide:
Step 1: Don't call yourself an Incel.

Think about it, you willingfully identify yourself as someone who no woman wants to fuck. Really? Why not like a musician? Or a science whiz? A creative writer?

"I have written a comment like a thousand times and erased it because I don't know how to connect the many thoughts that resonate on my head after watching this video. Hopefully, this last try is somehow decent.
I identify a lot with what is talked about here, I see the things I used to think about the world at large, and how I viewed myself because of my circumstances. I'm glad I got through some of it, but it's hard to battle the feelings of inadequacy when they seem so unsormountable.
The hardest part about getting out of that late stage of catastrophizing is to lay down and rot is a lot easier than to improve. The fantasy of being forever inadequate because of your physical characteristics is perfect, because it gives you an excuse to say you're unfixable, it lets you trap yourself in a very deep but comfortable hole where you're not happy, but you also don't have to suffer the pain of self-improvement. That's a big part of what the incel communtity, as it's known now, makes it so infectious and unescapable. The idea of a group of people that tell you ""you're a reject, but you can be with other rejects here"" is attractive, it lets you stay in that hole with other people, thinking it's better to isolate yourself and blame others for all your shortcomings than to self reflect and improve.",8,1,2018-08-19T16:27:01.000Z

"When I was younger, I fell into this trap. I was so angry and to be honest if incel forums existed I would have likely joined one. I struggled with mental health and hated the anxiety women gave me and thus I blamed my anxieties on women. I was lucky to come to a conclusion that saved me from falling deeper into misogyny and hatred. You could call it the 'white pill' I guess. Sort of a kinder, gentler version of the black pill with an emphasis on peace with being single rather than loathing because of it. I soon threw that pill up when after focusing on myself for a few years I got asked out by a friend and after a lengthy period of dating, I realized that focusing on improving myself was the only way to be successful in dating. I still have anxiety and I am occasionally socially awkward and cringy, but now I take care of myself and I'm confident enough to ask girls out and go on dates.

"Another great (and necessary) video!

My brother (who's in his 30's) has been influenced by internet forums like these since the late 90's, and our dad shares a similar worldview without the vocab (misogyny, resentment, self-loathing, catastrophizing, all of it really)- despite being married. 

Since I'm not a cis dude (enby here) I don't relate with them entirely, but I definitely have felt big waves of inadequacy, hopelessness, ""cards stacked against me"" etc when it comes to dating. So when the topic of incels comes up in some social justice circles, I feel conflicted. I find the incredible misogyny, rape apologism, and occasional violence abhorrent.... but I also relate to the loneliness, isolation, etc and that feeling ""I've already done everything."" I look at my brother's and father's lives and kind of understand why they feel the way they do, even though their beliefs about women (and themselves) deeply trouble me.

I find the sometimes-mean-spirited advice offered to incels like ""anyone can find a date""/""just get a hobby""/""it's all about confidence""/etc kind of glib and, idk, I don't really buy it? Like part of me wonders if the advice-giver actually understands what that level of rejection feels like, or has taken into account actual trends in dating (and especially app/online dating?). For example - there have been surveys saying some 50% of cis LGBs wouldn't consider dating a trans person. I don't think my dating life is hopeless, and I believe there is (much) more to life than sex and romance, *but*. If someone's gonna give  me advice when I'm feeling low, I really need them to take the actual context of my life (and bias, rejection, isolation, harassment, etc) into consideration, you know?

Final thing... especially when I was younger (I first had internet access in the 90's), I found it really hard to distinguish between a healthy online space for marginalized folks that validated my identity (e.g. some trans forums), versus a self-harmy, sorta-culty, communal-spiral-into-darkness like the incel spaces you describe (or the pro-ana spaces others have brought up).

"incel rubbish had me convinced i was aro ace for years
because if that's what relationships are like, having one is basically immoral
and not one to be immoral, i swore off the concept
the only class i had in school that discussed relationships in any way was astronomy. fucking astronomy, where the teacher wouldn't goddamn shut up about her own sex life and giving people incredibly conservative relationship tips, frequently unasked for and shared with the entire class.
i could have reported her but literally everyone else in the school loved her for this and i wasn't about to become a pariah for stopping the only teacher most people didn't hate.
and her advice largely echoed incel advice. become someone you detest/who bores you, do horrible things. and of course this all echoed messages in entertainment.

actually i tell a lie, AP psychology touched on this. at least the topic belongs in that class. but the teacher still said ""all women want is protection. all men want is youth and beauty. studies have shown this."" and who can argue with the immutable iron truth of *rational* *** s c i e n t i s m ***

(incidentally, if the specific formulation of the above has made you realize ""hey, aren't you the guy who wrote that real shitty incel-adjacent story in the form of a dictionary in form&tech,"" yes, that was me, and i am deeply sorry for making anyone endure that. i know ""i am deeply sorry"" sounds like a cookie cutter fake apology but this seriously haunts me. there are like 20 of you and probably none of you will read this comment, and even if you do you've probably put it out of your mind until now [how i envy you], but an apology needs to be made.)

i am always extremely doubtful when someone says they've always been good on something the general culture is bad on. which is probably not a good way to think because i always found the ""schools are like prisons"" argument meaningless because duhhhh of course they are, use your eyes, why does this need saying? and on a perhaps less childish note, i always thought patriotism was extremely harmful/willfully stupid and was afraid of cops though i couldn't articulate why.

but there is enough faux anti-authoritarianism in media and so much pushing for ""america is free"" from a young age that someone who is a little odd and less bound by social rituals (the same sort of person who might have trouble dating, say) to see through the ruse and call it out. however given how ubiquitous shitty patriarchal relationships are in media, and how everyone is compelled to make their relationship look a certain way to the outside world (not to mention how ubiquitous shitty patriarchal relationships are outside of media, too), i am especially skeptical of any guy who claims to have never been influenced in incel-ish ways. and i hate the implication that anyone who has these beliefs does so because they're just inherently bad people or whatever, when so much constant messaging has been pushing them in this direction.

i used to think that because i disliked the conventional venues for dating (restaurants, movie theaters, all the flavors of sportsball, dances) yet still experienced some sort of attraction that i was this unlovable irredeemable piece of crap because i didn't have any clue what i would replace them with. like i got nothing against a good meal out but it feels like how you would get to know a colleague or someone you intend to keep at arm's length, not someone you could be potentially getting very close to. then for a year or so i thought i was poly. but i stopped believing that because it didn't feel genuine and felt more like... greed? wanting no consequences? looking back it defo was that thing.

so all of this jumping around between ideologies has left me basically spiritually mangled. i cannot deny that i was a horrible person who said some horrible things. i am some manner of sex-repulsed but i cannot say why. there seems to be some level of disgust at fluids and organs and such, but so much of it is self-loathing like it's sinful to even imagine such a thing. and i think the whole thing of going on about mediocre men is not helping anyone's self loathing. i have literally thought that i am a bad ally because i long for some kind of closer-than-friendship connection while not being conventionally attractive. i literally hate what is considered conventionally attractive for men, i think it is boring and restrictive and ties can go fuck off. anyone who claims to like ties is a philosophical zombie and i stand by this stance.

so does this mean i am agender? it doesn't feel quite right. but part of that feels like i am abdicating responsibility, fleeing the man box without breaking it down. like i have some kind of duty to get rid of emotional repression and toxic masculinity and i can't do that from outside the box (though arguably, everyone who creates art/education/rhetoric/media/whatever has the duty to at least not support those things.) it also seems to be... saying that the box is correct, and the only problem is that i don't fit its description.?

there is also a metaphorical aspect that i have not seen anyone talk about really (though i only really read aven and even then, not so much anymore). like i dunno if it was because i was around an abnormally high number of kinksters or if this was just more patriarchy bullshit, but there was always this idea of ""who is dominant in the relationship?"" and like people were all ""i'm progressive women can be dominant"" but there was nary a mention of... yanno, equality? non-hierarchical interactions? so because of this i became a bit morally disgusted with sex because for the longest time the only people i heard discussing it deeper than ""yes, it is a thing that happens"" were all steeped in this dominance bullshit. and also, need i mention it, ""telling it like it is"" -style support of gender norms. x is always attractive, only x is attractive. all mention of sex became a reminder of my failure to live up. it was very tiring. college literature classes were a nightmare. and when x was aggression, it was even worse. like ""all endorsement of sex is endorsement of aggression."" to this day i have trouble separating the mere concept of sexuality from disgusting notions of domination and aggression.

also making fun of incels not taking care of themselves is pretty shitty because as someone who only recently realized yes, i am in fact depressed beyond what anyone should consider reasonable and not just lazy, it's really difficult to find the energy for even basic maintenance tasks like showering, let alone self-improvement, especially when self-improvement is so often framed only as ""become an athlete and anyone else is subhuman,"" i find there is an infinite amount of exercise information out there about How To Get Really Strong For No Reason and very little for ""yo i just wanna avoid heart disease."" obviously this is only one dimension but the obsession with physicality in any place that won't jump to the conclusion of 'you are immoral scum' if you feel sad because you're lonely.

also ""get some hobbies"" hurts when almost everything in the world bores you, like you're defective and the small handful of things you still enjoy don't count. and ""stop wanting the thing you want without offering any idea how to do that or anything else to fill the emotional void in yourself"" can also go die. like if you have no actionable advice, just be kind enough to get someone to a therapist who will say the same thing but also be able to help them pursue such things. most of the places that help with this are progressive liberal at best (see r/menslib, it is pretty okay) and fail to point out how much of the sad, desolate existence incels fear and turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy is a result of capitalism, or at least fail to point it out consistently. instead they tend to deal in ""existence is bad and lonely, that's just the way it is and nothing can fix it, suck it up, i am definitely not supporting toxic man up behaviors or whatever""

can i just say also that masochistic epistemology is a fantastic framing and hopefully now that a prominent lefty has noticed that people who are already in a bad place seek out insults, the entire concept of ""saying men are trash will somehow magically only make you feel bad if you actually are trash"" can go away. (the hand has been tipped. i am a horrible person.)

on the other hand we are all objectively fucked by climate change so you're wrong about pessimism being delusional, despair is literally the only factually correct emotion.

"Low to no sexual success doesn't make a guy an Incel(TM). Nor does it make him entitled or misogynist, or even jealous of ""alphas"", etc. I trace Incel(TM) origins to society's frankly arrogant attitude toward sexually unsuccessful - especially men. Mainstream society seems to think sexual success is the litmus for a guy deserving even the basics of respect or dignity.  It's a reverse 1950s: instead of society slut-shaming women, it's virgin-shaming men. I don't think that's what the Sexual Revolution was supposed to be all about. That revolution really lost its way over the past 50 years, and even longer ago than that.  If you're sick of Incels, then consider that mainstream society once again is irrationally shaming others due to some harmlessly different personal trait (the mainstream has a poor track record of sizing up a person's worth.

"Tinder and all internet dating is problematic because I think for the most part people or at least women anyway aren't attracted to someone by looks alone or maybe its just me? Like I can walk around all day and not see 1 person I find attractive because I don't know them. I only become attracted to someone's looks when I get to know them, hear them talk, how they express themselves, their personality etc. I will see the most conventionally attractive male on tinder and find him not good looking at all! So for me Tinder and all that is just useless. Its extremely rare for me to find someone attractive based on looks alone. I think the best way to meet people is by going to places you enjoy and meeting people that share you're interests. Like even going to the movie theater every other night! You might meet someone who also loves movies and goes all the time. Who knows!

"I apologise if I'm wrong but I can really relate to the whole ""Masochistic epistemology"" thing, and I found that what helped me was compliments that acknowledged parts of what I feared, your face does have some masculine features, but it's really not a bad thing you have the same vibe as like Ruby Rose and other women who are seen as attractive for blending feminine features with stronger masculine features, I've always found you really attractive but it's in a way that I'd call a ""power move"" and commands respect more than invite objectification, I'm genderfluid myself, I get the dysphoria and how it might prevent this but embracing masculine characteristics and subverting them into a ""trim"" for the femininity was really helpful for me.

tl;dr, you have a ""boyish"" masculinity in your face not a grown ass man face and it gives you an androgynous beauty, it does not make you look like a man in a dress, like a female presenting David Bowie.",0,0,2018-08-19T14:44:24.000Z

Positive comments towards non passing trans people from cis or trans people are not hugboxing, they're completely genuine but from people who are capable of seeing the beauty of visibly trans folk. 

The transfems trapped on 4chan are so depressed bcz they think being visibly trans is inherently bad and so interpret positivity as fake hugboxing. most of them will never pass and so the only way they can get better is by realising you can still be pretty and happy with yourself and visibly trans.",0,0,2018-08-19T14:32:37.000Z

"hi! new huge fan here. I was an incel as a teen male before the groups were a thing and it was bad and I can relate to them on a lot of levels. I've experienced dating apps from both sides talking to all genders, so I totally know what you mean and how it feels. interestingly, my roommate is a trans alt model and adult star with lots of friends and fans, but she doesn't believe anyone will ever love her because she's trans and people on dating apps and hookups at bars are all terrible. she creates her own reality by believing the lie she makes up for herself that's perpetuated through fetish sites and chasers. but I know that real guys can love real girls, even if they are trans. and trans me. are definitely people who often deal with the same issues even though they're often very attractive and very masculine. basically what I think I'm saying is: incels, trans people understand your plights, often from multiple angles, we're often lonely, depressed, and suicidal too. If you're looking to leave your violent self-loathing places, there are thousands of tran girls and boys out there who want the same things as you and who want love and sex, but often can't find it because we're a fetish to the general public. don't fetishize us and we could be a big part of the incel helpful solution. Also, hygiene is important no matter what kind of life you want. don't lose hope, find someone who needs love and see how it goes. there are thousands of wonderful trans people out there looking for happiness too.",0,0,2018-08-19T14:13:58.000Z

The red pill concept didn‚Äôt come from the incel community, I believe it came from Cassie J who created a documentary that in turn removed her from the feminist community that she was more than an adamant supporter of prior to.
She coined the term from the Matrix where Neo chose the red pill over the blue, daring to question his beliefs and try to understand the other side, a side that seemed foolish and not worth investigation, or generally to escape ignorance or simplicity.

The name of her documentary became a lightning rod to represent people who disagreed with the current cultural narratives, being extreme female empowerment (by the majority of perspectives I believe).

IE: It‚Äôs half political and half philosophical by nature or origin.

I don‚Äôt know where the black pill started because it was only a matter of time before the pill thing was milked to this point. It‚Äôs nihilism essentially, and blue pill is for normies and people who are feminist by default, trying to support equality.",0,0,2018-08-19T13:19:46.000Z

"I'm just in love with the term ""masochistic epistemology"". What a succinct way to put this phenomenon.
I think it just comes from the simple fact that there is less incentive to lie in an insult to someone than in a compliment. A compliment can come from a place of self-inflating virtue-signaling (I think of people calling someone with frankly hideous birth defects ""gorgeous"" in a way I cannot imagine doesn't feel condescending, as well as the ""hun"" phenomenon) or even the good intention of bringing a smile to someone's face, even if you don't believe in whatever you're saying. An insult, on the other hand, only works if it's honest to some degree, or you perceive it to be honest. It just doesn't work that well to call someone who is clearly a healthy weight fat to try and insult them. Therefore, when looking at what people are saying about you, we think of insults as inherently more honest than compliments, and disregard compliments, even if they're true.

And for the record: I really do honest to god think you're super attractive.",0,1,2018-08-19T12:17:54.000Z

"Being red pilled is nazi code for believing in a jewish/marxist/leftist/feminist conspiracy that supposedly works against straight, white males to destroy western civilization. It's kind of the nazi version of ""woke"" and it's basically a gateway to fascism.  I think it's important to mention how these manosphere communities are used to normalize far right rhetoric and are fertile ground for far right recruitment. That's really the point of cultivating this world view. 

The red pill has also infected the skeptic/atheist community, which used to be about pwning creationists and laughing at ridiculous things religious people say, and now it's about ""exposing"" feminists and cultural marxist conspiracies.",47,19,2018-08-19T11:10:52.000Z

"I mean, a couple thoughts.
1. If women don't want to receive messages like that, then they need to not be the only kind of messages that get responses
2. Incels may be normal looking dudes, but are told they're not by other incels ... and by women. That's the whole problem. I remember when I used to actually give a shit and try I got women telling me I ""looked"" like a rapist, whatever that means, I was accused of beating women by a complete stranger because I ""looked like the kind of guy who did"", and women i was friends with would say stuff like the thought of me in a relationship was gross and they didnt want to think about that. Specifically, I was at a party one time and this chick I had never spoken to before interrupted a conversation I was having to let me know that I was creepy. That's what it's like for them. It's not like it just comes out of nowhere and they just wake up one day and say ""you know What? I'm gonna be an incel from now on"" you just kinda skipped over the part where incels actually can't get dates because of their looks. This isn't behaviour that people are born with.

"I find incels not just depressing, but I also get a 'there but the grace of god' vibe from them. I had a REALLY bad run when it came to dating in my 20s, to the point of ridiculousness - like, me and this girl and who I never got a chance to see because we were always busy and didn't live nearby had a chance to hook up and my FUCKING CAR BROKE DOWN, getting a rare tropical disease that gave me two years of chronic fatigue, everyone I did get on a date with was crazy or stood me up, etc. It made me feel like I was deficient in some way and I was already insecure about being a little overweight, but at that stage I knew nothing about incel culture. I DID adopt some of the ideas of PUA culture and red-pill shit off the back of GamerGate, but I've left that behind me.

If I had found the incels, I worry it would have just sucked me in and taken me over. The last thing I needed was more negative reinforcement, but without realising it I was seeking it out at the time, and there was a massive reservoir of it out there waiting for me. Somehow I dodged the bullet and I'm really grateful I did. It's nice to be able to like yourself.",2,1,2018-08-19T10:27:36.000Z

"I guess I technically fit the definition of an incel. I‚Äôve never had sex, never been in a relationship at all, and my fist kiss was when I was 18. I never blamed women for how miserable and alone I was, bc everyone should have the freedom to fuck who they want. And if they don‚Äôt want me, that‚Äôs just nature filtering out my bad genetics. That‚Äôs how natural selection works. I try to focus on my career and hobbies, but truthfully, I identify with the pain of the incels. The truth is, not everyone will be loved. That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been, and that‚Äôs probably how it always will be. It‚Äôs okay to be saddened by this, but it‚Äôs not okay to blame others for this. It‚Äôs not women‚Äôs fault for not fucking You, it‚Äôs not your fault for being ugly, it‚Äôs just bad luck.",0,1,2018-08-19T10:19:23.000Z
"I'm pretty sure incels were raised in a feminist environment and/or by single mothers.

That said, feminism did make women shittier. Why? Because women are now a protected class, protected from criticism and consequences. You're no longer allowed to criticize any of them for any immoral, irrational, crazy, obscene, irresponsible behavior they might have. They are protected from dealing with the consequences of those as well. You might have a woman who's unhinged and incompetent in your company wreaking havok and any criticism of her behavior will be treated as misogyny and discrimination and who ever spoke up is gonna lose his job and have a discrimination lawsuit to deal with. You can have a crazy promiscuous woman who'll just sleep around and swap boyfriends every five seconds run off with their money and there's a whole system of safety nets in place for any of the kids born from that woman. The list goes on but my point is that women no longer have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. They can just go about their lives and do whatever they want, however they want and never face any of the consequences. They can be toddlers for ever and never have to clean their own mess and have an army of white knights telling them everyday on instagram how amazingly beautiful and kind they are no matter what they look like or how they treat others. There isn't any social pressure on women to do good anymore, they can be as evil as they want, they're women. 

Men have to work hard on their social skills, polish their personality, be physically and mentally healthy, learn a skill so they can make money, be responsible, civilized, intelligent and charming to be seen as valuable and there's a lot of non written rules they have to abide to to be approved by women and by society as whole. Women on the other hand can just be socially awkward, have no personality whatsoever, be physically and mentally unhealthy, be incompetent, in debt, be antisocial screaming banshees, dumb and repulsive and they'll still manage to land a partner and have kids.

Personally I've never been to incel forums because I can come up with my own edgy shit. My hope is that these guys are just learning to stand up for themselves since they've been told never to be angry, to always be nice and to never defend themselves as I'm pretty sure it's what happened.

By personal experience none of the tricks we give incels worked for me. It always happened at times where I had nothing going on in my life, I hadn't showered for a day or two and I was wearing rags with holes in it. (Crust punks have sex right?) Whenever I consciously try to approach a girl, it fails. I only got dates when one of them texted me ""I WANT TO SEEEEE YOUUUUUUUU!~<3"" and when sex happened it was rarely a conscious decision on my part. I think I've been raped more than I actually had sex tbh. That said I still think dating is a mine field where if you blink the wrong way, you suddenly become an unattractive loser in her eyes and she's gonna tell all of her female friends how much of a pathetic loser you are on the way home even if everything seemed fine a millisecond ago. Our brains are very good at selectively suppressing information and denial so I'm gonna do that for sex and dating until I get lucky again and think ""What the?! Oh shit now I remember sex is actually a thing.""",0,0,2018-08-19T10:18:08.000Z

"I'm 14min in and I gotta say this makes me feel more than a little uncomfortable. I mean for starters I don't know how you couldn't feel uncomfortable seeing such naked hatred for women (or any group of humans for that matter). Many of these things are so implausible on the face of it that they would be laughable if you didn't see a bunch of depressed and I guess probably at least somewhat angry guys all taking it very seriously. However there is another big reason I'm uncomfortable too - seeing so much of myself in what is being described.

Not the hate, or the blaming of women or others in general, but the fatalism and hopelessness. at 14:02 there's a series of thoughts displayed that an incel might go through. I've been through 1-5, and then jumped to 10 (sort of).

Women can be big boned. And I still consider myself to be beautiful. I wear my hair long or pinned up so my head won't seem so big, I like my jaw because it tells idiot asshole guys to not fuck with me, and I love my big hands and broad shoulders because unlike other women I can lift and carry really heavy things easily. I'm also rather tall. I'm still a ""naturally born woman"". We come in lots of variety after all. 
You're one of us. Compared to me you're a real looker, which is cool if that's what you want to be. If you want to be less eye-catching, then that's okay too. Some women are like me and don't like dressing up. I never wear makeup, I hate the feel on my skin. But it's totally fine if women love their makeup.

As a species, we desperately want an ironclad theory of our social world, because even if it's awful, at least it's certain.

It is hard too impossible to spin every experience into a positive one, to make it conform to an optimistic ideology.

On the other hand, it's very easy to spin every good experience into a bad one.

Talked to someone? They're just being polite

"The 80/20 rule probably stems from an old OKCupid blogpost that looked at how men and women see each other and found that the women of the site were extremely critical of physical appearance in their ratings. While the male ratings of women tended follow a standard bellcurve the women rated only 20% of men more attractive than average.

The incel thing hits close to home for me. Fur much of my 20s I struggled with a lot of the same issues. Probably 1-5 of that catastrophizing list. I actively worked against blaming women for problems I thought were my own. Being on the spectrum gave me the idea I was romantically doomed and was incredibly shy and felt I wasn't particularly attractive. I felt society was incredibly unfair putting the risk of rejection seemingly on the shoulders on men alone. And kind of hoped I would be found.

Eventually I realized that whenever I did get the courage to ask a woman out my success rate in them agreeing to at least a date was incredibly high. So I put myself out there basically one time on a dating site, messaged 4 girls, 3 got back to me, 2 had conversations, and 1 I have been dating for the last 7 years.

I used to think I'd be so much more a wonderful caring boyfriend than the schmucks I see women date. I now realize, though, I'm a shit boyfriend who is stubborn and emotionally unavailable. I'm glad she puts up with me. :P",0,0,2018-08-19T05:34:23.000Z

"Very beginning of this video reminds me of my cybering days...
Please, don't remind me of those pathetic times ever again.
And what's with eugenics being brought back from extinction. I thought that shit died out decades ago.
Also, I hate myself on a constant basis and I always compare myself to others and always think I'm not good enough. I've also been rejected a lot, having women go so far as tell me they wouldn't date me even if I looked like the guy on the cover of GQ. But I still can't come to the conclusions incels do. 
So I'm fortunate I'm not that fucked up.

"This was interesting. I also have something to add which is while it can seem to men/male people like this type of self hating community is something particular to being in that position in the sexual market place, that‚Äôs entirely false. Look at ‚Äòmeanspo‚Äô and ‚Äòproana‚Äô on tumblr. Incels and TTT communities may be harsh on each other but in similar communities populated by young women we drive each other to the literal death, begging one another to be as cruel as possible. It‚Äôs kind of frustrating because I feel like Incels, an online community populated with young men, raises a lot more alarm in the population and is actually understood quite sympathetically, with lots of people trying to help them, simply because groups of young men more often enact violence on others than themselves. It‚Äôs also more sympathetic because most Incels are average/below average looking, whereas pretty skinny young women are considered to be so sexually privledged that our pains over beauty are nothing but vanity",0,0,2018-08-19T02:55:24.000Z

Everything my trans friends said was filtered through the disdain and mockery of these ""womyn-born womyn."" I started to hate hearing about even their unrelated positive experiences.

"I don't wish to be dismissive of anyone's struggle, but... Do you think that a lot of masculinity derives from a sense of competence? The complaint from an incel about a woman using a purse sparked this in my mind, and I cannot escape the idea that women can use pockets in a more fashionable and useful way than men, given current standards of presentableness.
Think about Batman's utility belt. It held everything he needed, didn't look bad, and was tailored to his current outfit.  Can't some enterprising fashionista craft a belt to match a pants-suit, ball gown, or daily wear to allow anyone to just have what they need without the responsibility of toting what amounts to a wartime medic's satchel everywhere they go.
I am short, heterosextual, male, and tiny-wristed, but I haven't felt unable to relate to a woman since early high school.  Granted, I haven't measured my skull, but it was a birthday present and that would seem impolite. A genuine desire to be helpful, the capacity to solve problems involving some material lack, and common decency in regards to human diginty have allowed me to completely miss this incel movement until the news brought it up.
Current fashion doesn't give women pockets, incels are angry about that (though they would just find something else to be angry about if I understand the mindset), and not being able to help sucks regardless of gender. The utility belt (I'm imagining a soft leather, four pouch as the baseline) could level at least one playing field in this current sex battle.
The rest is just orgasms. Human contact without them is the norm. They can be obtained with the application of WiFi and privacy. Mixing the two... Pockets won't really solve that problem.",0,1,2018-08-19T02:48:35.000Z

"Are Incels angry misanthropes who've been left alone for too long without proper guidance, to the point where they've lost all perspective on what constitutes basic human rights and decency? Absolutely.

Do they also make some valid points about the fact that modern society seems to demonize male sexuality while celebrating female sexuality? About the fact that women's standards _have_ jumped significantly in the last 15 years and that many guys (even non-Incels) have noticed this and checked out of the dating scene altogether? Absolutely.

Nobody is saying that Incels should be catered to; but we're doing ourselves a serious disservice if we decide not to question where the Hell they came from and whether or not we're doing anything to create an environment where they're multiplying (which we are, imo).

"Women definitely like hot guys but they're not nearly as looks oriented as men. Being interesting, witty/funny, successful, accomplished, or talented in some way etc. are much more important to women. They want a man that they're not only attracted to, but also one that they admire. They want a man who has passions and goals that they're working towards. These incels have never developed as people. They've never become the strongest version of themselves or even tried to. They waste their lives in escapism and wonder why they're miserable and alone. It's because they have no purpose. No passions. That is why they're miserable, not because they don't get sex. I have a lot of empathy for them because as men, we've all felt this way at some point. But when you have an isolated community of men and they're all echoing this self defeating bullshit and perpetuating each others delusions then you basically become no better than the fat, purple haired land whales on tumblr bitching about the patriarchy all day.

"You know, when I was in high school I got a huge crush on a boy in my class. This happened pretty early in the first year. I just one day saw him and got so attracted. It took a while for me to notice him because like me he was very shy, and I hadn't really heard him talk. He usually hanged around with a friend of his, as I hanged around with mine. He had this very dark brown hair, almost black. I adored it, maybe because most people here are blond. To me he was the cutest boy I had ever seen, even though I guess he just looked normal to most people. Actually, I bet there are some people in the incel community who have many of the same features as he has. In the first year I think I only saw him wear two different hoodies. I couldn't have cared less. For a year I had a crush on him, drooling after him every day and my friends trying to get me to ask him on a date. But I didn't because I used to be shy beyond belief. I was very insecure and only later realised that I'm actually very beautiful. I just didn't hear that from anyone while growing up, while these days I hear it a bit too often. I feel like I'm the ugly duckling that became a swan. 

Anyway, in the summer break I was afraid he'd meet someone, but to my luck he didn't. Then started the second year, and everyone started to talk about a traditional ball that we would have later that year. Long story short; I gathered some courage, asked this boy to be my pair (via Facebook), almost got a heart attack while doing it, HE SAID YES, I asked him on a date as well, he said yes again. I had never been more proud of myself after daring to do this... We went on dates and to the ball, but never had any chemistry, and neither dared to say or do anything, so we never became anything. We literally didn't know what to talk about to each other, it was awkward. But it was still a nice experience. I like to think that I significantly boosted his self esteem by asking him, and I regret giving up. Years later we met at my work and I told him I wished that I had been less shy, implying that we might've become more. He agreed, also regretting his own shyness. We are both dating other people now. 

I guess my point is that it's useless to wallow in self pity or to think that you're ugly and will never find anyone. There is someone out there who loves the way you look. Even if you have a big nose (I personally like that), weak chin (also like that or at least don't think it makes anyone less attractive) or eyes that are positioned in a way that they make you look tired. Actually, this crush of mine had all of these features. If an incel saw me out partying they'd probably see me as a ""Stacy"". So stop with your 'out of my league' shit, and IMPROVE yourselves! 

Seriously, stop hating women, do something to improve your looks, go out there, see a therapist if you need to, and your situation WILL improve. It's crucial that you get out of your toxic mindset and the community of incels.",129,22,2018-08-19T01:49:40.000Z

I still deal with a lot of rejection while dating, but I keep my chin up. I have the mental clarity to stay positive, but I wonder how many self-proclaimed incels are dealing with depression or another undiagnosed mental disorder.

"Honestly, you hit the nail on the head with Inceldom essentially being a cult. I've started listening to podcasts about cults (Heaven's Gate seems to be a pretty popular one to podcast about), and it was kind of frightening how many times I heard about a cult using a certain technique to keep their members in line, and how goddamn *familiar* it sounded.

It was familiar because I knew about Inceldom a long while before I dove into the cult psychology rabbit hole. It's odd because Inceldom doesn't necessarily have a leader who recruits you, so much as it's just a worldview that stuck to some very self-loathing, hateful people.

One name that comes up frequently on a particular podcast (Parcast's ""Cults"", if you want to listen along) is Robert Jay Lifton, who is a cult psychologist. He listed a few traits of what's called ""Destructive Cults"", that is, cults that hurt themselves or other people. They fit all but one (Mystical Manipulation).

1. Milieu Control - Isolation from society. Incels are encouraged to isolate themselves from other people, and they do this via classifying themselves as incels, and only going to incel sites that validate their worldview.

2. Demand for Purity - The world is, according to incels, divided into good and evil. White and black. Incels and sex-havers. So, it's up to incels to prove that they aren't fuckable, thus passing a kind of reverse purity test.

3. The Cult of Confession - Contra hit upon this in the video with the selfie threads. Incels post pictures of themselves for ""critique"", and they openly reveal things that are viewed as ""flaws"" in Incel Dogma, like wrist size or jawline. These things are encouraged by the group.

4. ""Sacred Science"" - Another obvious one. Incels believe that they are the keepers of the ""truth"", and they are beyond question or disputing. Incels do try to hide this behind pseudo-science and evopsych, but they refuse any sort of correction.

5. Loading the Language - Jargon. Specifically, jargon that dull someone's ability to use their critical thinking skills. If someone is a ""Stacy"" or a ""Chad"", then that's all the incel needs to know, and they don't question about a person further. They know all that they think they need to know, and their thoughts stop there. They don't think critically about people being individuals, but rather just sort them into generic groups and stereotype them.

6. Doctrine Over Person - An incel's personal experiences are subordinate to their ""truth"". A girl rejected you? It's because you have a weak jawline, and not because you asked her out and she just wasn't interested. A girl smiled at you? She must be trying to manipulate you into being her beta cuck and not because she was trying to be kind or she was actually interested in you. Nothing an incel experiences will not be tainted by their worldview. Even if they did get laid.

7. Dispensing of Existence - This is the case with some more extreme incels, like Elliot Rodger. Essentially, some incels literally believe that people (specifically ""Stacies"") are worthy of death for not giving them the sex they feel entitled to. Other Incels believe that they themselves don't have the right to exist, and will either ""lay down and rot"", or think about suicide.

...I think you can tell I've given this a lot of thought.

It's really scary to me how these people are literally part of a cult unlike any we've seen before. They have no leaders, follow no religious doctrine, and any normal looking guy you run into on the street could be one of them and want you dead for no reason other than they think you have somehow denied them something by existing and not bowing to their worldviews. It's a scary world we live in, yo.

Now, I'm not suggesting that these people don't deserve help. In fact, I am encouraging it. A cult's grasp is had to break, as many people can attest to. It takes something massive to get someone out of their clutches, but it takes that person admitting they need help and be willing to take it.",27,0,2018-08-19T01:05:10.000Z

"Here's a personal comment nobody asked about: This video was very hard for me to watch and left me powerless on my bed for a while. I'm not an incel, but I do understand their hatred and depression. Look, I know I'm handsome and funny (if you get to know me), but sometimes it feels like I'm not cut for this world and I will die alone without anyone loving me. Most of the time I feel like I wanna die, then I swallow all this destructive thoughts and try to stand straight, just to be rejected again. It's a bit unpleasant, honestly, and I do understand with sorrow in my heart why people give up and decide to take their own lives... Everyday seems like it's the only way to stop this overwhelming train of self-loathing thoughts.

Anyway, after all this sadness, I just wish you the best in your lives, I really do. Fight everyday to keep your hopes up",0,4,2018-08-19T00:59:50.000Z

"Masochistic Epistemology ---- sounds like an attempt to overcompensate from the opposite (yet equally ineffective) approach to epistemology known as ""wishful thinking"".

People need to realize that while Wishful Thinking is not the way, neither is Masochistic Epistemology. They're trying to get away from wishful thinking by just adjusting the level of convenience that causes something to be perceived as ""true"" from ""convenient"" to ""inconvenient"". But both are making the _same_ mistake of seeing the level of convenience of a notion as being at all RELEVANT to it's truth-value.",0,1,2018-08-19T00:55:19.000Z

"I was an incel, in that a had the hopelessness and self pity. I even did the pick up artist thing for a bit. Somehow though, I managed to avoid blaming women for my lot. Even with the pua thing, I always saw it as just social training wheels, giving me a bit of a push out into the world, and a handful of stock points to talk about and grease the wheels, not a way to manipulate woman into fucking me. 

The pua thing never paid off. Instead I just became an sjw beta cuck soyboy and otherwise just kept surviving. It paid off. I met an awesome person and fell in love. Took 30 years, but it happened. 

You gotta let people have their hopelessness. The fact that it's self fulfilling doesn't make it go away. Support them. Love them. Help them if you can. Don't tell them they're the only one's that can change their lives, like people choose to be hopeless. Being hopeless fucking sucks and the last thing you need when you feel that way is to feel guilty for it, like you're choosing it and ruining other people's day in the process for no reason. 

But giving people their hopelessness is one thing. If you let your powerlessness turn to petty venom and hatred to whole groups on the grounds that they haven't handed you the thing you want, that's pathetic. Misery isn't an excuse for bigotry.",2,0,2018-08-19T00:25:15.000Z

Love is a powerful Thing, but so is The pain that comes with it. I couldnt bear it for some time, and I consider myself lucky to have Friends who kept me from going down The incel path. I think we often overlook how easy it can be to go down paths of hatred and bitterness and self-righteousness, Just because we cant and wont Accept that we're, in this very moment, alone and miserable, and simply cant see that its okay to be that way sometimes. I pity incels, and they should be pitied. You did a great, empathic and careful Job with your Video Girl, im proud of you. Im going to curl Up in my bed and cry myself to sleep now.

"Thank you so much for this insight into your own hell. I really appreciate it, it helped improve my sympathies for trans people in general. And it really hits close to home and therefore really touched me as well.

Now my own story:
I have had avoidant personality disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, extremely low self-esteem and depression as well as social anxiety because of frequent childhood narcissistic abuse that I shouldn't go too much into detail right now.
Therefore I used to be involuntarily celibate and pretty much completely or mostly alone because it was incredibly stressful to be outside and be around people or even talk with them via Skype. I used to think that noone wants me or could care about me and I wouldn't believe women would REALLY want me if they got to know me more.
Therefore I would have been perfect recruiting material for incels, especially when I started using dating Apps and felt rejected in so many ways that I have stopped using them pretty much entirely. The only difference was this: I was also a feminist and continue to be so. My sexual frustration never resulted in an overt hatred of women.

Nowadays my struggle is not anymore with being accepted by women, but with getting close to people. I've realized that i actually got around 1 female love interest each year for the last 4 years, and right now I actually have a few people in my friendship circles who want a relationship with me or have sex with me. I just refuse to do so because I stopped accepting random people who like me just because they like me. I have to like them as well, and so far I neither want a relationship with people that I don't find that interesting nor do I want to have sex with a good female friend of mine, just because I don't consider sex as part of a friendship. Yes, there are actually men who don't jump in bed with any woman just because he can.
I still don't really know my sexual orientation, or when something real develops, but until then I still am kind of involuntarily celibate.",0,0,2018-08-18T23:07:25.000Z

Isn't this just a feature of human society? That we like to converse with familiar people, identify our perceived enemies and share our frustrations.

"I had a very traumatic experience an incel roommate a few years back. No matter what I said I couldn't get through to him. He terrorized and harrassed every single woman close to me. He would even hit on women I was on dates with and lash out at them when he was inevitably rejected. Because I am an empathetic person I stopped bringing home dates (men or women. I was either a Chad or a fag in his eyes, just couldn't win.) because he felt I was lording my supposed dating prowess over him. After a few months of this he'd rant on his facebook wall about men who could date, but squandered it. i.e. me. He lost his virginity in the time we lived together. This changed nothing. He was still miserable, still hated all women, still resented me for not sharing my so-called tactics with him. He didn't believe me when I told him that I'm not tricking women into sleeping with me. This living arrangement was pure hell. He took his own life shortly after turning thirty, just as he always said he would. I guess his 30th was his black pill moment and he just didn't want to live like that. This year-long period of my life fucked me up profoundly. How does a pansexual feminist even begin to relate to these people, to help them? I tried everything I could. I've had to realize and accept over the years that not everyone can be helped. That nothing I did caused him to do what he did. I've begun to move on and date again. It's tragic that incels exist and they live in so much pain, but there's nothing I can or frankly should do for that matter that will improve their situation. I'm just going to live my life, and try to be a light in the world. I want to thank you for making this video.

"I wasn't expecting the portion about digital self harm in this video and it hit me pretty hard. I can relate to it. I am definitely guilty of that and trying desperately to avoid doing it to myself. And it's funny because as a woman, one of the main places I engaged in this type of 'digital self harm' were places like /r/incels and /r/mgtow where they constantly talk about how inferior and worthless women are. And it has ruined any tiny amount of self worth I may have had, and made me hate and doubt myself more than ever before. I don't know if I'll ever be able to see myself as capable or human ever again, and that definitely makes me want to end it. 

Even if I successfully stop visiting these places, all these thoughts that I am a worthless piece of shit evil hole incapable of doing anything good have already seared themselves into my brain and I'll never be able to forget them. Incels undoubtably suffer from that same thing, and I fear that some of them have no hope of ever climbing up out of that hole and feeling okay about themselves. Once you immerse yourself in this shit it stays with you forever and it clouds every single interaction you have with others. I just don't know how people can reach out to them in order to guide them toward the help they need, because I'm sure to them it seems like any offer of help is not genuine and any effort made by others to understand them is hopeless and nobody TRULY understands or cares. It's all just very sad. It seems like all they have is each other, which is even more sad. Commiseration can be good, but I don't think they are capable of helping each other.",132,16,2018-08-18T21:42:30.000Z

"Hey, everybody.  I liked this video I found it thought-provoking.  Thanks ContraPoint; you did a great job (IMHO).  Keep up the good work.

However, I'm confused by the InCel ""manifesto"", zeitgeist, maybe? I don't know what to call it, but, anyway, here's what I find confusing.  I don't understand how InCels rationalize the fact they even exist; I mean, given their conclusion that ""Chads"" do the majority of mating, how do InCels explain that there are any males in the population who aren't ""Chads""; I mean, that's the definition of Darwinian Evolution.  And, if that weren't bad enough, what about their own parents?  That is, I don't want to talk about anyone's mamma, but do they think their moms are ""Stacys"", do they think their dads are ""Chads"", or do they think their fathers were cuckolded and they're just ""ugly Chads"", if they don't think those things, then why do they think it's impossible for them to find mates and settle down?

Don't get me wrong, ContraPoint, your video was quite informative but your vidolog didn't lay those nagging questions to rest for me.  If you find the time out of what must be a crushingly busy schedule surely, please help me out with a short reply.  I'm a heterosexual Animologist (not the ""Furri"" kind) and I don't see women on a regular basis due to paranormal/metaphysical complications but, when I can, I see hookers, all kinds of hookers (legally too); fat hookers, ugly hookers, hookers of all races (just women hookers I think) and, with sex workers available readily, I don't see why InCels have a problem; I mean, I suspect their fathers did; hookers are just like sexual training wheels.  Do InCels think they're above seeking out a prostitute's services, if so, I've got news for them: if you're a make seeking a woman's sexual favors, then you're going to pay for it; that's just how the universe is constructed, it doesn't matter if you're a ""Chad"", a dad, or a PhD grad, if you're a male and you want to play, you're gonna pay.

"Though not as extreme as in some cases I've seen online, in my teenage years I behaved similarly to incels and was one.
In my case, years of being pushed around at school which eventually lead to an inability to communicate with girls made me see women almost as something different than men, as tho theyre not human, not in a demeaning way, but rather not being able to understand that they are beings with feelings and thoughts and personalities just like everyone else.
I remember at times, going out with friends, a group composed of only men, and I would see a guy going out with a friend who was a girl and Id spend a lot of time just wondering ""How does he do it?"" ""How does he talk to her?"" ""What is he saying that makes her be interested in what he has to say?""
I had that almost meme status mindset of ""She talks to me I love her"", because truth be told, just being addressed in a conversation, which is something pretty mundane, was something that never happened and would feel very special.
At the time I had the ideia that you must always be looking for a partner and was unable to accept that you can just be friends with a woman, the only point in having a conversation with one is to find yourself a partner, else she friendzoned you which is bad, drop her, go find another.
Eventually (late teens), I realized the problem was me and i had serious issues, and with some effort, tho harsh at times, I managed to grow out of it and all of these thoughts went away as soon as i started making girl friends, and was able to relate to them, and befriend them.

I never blamed women for my own failings and I believe that's the key point where you go from just depressed and into full on misogyny. I became a better artist, worked on my sense of humor, re-aligned my own personal expectations, self-improvement is the answer. Also, if all you are looking for is sex, that's probably at the root of your entire problem. If you can't get past that, you are the whole of the problem and nothing external is going to solve that. Incels want something they can't have because they are not willing to put in the work and instead of blaming their own effort-shock project that hatred outward.

"""Imagine how a woman feels"".   Ah man.... when I first read that, I thought the person was actually going to consider how women feel.  But apparently he meant how would it feel to have sex with a woman.  I get man, I totally get it.  It would feel good and it's natural to desire that.  But your chances of actually getting it would be many times greater if you took the time to actually consider how women feel.  Here's some things to consider.... women have evolved to choose men who they are attracted to, who have qualities that they desire.  And women evolved to be selective about who they have sex with because they only produce a few eggs in their whole life, and furthermore, historically, pregnancy has actually been quite life threatening.  So evolution made it so women are choosy about who they fuck, and also to repulsed by other qualities.  
They didn't evolve to satisfy your desires.   The fact that you desire them so greatly is pretty much irrelevant to them, in fact, it might even be repulsive.  Basically, men pretty much evolved to satisfy women's desires.  But I don't even mean her sexual desires, I mean her evolutionary needs and want.  Getting sex is the reward for doing so.  It is irrelevant IF she is not attracted to you. The good news is, your small fuckin chin doesn't matter nearly as much as you think.  Women are attracted WAY more to behavior, and how a person carries themselves in general, and moves through life.  Confidence is way more important than your dumb ass chin. , So if you're going through life worried about your stupid chin, that right there is a signal of massive insecurity, which is a way bigger deal than your small chin, so stop worrying about the chin.  SO the good news is that you can work on these qualities that women are attracted.

Having said that, I do agree that women completely ignore some men, and they could just fuckin.... give some guys a break ffs.  Because we live in a world where people do have casual sex, ok?  Sex is not just about reproducing, in fact, it's almost always not about having a kid now.  It's about fun and good health, and women just aren't including a lot of guys.  But..... unfortunately, women don't really care about these guys desires and needs.  They just don't.   And a lot of times, it's not even about attraction, there's a lot of social pressure on women to not get with certain guys, unless he's popular, or there's something about him that is considered particularly desirable.  The idea of just getting with a guy because he's horny and depressed, and she's a little horny is not something society in general, or women care for.  But..... I think they should.  I think it would be good for society.  But..... you can't force anything.  The best I can do is just try to tell people.... look, these guys are fuckin hurtin.  Just go ahead, no one will judge you.  But anyway, the chances of my little pep talk for society to slut it up a bit, probably won't do much.  However, YOU can take action in your own life and become more confident and shit like that.  That is what is going to get you consistent results, instead of a possibly pity lay once in your life.

Having said all that though, I'm not necessarily talking about ""incels"" when I'm talking about the people who deserve sex.   I'm talking about regular guys who are actually decent, nice guys, who just don't get sex much.  That's often not the same thing as the people who call themselves incels.  People who call themselves incels are often so bitter and so hateful that I don't even want ANYTHING to do with them, let alone do I think they deserve sex.  I'm just seeing that in the world, a lot of perfectly decent men are completely ignored, even though there's nothing really wrong with them, and they're not even unattracitive.  They're just not AS attractive as alpha males, so women are just passing them up almost 100% of the time.  I think it's sad and it's kinda ridiculous, and I think women should just include more men in casual fun.  But incels on the other hand..... I kinda hate them.  I hate them because they've stigmatized the idea of not getting laid to become synonymous with total hateful loser, who is possibly on the verge of killing everyone.  That's not a typical sexually frustrated man.  I think incels make it harder for average people to get anything because now as soon as a man expresses any kind of sexual frustration at all, he get labelled incel, which is basically.... a terrible thing to be associated with.

The problem with my argument here is that I am making a logical point, and women don't respond to logic.  I am basically saying, ""cmon, just do it, it would be good for the guy, it would be good for everyone, and you would enjoy it to"".   Nah, that doesn't fly with women.  Tell you what though, I bet if kissing nice guys became a cultural phenomenon, then all of a sudden you would have women flocking to under appreciated men.  If someone made a movie, or a song that somehow made it seem cool to give sexual attention to average guys, then women would gladly do it all the time.  Right now, we have the friendzone anthem.  But I bet if there was a movie out or something that made people think that friends are actually cool and made people think, ""oh, you know what.... friends actually ARE valuable.  Let's show them some love"".  But now all society can think about is this friend zone anthem where this woman just endlessly rejects this poor guy who loves her, no matter what he does.  The song says, ""we're nothing more than friends""...... like that's not good enough.  It _is_ enough, I think.  Not saying I demand the attention, or it is always good enough.... but it's like right now, female sexual power is so ridiculously out of whack, it's like a friend is NEVER enough and even the thought of it is just out of the question.  I just think it's too much.

I mean, think about it.... why isn't it enough to be a friend?  aka, just an average decent guy?  I figure if you are part of society, and you're not an asshole, you _should_ be having sex.  Like what is the problem?  If you contribute to the world, why are you not worthy of casual sex?  Never mind reproducing.  Or, you know what, never mind the sex.  What about just making out? If sex is too much responsibility, kissing and touching isn't.... right?  Sorry to ask the question, but women _are_ the gatekeepers of sex, they are the only ones that can be asked this question.

Pffffff.... anyway, that's just my logical opinion on the subject.  Really the most important thing is to become as attractive as possible",24,79,2018-08-18T19:32:12.000Z

These guys are so obsessed with hierarchy! I guess they need that for the world to make sense.

"Honestly think we look for abusive comments as an unhealthy way of doing something ironically healthy.  I don't think I could have got over some of my self loathing without amplifying it and fully exploring it.  One outcome of wading fully into self hatred can be that you get so used to the language of it that it loses some power when you repeat self hating beliefs.  I think shame and self hate is empowered by a belief or hope that the self hating language we use isn't true, and that's why, to some, the reinforcement of ""everything you believe about yourself is true"" can be useful.  You need to learn who *you* are, not who you're programmed to be ashamed of not being, and I think fully embracing your inability to be that person can help some people.  Unfortunately, this cure seems to be worse than the disease for others.  Perhaps there should be some kind of pagan burial ritual we can call on to mourn that invented ghost, and maybe it would help some people move on.",4,0,2018-08-18T18:44:14.000Z

"I had previously posted years ago on your videos that I cannot stand you. This functionally changed every bit of that. I think part of it is that I have opened more, but most of it is that you are far better at explaining your view with combined common sense and related subjects, as well as the hard research you've been known for. What's interesting is to see this humanity in you that I remember not seeing in your work before.

I've recently found myself in this position of sharing certain ideologies about myself as incels do, though I've never engaged with these groups at all. In fact, in 35 minutes, you quite easily confirmed my suspicion that I have male friends who are definitely incel-material, if not already secretly part of those communities. I also tend to sympathize and seek out these guys as dates or partners, maybe because I feel that misery loves company. You not only made it clear to me that I do think this way, that it's both unacceptable but understandable based on my obsessive focus on a limited set of experiences and extrapolations to catastrophe, but also that I really need to disconnect from people I use to shape my self-perception in this way. I'm not blaming my mother, sister, certain friends or past partners, but I think I've internalized a lot of misandry at myself and a lot of self-admonishment around physical and mental attractiveness and ""compatibility"". These people provide an endless stream of comments that I readily fashion into reinforcements for my own self-""incel-dom"".

I want to thank you for making this video. I also want to point out that I think the MRA-movement needs to do a better job of distinguishing the misogyny from discussions focused on issues affecting men. It's turned into a glossed slope, where one person, like myself, can start out wanting to be active to reduce male suicide, substance abuse and self-harm, yet over time find ourselves internalizing tolerance for broadly misogynistic, cult-like mentalities, simply because we can get there in multiple small steps of empathy. For example, one of my closest (and soon-to-be not) friends is someone I've paid ear-service to for rants on women reflective of incels' comments, rather than make it clear to him that it's his philosophy on relationships which is ultimately incompatible with most women. I've even openly suggested allowing him to use me for sexual release. How absurd that I would not only allow but *crave* to have a ""friend"" use my body as his stress release/receptacle for a ridiculous, self-imposed sexual frustration with women?

Worse, I see similar behaviours (though far less pronounced) in myself: I justify smoking cigarettes as a defence against ""judgmental people""; I justify not exercising as a defence against ""vain people""; I deliberately avoid watching films like Call Me By Your Name or Love, Simon because I obsess over how I could never be physically attractive enough, or financially well-off enough, or have enough achievements/certificates/degrees to be good enough to experience desirability in someone for me. These all ""prime"" me for being an incel, like getting an e-meter reading is one step in the door for Scientology.

You're right, though. If I don't disconnect and make a willful effort to accept my appearance or work deliberately to improve it where I am dissatisfied and have control, I will continue self-loathing and eventually find myself (again) on the phone to a ""sui hotline."" Similarly, I've known there's a reason I can't listen to Antony and the Johnsons anymore but I'm suddenly realizing that it's not because I have better things today than I did then, but that I don't want to look at myself as a fixed result that equates to ""fail"" in many socially important areas of life.",23,5,2018-08-18T17:56:03.000Z

"Three things that really annoy me about these guys. First, why form your entire identity around not being able to get a date? Okay, you're unattractive... but what are you, besides that? Or is that the only thing in your life that's worth mentioning? The one your entire existence revolves around? 

Second, notice how the archetype they simultaneously idolize and despise, this ''Chad'', has no meaningful, lasting relationships... only inconsequential sex. What does that tell you about them? They don't want love or relationships that they complain about not being able to get - they want to be Chad. Which brings me to the third point.

They see the world in a ludicrously black and white manner: to them, the only people that exist are Chads and incels. Let alone the fact that in reality such people barely exist: Chads, as described by them barely make up a tiny percentage of ''alpha'' males, and incels barely make up a tiny percentage of ''omega'' males; the rest (over 99%) are just... normal people. And even with those who more or less fit their archetypes (of whom I've barely met a handful in my entire life), things are usually more complex than they seem on the surface. The ''Chads'' actually tend to be emotional and vulnerable once you befriend them and they let go of the ''image'', and the ''incels'' usually end up being extremely isolated due to early childhood problems like parental neglect and/or harassment, and not genetics and ''skulls''.

"You know what's fucking *weird*?

There's no way I would have found out about Contra if it weren't for online/twitter culture. I feel it's the space where this kind of channel gets the most air to breathe. And even though living in that space means that every incentive is pushing me towards hating her (because I'm center-right), I just adore this channel. Feels like every argument is built on good faith, every bit written with love and every video given the utmost care and attention.

I find that whenever people in different political islands start showing any semblance of good will towards the other, it's only a matter of time before the differences become intolerable (Eiynah and Christopher Picciolini's recent disparaging of Sam Harris comes to mind) - unless one of the parties moves towards the other's political orientation (which is what happened to David Sherratt). But with Contra, this just doesn't seem to happen. Watching her videos doesn't necessarily change my political opinion (although I'm sure it does that to many others), just seems to make it more robust and widen my worldview. I think our discourse desperately needs more people of this sort. Even Sargon doesn't dislike her (from what I've seen, at least).

"I'm always surprised by how neutral you can be talking about things most people on your side of the political compass regard with nothing but hatred. I lost my virginity at 23 and while I never identified as an incel because I never went on incel forums, I still ended up basically being blackpilled by my own brain. It's a scary place to be, and it's never approached with the care it deserves by most people talking about the subject.

That said I don't see how Jordan Peterson is a sexist old man, I've never seen any evidence to suggest that. I'm not even a member of the cult of Jordan Peterson, I've disagreed with him before, but there's nothing about him that's inherently sexist. All he's really done is act as a father figure for a generation of boys who never had one.",0,0,2018-08-18T15:12:13.000Z

"Elliot Rodger's problem was that he had a sexual obsession with his step-mother and Asian concepts of the superiority of the eldest son in the family environment. He frequently makes lascivious references to his step-mother and no doubt, other women were not as interesting to him as she was, except perhaps those in magazines and porn sites (which is kinda what these dudes seem to be displaying). 
They are aiming too high because they feel these 'perfect-looking' women are the only surrogate for the woman really want - who is likely unobtainable due to social norms (a friend's mother, a hot cousin, a teacher etc). What better surrogate for an unobtainable woman than unobtainable women (plural).
Their abject despair and lack of hope, unwillingness to alter and improve their appearance - that's what doesn't make sense. They've made a pride movement that reinforces their lack of pride - much like 'White Privlege' spouting white kids. Self-destructive.... guilt-based!!
Which further adds to the idea that the problem is that they are in love with one particular individual who they really shouldn't be thinking about in that way.

"I have no idea how this got into my feed but it is interesting. Simply because I did not know anything about this and usually try to stay out of the loop of the divide and conquer spectrum in society. Actually, I try to stay out of everything in society that leads to destroying the connection to the true self. But after watching this I wonder what others would consider me as in the divide and conquer paradigm. About 2 years back I had a spiritual awakening that woke me up to all sorts of things. Before that, I was in all kinds of different relationships getting used, walked on lied to and manipulated. That is only the women who would actually date me, many others said I was to short at 5'7 and at that time I was also overweight until I went on my spiritual path and lost over 100 pounds. However, at age 42, I am in the best health I have been in my life and now weigh the same weight I did when I was 16, 142 pounds. The only difference is on this path I see things for what they are just as I see much of society is fake even when it comes to relationships. Now before I went on my path and as I was losing the weight the next thing I heard from women is ""sorry you don't have enough money"". But to me, that is one of the reasons I say much of society is fake. You see if it was really about love it wouldn't be about money if it was truly about love the woman or the man would live in a cardboard box together if need be. So I realized love was even fake these days not all but most. When love is determined by height, money, materialism, package size among other things there is no love to be found and it will end up temporary just as any other thing based on materialism, lust, and money. However, on this spiritual path, I am on, it helped me in many ways one of which is totally wiping all sexual urges from myself. I guess one could say meditation can do wonders for many things that need to be controlled for one's own benefit. I once was a pile of goo before I went on this path, never understanding why things happened as they did. Especially when I was raised up to a be a faithful romantic guy. But little did I know that also equaled outlawed things today such as being a nice guy. Now don't get me wrong when I say nice I don't mean some fairy godfather floating at you on your beck and whim. I always put my foot down when I didn't agree with something and never had a problem standing up for myself. But a lot of times when I did it was already too late she expected a guy to be walked on not one that stood up for himself and it would be over as she moved onto the next boy toy. Today I am very happy being alone, no need or want of sex chasing, or trying to change myself just for another woman to discard me. It is nice knowing my own self and not having to change how I talk or watch what I say, or having to put on some facade just to get a date. Money tends to be a big issue today in relationships and for me, all I can say is if one is ruled by a paper god that is who they are in a relationship with from the start. There is no sense in false promises or false love if ones true love is only the paper god. Now despite my views it does not make me a hateful person because if I was I would be contradicting my own path. When I look at a woman I can see beauty, if she is just beautiful on the outside and not in the inside she is ugly but still a spiritual creature that should still be respected. If she is average on the outside and beautiful on the inside then she could easily be a goddess which is far few in between. So when I look at a woman I can see beauty but there is no lust or any attachment of what is between her legs,actually there is no attachment at all. I treat women with respect if they treat me the same that is equality is it not?. I just have no need to date anymore or to lower my spiritual self to a lower consciousness. Especially after knowing what it was like to be in that lower consciousness for so many years. In my world, I have nothing against women or transgendered or anyone for that matter. I will talk and be friends with anyone as long as they are with me, if not I just don't talk or get caught up with all the divides that are plaguing mankind simply to keep their consciousness on a lower level.",0,0,2018-08-18T14:33:59.000Z

"Part of me wonders if it's our own culture that puts these gross expectations on us?  When those expectations aren't met people get upset.  I think the crux of what I'm understanding is that these incels don't want to put in the effort to be successful, and just have shit handed to them like their parents seemingly did.  I think the rise of online dating made it worse, because in truth the people who use online dating aren't representing themselves realistically, everyone shoots for the stars and would never settle.

I'll admit I nearly fell into this trap in my 20s, but the reality is that I was a poor, fat, nerdy, mixed race dude in a shitty country town (I'm talking full on Trump train here).  OF COURSE dating was going to be brutal, but you know what?  All that can change if you put in the effort to drop most of the weight, game less, find a career (granted it put me in debt) and work on something that makes you ""desirable"" in the dating scene... maybe if someone told these dudes that all relationships is a give and take affair, if you have nothing to offer people won't take you.  That is the reality of relationships, and it's not a bad thing.  I mean, who would want to be in a relationship where you do everything while the partner sits and whines all the time?  I've had to actually turn down my fair share of women when I learn the relationship was going to be me doing all the work and support while she thought she could quit her job and just raise her kids.  It sucks to end things this way, but it's not healthy for both parties.  I know what it's like to be taken advantage of, but there's plenty of fish in the sea, even if the sea tends to be... dirty sometimes.

If someone rejects you for superficial reasons, maybe they're not worth crying over?  I knew people who married for superficial reasons crying on FB when shit went south years later.  Hell, there are happily married people WHO CHEAT on each other... nothing's sacred anymore, that's the beauty of socializing, you learn things you never thought were possible when you live your life in an internet echo chamber.  Also being in a relationship means you have to go beyond your mantra of ME, ME, ME... this goes for both genders FYI, the incels have a ME, ME, ME mentality when it comes to what they want and lack of what they offer.

Which is rather ironic, because they're becoming the very thing they claim to hate.  Also many of them are huuuuuge bigots, that's why I got out of those circles long ago.  I mean, can you believe these idiots are terrified that the love of their life may of had sex with a black guy at some point?  God for bid, had a kid with him?  To the incels she might as well be feral. This is a small part of why ""toxic masculinity"" has been quite the buzzword this past few years.",2,0,2018-08-18T14:18:38.000Z

"Interesting and informative, thank you. Well worth cringing my way through the first few minutes; that vocabulary is astonishingly horrible. I do have some similar sympathies with the incel guys, being in a position similar to theirs myself for various personal reasons. I've never been much inclined to seek out those sections of the culture though, so it's good to be able to do so second hand.

I think I've said it before, but thanks for reading this stuff so I don't have to.

I found it interesting that you seem to suggest that the incel phenomenon is in some way pathological, that if not a mental illness in its own right, it is at least a culture centered on several connected illnesses. People do tend to pathologise ideas they disagree with, but similarly there's pushback against that tendency, and the tension doesn't always cause the general perception to be accurate. Do you think that the solution to this issue, if there is one, is similar to the approaches we've taken to things like anorexia?

And the argot language they invent serves the purpose of codifying this currency, turning it from a vague feeling to something they feel they can measure in thrmselves and others.

"Fucking amazing as usual, Contra!

Also - and I'm not entirely sure why I'm writing this - I'm someone who had the misfortune to be around for the early incel reddit days. Reddit moves quickly, so I'm talking about four years ago before the official main incel subreddit was taken down. It seemed to really take off on reddit before it hit YouTube. There's a few things I've noticed over the years, and what a journey it has been (some of this might be info of interest for my fellow ""normies"", some of it's directed at incels reading these comments):

- Originally, the incels sub was very strictly about not being able to get women, how all incels are ugly (according to themselves), and how unfair it is with hypergamy and Chads and all that jazz. It seemed very much to me that most incels took their worldview directly from the Red Pill sub, including the hypergamy and Chad bullshit, and for that - I blame you, moderators of that sub. You definitely kicked off their worldview and then complained when every incel inundated your sub once their own sub was banned. The blame could arguably most heavily lie on your shoulders, former Republican Representative Robert Fisher, for designing this warped, fucked-up world view based on your own idea of turning Brave New World into an internet cult to get popularity. You birthed The Red Pill, you gave rise to the idea that incels are somehow a thing. I'll also always remember the specific moderators who assisted you since the beginning - and changing your usernames hasn't worked. It's still clear who is who.

- On every occasion when incels have released their pictures, I've never seen one photo of an ugly guy. Ever. And I'm a tall woman who's dated shorter guys, so don't start up with your heightcel bullshit.

- To incels still reading, I'm old enough to be your mother. And I'm old enough to remember specific suicides from various incels. You didn't believe me then and you won't now, but each suicide really fucking shook me up and it's not something I want. It's not something anyone wants. Oh, and while we're talking about mothers...yes, it IS unfair of any incel to demand sex from a mother, sister or cousin. Stop listening to fellow incels telling you that you just need to guilt your female relatives harder. Because, as we've seen in one memorable case, when your sister is your ONLY lifeline and financially supports you, constant attempts to rape her mean she will move out eventually. I know I can't appeal to any angry incels' sense of compassion about how fucked up it is to constantly attempt to rape someone (and a sibling at that), but look at it this way: once this lifeline is gone, you have no money and no one to get your groceries.

- The incels sub (truecels particularly) changed about two years ago. It became less about ""we can't get women"" and more about ""all women are ugly whores who should be raped and mutilated, and most men are very good-looking: let's post photos of hot guys!"" I'm assuming some incels are closeted, in which case - get out of the fucking closet, get off the internet and go get some. You can do it. For the rest: if you're really convinced that women are ugly and men are naturally good-looking, you shouldn't feel any rage about not having sex with something you find disgusting. I know most logic is opposed by a lot of angry incels, but I feel like this logic is hard to argue against. So ignore women and get a hobby that's not just gaming. That thing that you think you might secretly be good at? You probably are good at it, so just practice and do that. You've got nothing to lose. Just get off the sub. Because I don't think you've realized it's just a really horror-themed meme. How could it be true four years ago that women are hot and you can't get one, then true two years ago (and now) that all women are ugly and you don't want them? It's moving a bit thematically, right? Almost like... how Pepe was once awesome and now he's lame, at least according to the incels sub. You're being had, you're being.... ""meme-trolled' by your own members. And we all know the sub's shifting narrative means something else you currently don't believe in will be the new trend in two year's time, and if you're still on that sub you'll somehow believe that's true in two year's time. Yet you don't believe it now. And strangely, each new sub theme contradicts the last theme. So... ask yourself, incels: who's trolling you? It's not normies.

- And for any hard-core long-term incels that have researched and read everything incel-related (I know you're out there), you might remember the story of the girl who got into an arranged marriage with an incel. It was posted when I saw it on the blue pill sub about a year ago. For those who remember it: remember how this marriage went? She was willing to have sex with him, and he.... didn't want to do it. Ever. And that marriage died without him attempting ONCE to have sex with a woman he was married to for two years. He wanted to know her every movement, yeah, and he insisted she pee with the door open so he could see her from where he sat on the couch... but all he did was play video games. Half of you will say she was probably ugly because all women are, so he had no choice. The other half... what happened here? Is it possible that something else rather than ""the woman is the problem"" was at play? I'm betting he was suffering from severe depression that wasn't made better from surfing the incels subs and playing video games all day. And for those who think this story is a lie? Well, the ones who can remember that story would find it very, very hard to deny the truth of her story. It was too involved, too forthcoming with details, too credible. And it was threatening enough to the incels mod to harass her and force her off reddit. Because it threatens the in-group narrative. So I don't have a link to that story - it was blacklisted and she deleted her account and all her history. Just ask WHY and incels mod would do this. You're being duped - not by society, but those who you think are your friends.

And none of you are ugly, by the way.",0,0,2018-08-18T13:01:26.000Z

"I feel that one issue you haven't addressed here is that this loneliness is not driven by sexual frustration, but by a lack of companionship. For most people being unable to find a romantic partner is far more psychologically pressing than being unable to fuck. I would bet money that this sexual frustration and a good chunk of the rage directed at the sexual marketplace is borne out of a lack of any human physical interaction at all, let alone sex. Incel is used as a byeord for their loneliness, not the fact that they cant get their dick wet.

Its also worth mentioning that it's an attractive ideology to people in this situation because there is some truth to it. Women are more hypergamous than men. Attractive people are treated better by almost everyone. The incel and red pill communities extrapolate from some truth to create an all-encompassing worldview that is a caricature of reality, but it's one that they can identify their place in.

Other than that I thought that this was a very well made video, if not the best on the topic.

One final note, while MRAs will be more prone to misogyny than other communities, they are far less prone than other parts of the manosphere you've described. For MRAs it comes from resentment towards injustice, in the same way the really radical feminists will often hate men. 

For anyone who can't sympathise with incels and see them as monsters, I would ask you to put yourself in a situation where you feel your looks are inadequate, you have received no romantic or sexual interest for a long time (if ever) and you feel you have no hope of ever escaping this hell.

In my case this made my whole world view toxic,  every achievement and every step forward in my life was overshadowed by my ""flaws"". 
the truth was that I was to harsh on myself and my surroundings. I couldnt compete with a fictional ideal man, as that man would change at any given notice and was perfect in all aspects. I just couldnt. I turned my attention elsewhere, I started socializing and helping people in my surroundings so I could move away from my own doubts and fears. On that path I learned alot about myself and I saw that even if I thought myself useless other people saw me as a good person.

"I'm really glad I became an adult before social media really was a thing. When I was a depressed teenager I had some of the same thoughts, but luckily I couldn't become a member of an online society of similarily depressed and sexually frustrated teens who would validate my depressive delusions. Building an identity on the idea that you're doomed to never find love is not only dangerous but possibly self fulfilling. Thinking that way makes you really unapproachable and unappealing. 
What ""cured"" me in the end was partly growing up, and partly conciously deciding that I don't have to desperately seek relationships. I can satisfy myself sexually perfectly well on my own when I need to, and I should just try to have fun and make friends the rest of the time and be myself. When I finally met someone, I was not in anyway trying to behave attractively, I was just sat and sang metal lyrics (that I barely knew) to myself if I felt like it, wearing whatever I felt was comfortable, not caring whatever anyone thought. A woman (who is now my wife)  found me interresting and took me on a date (well, she more or less just grabbed me and said let's go somewhere else) and we've been together ever since. 

I now see how my needy, desperate and horny behavior as a teen must have been really repulsive; while my carefree and more playful attitude later must have seemed confident. I mean; I think I wore cargo shorts, a wrinkled shirt and a woolen sweater, wool socks and sandals at the time I met her. And I wasn't really dressing as a slob either, though it might sound like that. I wore colorful patterned shirts etc., I just ignored any rules of fashion in general. Doing your own thing (even if it's weird and if you don't seem embarrased about it), looks like confidence. I probably weren't as confident as I looked back then; it was probably more that I've given up trying and just decided nothing really matters that much than genuine confidence; but it doesn't matter. At least I didn't look uncomfortable and desperate.

It's really a cliche, but it's true: it's better not trying to hard, just relax and wait and enjoy yourself in the mean time. If you try to just enjoy life, the worst that could happen is that you stay single but still have a joyful life anyway; and qute likely you won't stay single for ever anyway if you just are yourself, have fun and meet people.

If you cultivate your depressive desperation like the ""incels"" do, the best that could happen is that you stay desperate, depressed and alone (unless somehow grow out of it and stop thinking that way); and the worst that could happen is you become suicidal.",112,3,2018-08-18T11:36:09.000Z
"They really want to believe that not getting romantic attention is a form of oppression or exploitation, which it is not no matter how bad it feels. Self-improvement really is the only solution.

If they really cared about solving this issue they would be coming together as a community to help each other develop social skills, give positive feedback to others on how to improve appearance, or sharing resources on finding treatment for their mental issues. 

I really think there should be public programs to help people like this (the things I mentioned, not state-issued girlfriends) because these toxic communities are only making the problem worse.",3,0,2018-08-18T11:34:37.000Z

"I used to sink into 4chan and Reddit and just essentially become the life. Everything was just revolving around whatever depraved self-destructive idea I could think up.

You could literally feel the stress and the flood of testosterone destroying your ability to be self-critical or empathetic, because essentially all you wanted was that rush of hatred and satisfaction of either hurting someone else's position through egoism or indulge in whatever emotion you felt you needed at that time... usually negative.

It becomes addictive because it's completely internalised and you can sever your link to the outside world doing it. Of course anything negative thrown your way only fuelled it more, and so you'd end up in 50 threads of arguing over absolutely nothing and ultimately trying to invoke the most hateful insults toward the person to make them feel as shitty as possible.

There was no peer like jibes meant to merely bounce off as playful banter. This was a knife fight in the back alley of the internet. Really it did nothing to help me. It just distorted reality for me. And really it's only because i'm self-reflective enough to realise what it was doing, and lucky enough that I didn't stay in that circumstance for long enough that I managed to get out of it.

"Incels are part of a larger movement to oppose society in general. Perhaps the original publicly known version of this was Diogenes of Sinope, who considered society hopelessly corrupt and in need of tearing down (and remaking). All of this culture can be boiled down to Cynicism, whose purpose is to destroy society and remake it.

Although incels are part of the political right, Diogenes himself was profoundly Leftist, and Anarchist in the modern sense. It's a ridiculous mistake to consider the left and the right on a line, as if either are closer to the center than they are to each other. Diogenes and Incels are quite close, despite their differing political goals.

Diogenes and the modern Anarchists and Incels agree that society should be destroyed. Where they differ is on the nature of the reconstruction. Incels would create a horrific patriarchal world, with strict controls placed on women due to how ""terrible they were before the revolution"".

Political moderates find themselves attacked by both the left and the right because they absolutely do not want society to be destroyed. To them, the tragedy would be the destruction itself.",0,1,2018-08-18T10:59:57.000Z

"Natalie focus too much on looks and men vs females bullshit. Shitposting.

The true incel experience is about the crushing alienation from not being able to relate to the experiences of your peers, parents, grandparents, siblings etc, because you've been a shutin for most of your life. The feeling of inferiority when you hear about all the cool shit others have done that you haven't and how you try to come up with something interesting from your life to tell but simply can't. How awkward it is being questioned about your life and that 4-year hole in your resume when you were too fucking mentally ill and exhausted to do anything. How pathetic it is that the only time you went out for a drink was with your own mother at the age of 24. How you've been robbed of your teenage years, literally wasting them in front of a computer screen to avoid social interaction. How you've never been invited to party as an adult and how your last rl friendship ended more than a decade ago. How you lie awake at night and indulge in fantasies about what having friends would be like and all the fun things you would do if you had any. How your crushing depression leaves you dependent on your parents good will and how you've given up all hope for a partner, friends, and happiness ever. How the prospect of suicide slowly turns into a comfort into the only realistic endpoint. How culture is saturated with romance, relationships, friendship and all these wonderful things you know deep in your soul you will never get to experience. All you can do is watching others flaunting theirs.

"I don't know how to start this off but here goes nothing.
I'd also like to add a bit to your experience of /lgbt/, albeit from a different perspective.
I'm a 16 year old transgirl exclusively attracted to men, something people would refer to as an ""HSTS"". As I started using the board when I was 14 or 15 I had a ton of anxiety suddenly thinking I was AGP and only meta-attracted to men and all of the dissections of pictures and honposting (Which was still allowed on the board back then, nowadays you can only post selfies to be rated on /soc/, so no more ""Could I Pass?"" or ""Do I Pass?"" Threads), that however changed. I visit the board a lot, daily. It's become a habit of mine to check the board at least once a day, usually a lot more than that; ontop of which I am also *very* active on Discord servers that spawned from /tttt/. It is the definition of a mixed bag to me. Knowing that I am HSTS has often times given me a feeling of superiority, that I'm better than others. I am transitioning earlier, I will pass better, I am more legitimate. This feeling is sometimes amplified when I occasionally talk to other early transitioners. However the negative aspects have also scared me greatly. I am unwilling to talk to anyone that transitioned past the age of 30 and you better look good if you transitioned past 25 or even 20. I immediately dismiss older or bad looking transwomen as AGP and think of them in horrible ways. All because they don't look good. My boyfriend has asked me to stop looking at the board and I know that it makes me think in bad ways, but both the negative posts that fuel dysphoria and seeing other people worse off than me so I can feel better about myself have really turned it into a vicious cycle.",0,0,2018-08-18T09:52:10.000Z

"Your video was very informative and I hope it helps somebody that is/was an incel. It's strange I love your videos but typically find one point divorced from the main point I disagree with. In this case it's your conflation of Men's Rights Activists and Incels/Redpillers in general. Now I'm not saying that there is no MRA that's a redpiller. I'm sure there's some overlap. However that isn't the core philosophy I've seen from MRAs. Which is simply that western society has largely moved away from anything that could be called a patriarchy and is instead plagued by gender roles that affect everyone in different ways and everyone tethered to the old ways are complicit.

There's things that hurt women, like the overwhelming sexual exploitation in the work place that can go unreported for years that lead to the metoo movement or reproductive rights which should have been a matter settled years ago yet we're still having to fight for it.

Meanwhile men deal with being treated like the aggressor in domestic disputes thanks to the Duluth model, Feeling as if they can't report rape or being disbelieved when it happens and the acceptance of genital mutilation as long as it happens to boys.",0,0,2018-08-18T09:02:52.000Z

"I was struck by how many of the comments made about incels in this video could, mutatis mutandis,  apply equally well to the way popular feminism is understood, embraced and practised by a significant number of younger women, especially c. 15 -24 year olds. 

For example, when discussing 'the black pill' you [ContraPoints] point out the  ultimate conclusion is that 'Happiness is impossible and there's nothing you can do except lie down and rot' [13:03]. Popular activism aside - the women's march and so on - the relentless bleakness of this vision of the world, I would say, is just as evident in the concepts of hegemonic and toxic masculinity; of rape culture; of the glass ceiling and so on.

In other words, there is a relentless hammering home of the message that if you are a woman you are a second class citizen; that you less respected; that you paid less; that you are worth less (and perhaps worthless); that your best efforts will inevitably be overlooked no matter how hard you try; that you have to work twice as hard to get half as far ... and so on.

What is all that if not a persistently and aggressively self-destructive message? What is all that if not a determined effort to make women feel hopeless in the face of 'Patriarchy'?

And much in the same way that you/C.P. shows how incels heap scornful mockery on the suggestion that they should just go to parties and socialise more or read books and etc., the rage and indignation that typically bounds back on anyone who tries to suggest that, you know, perhaps women in the western world (and certainly the women most often complaining loudest about it) might not actually have it quite so relentlessly awful as they have painted out after all is really quite something to behold.

Much like the incels described here, many young women who identify as feminists (online at least) seem to relish the idea of being oppressed and to take a distinctly dark delight in the idea that they are doomed and live in a culture that is designed to keep them subordinated.

Given the second wave inheritance modern feminism has and how second wave ideas still heavily influence contemporary feminism, it's maybe worth also noting the biographies of some of those leading figures of 1960s and 1970s feminism.

For instance, a number of key figures - Betty Friedan, Kate Millett, Shulamith Firestone - struggled with mental health at some point in their lives and, in the case of the latter two, had a serious impact on them. Andrea Dworkin's experiences with men in general were - I think it's fair to say - very far from typical and yet many of those experiences went on to inform her writings and her ideas about how all men relate to all women. 

Anyway ...",0,8,2018-08-18T07:44:22.000Z

"I really needed this video and loved it so much that I had to switch accounts because I'm too embarrassed to comment from my main one. 

For simplicities and personal sake I'm going to keep my life experiences short. I wasn't an Incel, MGTOW, PUA, or any of the sorts but I was in a path of becoming an Incel. I ""took"" the RedPill almost 6 years ago when I discovered and lurked the RedPill subreddit, ironically my issue was never with dating women but my self image and self esteem. I discovered the term Incels from the RedPill subreddit and soon found myself lurking around /r9k/ and multiple Incel forums out of pure curiosity because their mindset and ideology were very gripping and I felt comfort in throwing pity parties with other people who shares the similar mindsets, luckily I never went as far to ""taking"" the BlackPill. What a lot people especially those who aren't familiar to the overall culture don't understand is how seductive it is to those especially who are in their early 20s and in a really bad mental place and sees a tiny glimmer of hope of living a normal happy life. Watching this video 3 times actually inspired me not to only block those websites but to actually reach out to friends, family, and professional help.

What I really loved about this video is the amount of care and research you put into it didn't resort to mocking nor sympathy. I remember reading articles covering the Toronto attack a while back and was disappointed in most of the journalist who covered the Incel culture and don't get me started on the horrible takes most YouTubers had on Incel culture. The issues I had on the takes on it was that the culture was dismissed and oversimplified into ""they're extremely misogynistic social inept men"" which is 100% true, but no one dared to dive deeper to see how the toxic and harmful yet mesmerizing the Black Pill ideology to themselves to the point a lot of these people on those websites are conditioned to think that they cannot mentally escape it and resorts to suicide or revenge. Again, I really admire and respect your research and take on Incels. It was the push I needed to get away from it instead of moping around and reading depressing stories and posts to justify my pity party you are truly one of the good ones.

"Red Pill school of thought is based entirely on the objective observance of human behavior, as well as science from FEMALE scientists such as this one:  https://youtu.be/-LZZJTR0GxE

It can no longer be refuted that the grand majority of women prefer masculine men.  It is literally, according to science, due to the amount of testosterone a male has, as well as other genetic markers.  Keep in mind, we are talking about sexual attraction, and not relationships.  There are many people who would have sex with a person that they wouldn't want to have a relationship with.  However, when they repeatedly pass up others who are relationship material for people who aren't due to lust only, it tends to take a toll on the people who want a real relationship.  That particular experience isn't just exclusive to males.. and  plenty of females resent and complain about men that do that..  now it is just women doing the same.

"I was going to dislike this video, but the second half was good, here are some points though:

'blame the sin not the sinner' these are bad actions, however it is important to not make a strawman out of a negative lifestyle, bring these sad souls back to the fray.

there is nothing inherently wrong with:
incels 
pick up artists (though there's a fine line, 'real social dynamics'  RSD however seems to be great for self improvement)
MRAs 
MIGTOW
just as there is nothing inherently wrong with 'equality of the sexes' in the form of feminism, lots of people deflect blame or responsibility in negative ways, tradesmen do this, bitchy women do this, immigrants do this, people need to create better divides . between self-responsibility and negative social effects. 

""[women are] not loveable [to wannabe chads]"" to some maybe, however a lot of ""red pill"" males see many women as having to high a standard of themselves, which is true in many cases, and that self value should not be naively presumed. 

""[Jordan Peterson] is a sexist old man"" that is a far stretch, however if anyone has some evidence to the contrary tell me.

"The thing about Chad-splaining really stuck out to me, because I've articulated something similar to that before. I had a friend (a girl) who was absolutely convinced that she would never have a romantic relationship. Any advice or consolation I gave her was utterly useless, I realized, because to her, it must have looked like a millionaire telling a poor person that the key to success is ""working hard."" Sure, some things might be universally applicable, but the deck is clearly stacked from the start. And at the time, I was dating two people, and she was single. What could I possibly tell her that wouldn't look like I was rubbing her face in my romantic success?

I say ""had"" a friend, by the way, because she killed herself. The lack of romantic relationships wasn't the sole cause, I think (she was in a pretty depressing social and financial situation), but it was definitely a factor. The black pill spiral thing (catastrophizing and denying all reasonable attempts at injecting logic) is absolutely something I recognize because she had it pretty badly.",0,0,2018-08-18T04:53:41.000Z

"Speaking as someone who (years ago) could have very easily become an incel, I feel pretty bad for them. I don't agree at all with their whole red pill/black pill theorizing, but I can sympathize with the depressed, lonely side of it. I think a big help for me was things like a little bit of college, getting a job, and managing to have friends who cared enough about me to pull me out of the depression slump I was in.

I mean, I still think a lot of people are totally self-loathing. Nobody likes who they are. Everybody has these dumb, nonsensical irrational insecurities. Which I find so...beautifully ironic. I don't know if you were joking about your whole bone structure thing, TBH I think you look just fine. But to you, whatever you don't like is a HUGE PROBLEM. Just like what you said about the incel selfies---these are all pretty average looking dudes. Some of them may even look decently attractive if they put in the effort to clean themselves up and work on being more photogenic. To them, though, they think they're below garbage. They think their entire life is hopeless, and all based on what? These irrational thoughts of self-loathing.

But I think you know as well as I do that there's a difference between overzealous self-loathing and hating how your hair isn't cooperating with you today. For incels, it's all very overzealous.

Anyway, what saved me from my mental retardation was the very thing I had spent all my life hiding from --- being social. Ironically, socializing and making friends and going out is what made me reach the realization that EVERYBODY has stupid insecurities. What one person stresses over is something that I would think was nothing to get worked up about. It made me also realize that there are tons of dudes way uglier than I am with pretty attractive women. It made me realize what all of these people meant by ""be yourself"".

I just want to find an incel and try to help them discover themselves. I honestly don't think it's possible to crawl out of that void on your own. You need a helping hand. It all starts with you, for sure. You have to be willing to grab whatever hand reaches out to you. But that's honestly a very easy thing to do. It's not that hard to accept. I know from experience.

It never even crosses any of these nerds minds that there are many women who are just as unattractive, unpopular and starved of self  assurance as they are.  Given many incels admit to having shit personalities too (mainly as a troll-shielding mechanism), I know its not a matter of ""muh' inner beauty""

If you're someone who not only refuses to give women in your own league the time of day because you feel entitled to ""something better"" but also conflates your own self worth and ideas towards women so heavily with ""getting laid/losing that V card"" go fuck yourself.

"Contra, it is amazing how you keep your videos' quality so high and consistent, you are a goddess among YouTubers. While I really did not want to empathize with incel men, I admit you did tug at my heartstrings with your bit on digital self-harm.

The only thing I felt was missing from this video was a bit on women who are incels. There have been NUMEROUS attempts at creating a women's only space for women who can't find dates and feel ugly, but they always ended up deleted because incels would write horrible messages about how every woman there was a narcissist, all her problems were her own fault, and imagining grotesque scenarios about the various ways these women could lose their virginity.

I've even read a few articles on the topic (although they're hard to find since articles for incels are about twenty times more common), and the comments always included guys posting the same comments about how all single women are either grotesque or too demanding.

While incel communities are toxic, they are at least a community. Women don't even have that. It's kind of terrible how the assumption that women are just selecting the best Chad cocks atop their golden throne can seriously damage the self-esteem of women and especially teenage girls.

"It seems like the comment section is filled with people attributing their own mental disorders to what could be causing the distortions that incels come up with, so I guess I'll add my own. I wonder how many incels have a fear of intimacy, and found that self-harm and deflecting on feminism was the path of least resistance. They want to characterize themselves as ""repulsive"" in a passive way such as by their looks or social skill, but are actually *very* active in repelling people away from them, perhaps reflexively (""involuntarily""?).

Like, in the abstract, I'm lonely for someone who I can share my life with, but when it comes to the nuts and bolts of actually forming and maintaining an intimate relationship, it's fear, uncertainty and doubt all the way down. About insufficiency, about causing arguments that didn't need to happen, about a perpetual guilt that you aren't doing enough or even the bare minimum, and then expressing your deficiency through extraordinary defensiveness with your girlfriend. Or maybe she IS being unreasonable, but you absorb it as your fault anyway, forming an unhealthy codependent situation. And knowing that's exactly what you're doing, but being too afraid to say so because you're a coward, and unable or unwilling to do anything about it even if you could somehow convey it.

I guess I'm saying that my one or two attempts at relationships (which for the record did not get beyond 2nd base because I was too afraid to go any further) didn't work out that well and reinforced my fear. I could easily see that turning into blaming the entire world for my fear, or just indulging wholeheartedly in hopelessness, if I wasn't already painfully aware that that's bullshit. But I'm also unwilling/unable to face my fear and seek appropriate help, if help even exists. I went to a therapist, which helped in other areas, but was too afraid to even bring it up.",0,2,2018-08-18T04:29:28.000Z

"So basically, incels thrive off the old stereotype that all women care about are looks and how much a man can give them when they go shopping. There are certainly people who place materialism and shallowness above all else, but it's grossly ignorant to believe it's gender exclusive. I know more men guilty of this shit than women, and the biggest turnoff for most is a self-absorbed narcissist. It's like these fucks watched an episode of the Kardashians and based their world view on it.",1,0,2018-08-18T03:59:05.000Z

"I grew up with Autism. I had a shit social life for a long time, virtually no love life until 18, and still deal with the repercussions of that (depression, self harm, anxiety).

All I had to do was ask about their interests and discuss my own and it worked! My doughy autistic white ass got laid!

"The last part is something I can almost understand, despite it being so extreme. The issue is that it's irrational, they hate the feeling of inferiority, but they think that enforced inferiority is coming from women. The truth is is we live in a really unhealthy society when it comes to things like sex and women. Sexualized advertisements of women are EVERYWHERE, they are in every movie and every tv show. Then there's the unlimited access to pornography. If you can't see the problem is the representation of women, the idea that getting attractive women equals self worth and status is fucked up - then you will hate and blame women rather than the culture and society that made this so. You can't escape it, and I do think it can breed these feelings of hate and rage combined with other mindsets. 


I just think it's very similar to working class rage that can manifest itself into hatred of minorities or turning to white nationalism. They are targeting their feelings of discontent in completely wrong and harmful ways.",24,8,2018-08-18T03:48:37.000Z

"What's really great about this too is seeing just how tied political ideologies are to sexuality. 

I know for myself personally the difference between verging on becoming an alt-right mfer was that they would always tell me how feminists hate me, that i'm not going to be compatible with any woman because of my masculinity and that I'm doomed to be alone and angry. I just kept feeding that to myself with the videos I had watched.

It's all channeled into feminism since we all want someone to blame, but every time I would see a feminist at that time all I could think about was how society is casting me away, and that I'm not compatible with women, that I would never have a relationship, or happiness etc. 

One problem is I think that masculinity isn't really given to men after puberty, its earned through being good with women, and when you believe there's this over arching conspiracy to isolate your dick from society, then you start to believe your worthless, but only because you are being suppressed.

Idk, I think this is such a huge underlying motivator for a lot of men to join in these ways of thinking, i'm just glad I was able to find channels like these for real.",0,0,2018-08-18T03:28:24.000Z

I'm pretty much the prototypical incel, or maybe the lower end of normie anyway. I check most of the boxes. 5'6"", feminine skull, baby wrists and scrawny. Not the most masculine voice either. The only thing I have going for me in their book is a little bit of forward facial growth and blue eyes. Yet, I've had (to my own surprise) more than one girl in the past 6 months take the initiative and express interest in me, one of them being what these guys would call at least a 9 if not a 10 (I was ""her type""). Not to brag. I have obsessed about my features and to be honest, the incels are half right. But from the past few months I've realized if you wanna be what they call a ""hopecel"", just imitate the exact opposite of every personality trait that these guys assume, and you'll be fine.

Also, you're right about TTTT. It's a brain-rotting cesspool. And I've never heard of digital self-harm, but that's a really interesting and relevant concept that I'm glad you brought up.

I'm kind of shocked; they're responding to this video, and not in the way I expected.  Or, I mean, a LOT of people are responding in exactly the way I expected.  But I've seen quite a few comments really taking the term ""digital self-harm"" seriously and questioning the value of the group.  There's obviously so much toxicity and abuse there, but I really think in some small way you might have reached some of the folks on that forum already, and made them question if visiting places like that is really good for them. I know that wasn't altogether the intention of this video, and was kind of a tangent to relate that experience to that of incels, but I still thought you should know that on some microcosm at least a few people in one of the most dark and toxic corners of the web seem to be being reached.",0,1,2018-08-18T02:39:56.000Z

Point is you make me think in ways I probably wouldn't have otherwise, even though I think we have inherently similar viewpoints on the world - you have a perspective that I can never fully imagine, but you put it into words that give me the chance to empathize on a level I don't know if I really could otherwise.

"I think many incel or other self-abuse types seek out a sympathetic cohort because there are two possibilities and one is more frustrating than the other. One possibility is I am doomed and it is outside my control. Now that is miserable but there is relief in knowing it‚Äôs not my own fault. The other option is there is a path to happiness but despite my pondering it nearly constantly I can‚Äôt figure out how to get there. Now my suffering is entirely my own fault, I suffer because I am failing. That position allows for hope but is I think much more painful than the doom scenario. 

An asteroid is coming which will end the world, that is terrible but one can arrive at a piece knowing there is nothing you can do, so you see your friends and family tell everyone you love them and get ready for the end. However the world is ending because we are failing to do the right things and make the right choices. That is insufferable. Because we know we could fix it and it is our own broken failure that is going to end the world. This is why incels seek abuse from each other I think. Because the idea that one‚Äôs own misery is self inflicted or a failure to rise as most others have is‚Ä¶.well that‚Äôs just an awful feeling.",30,2,2018-08-18T02:28:29.000Z

"I don't think bone structure goes into it as much as incels think it does. It's more about social intelligence. Many incels probably have high IQs (or think that they do) so they'd never imagine that their intelligence is the reason they cant get laid but its true.

Sure, some of them can work at it and get better but most are destined to be naturally awkward and weird for the rest of their lives. They can't do anything about it.

In the end, having a bad personality is just as ""tragic"" as having a bad face in terms of not being able to change it and having it prevent you from getting laid.... But either way.... Who cares?

I know boards like /b/ love baiting incels into feeling ashamed of their virginity or the size of their penis. I've seen it happen a lot but we need to stay strong and realize sex isn't everything. It's ok to never get laid. 

You will probably never get laid. But you will probably never fly a helicopter either and that doesn't consume you does it?

TL;dr:
Treat sex as if it was flying a helicopter. Sure it would be cool to do but you don't need to do it to be happy",12,17,2018-08-18T02:21:40.000Z

A friend of mine sent me your video on Degeneracy a few days ago, and it was the first time I had ever seen your content. I was thrown off for a second when you started speaking, because I hadn't known you were trans. That's how feminine you look; if your voice had been more feminine or you hadn't mentioned your ""blocking your T and popping your E"" in the video, I would never have known. And just comparing that video to this one, even your voice is sounding more feminine all the time. I honestly don't think you need any surgery on your face.

"You where right about the trigger warnings. I thought I could handle it. I really, really did. I really like you and your channel. But the way they hate women and all the stuff that they said about us - it cut to the core. Part of me was convinced that there are no good men left because the ones that can get laid or relationships- treat us like objects and disrespect us and the ones that can't resent us and objectify us even more. And then you mentioned the catastrophizing behavior and that is so like me and the stuff I was thinking about men. I hate how true ""Men are afraid that women will laugh at them. Women are afraid that men will kill them,"" still is. It makes it hard to trust people because they could be going home and looking at this horrible shit on their computers, perpetuating this poison and making killers. I know incels act like women can't be ""involuntary celibate""- but they can- I haven't been in a relationship in years and I feel invisible especially on dating apps. And the part about digital self-harm for me is true too.

"Honestly, a lot of that generic incels advice is beyond useless. Stuff like ""you just need to get out more"" or ""just be more confident"" are so vague and simplistic that they'll never help anyone. The incel is not at home on Reddit every night because they keep turning down offers from their many regular friends to go to social functions, the incel is home on Reddit because they have nowhere else to be. They don't know how to ""get out"" more or meet new people. 

And confidence is not really something many people are great at faking. It's a difficult skill to learn. Most people gain confidence from their success and abilities, not the other way around. Building confidence takes time. 

If anyone ever wants to actually help these guys, try convincing them to do things that are specific and achievable without the help of other people.

And also dating apps for men are unreliable at best. Unlike most women, most men do not know how to make themselves look good in pictures. Unlike most women, most men will not check back on their Tinder every 4 hours to find dozens more women who want to fuck them. Some will, of course, but like the video points out, there's a pretty enormous gap between the two sexes for experience with online dating.",0,0,2018-08-18T01:54:27.000Z

"Honestly I must admit I feel very identified to the list at 9:00 bot ONLY up to point 5.
It is a very lonely and unpleasant feeling though, and I can see how people can get kinda strange about it.
It is genuinely painful to feel like that. I think it comes from suffering from social anxiety, depression and perhaps other mental illnesses, but it doesn't feel good.
I don't empathize with ""incels"" because they blame women for their woes, but I do find myself somewhat represented. It's so easy to fall into the trap  of blaming yourself for things you have no control over and it's really painful. People tell you to accept what you can't change, but no one tells you how. Do you just live with it until you've accepted it? Because it can survive as a destructive parasite in your mind for years without your ever ""accenting"" it, or even getting used to the feeling of inadequacy.
I sometimes feel hurt when people mock incels, because the way it feels to not be able to form a romantically intimate relationship when you desperately want one is just not nice. I don't care about sex that much, even. In fact it's more about the sort of intense attention that you receive from someone who wants you and likes you.",0,0,2018-08-18T01:17:28.000Z

And some people use that as permission to give up on changing for the better. It's a fear of failure, they're afraid of trying their hardest and still not getting what they want.",70,2,2018-08-18T01:16:34.000Z

"I often think about how I repressed my bisexuality until fairly recently and what finally prompted me to ""give up"" my supposed heterosexuality. Growing up, I was only interested in girls and I actually hated boys. I was also fairly gender non-conforming and feminine, so the boys thought that I was a ""faggot"" and the girls thought that I was just a weirdo. During middle school, I received so much homophobic bullying and harassment just because people ""thought"" that I was gay that I rejected anything queer. I had to be straight to prove the asshole boys who bullied me wrong. I had to get a girlfriend to prove to them and even myself that I was straight.

So in high school, I obsessed with getting a girlfriend by any means necessary. I tortured myself and kind of became a creeper (in the asexual sense; I've never been interested in sex, but I've always been a hopeless romantic). The problem was, I have never been good at being the masculine, stoic, gruff kind of guy. I have always been extremely feminine in my mannerisms, interests, and personality. So girls were almost never attracted to guys like me. So in that sense, I do empathize with ""incels"" and the nerdy misanthropes who resent women, because I've been there.

It was only a year ago that I realized that I was bisexual after uncovering some repressed memories of crushing on boys in middle school. Part of me wonders if I only accepted my bisexuality or even if I'm just pretending to be bi because I've resigned myself to the fact that women will never be attracted to me in the same way I'm attracted to them. Like, ""Well, if I can't get a girlfriend, I might as well be gay as a last resort.""

But now that I've accepted my queerness, I find myself not as attracted to women as I used to be. It may have something to do with also questioning my gender and wondering if my obsession with girls growing up was rooted in secretly wanting to be one. I dunno, I have a lot of issues and I'm still exploring that aspect of myself. But it's astonishing how ingrained I was in that toxic masculine worldview, even though I've never been masculine.",0,0,2018-08-18T00:47:41.000Z

I do absolutely think that, using the MRA as example, that their communication and moderation leaves a lot to be desired.... much like it does for certain feminist groups. Likewise, I think that the worst 'actors' get way too much recognition, and are being assigned too much credit as speaking for the whole group. Just like most feminists are very reasonable people concerned about inequality, I bet that most MRA's are merely concerned about inequality from the opposite side.... where on both sides the extreme voices are the ones that are cited as evidence for the mentality for the whole group.

Please don't make a Nazi comparison.... we could do that for any group, particularly if there are some extremists in there, and the only thing is accomplishes is shutting down a conversation or discussion.",0,1,2018-08-18T00:42:53.000Z

I have read into subject quite a bit because I have no life, I guess.

Look at his skull shape, his looks, his height, etc.  That guy could date anyone he wants.  It's because he has a passion people can gather around and he sees women as human beings.  

I think if someone can't seem to unfuck themselves from this toxic perspective-- there must be some kind of leanings toward serious mental unrest.  For one thing, a lot of these people feel seething rage seeing other people happy.  I'm not sure any online forum could coax me into feeling that level of hatred for anyone regardless of my circumstance.

"Hey Contra,
I love all your videos.
The only thing i incorporated from their ideology is that marriage is a scam. I raise my son alone. When we were watching and caring for our son, my ex, the mother of my child, betrayed me with at least 5 other man. At that point i realized if a child doesn't give the mother a reason, as well as a caring and loving boyfriend/father, to not betray me and stay faithful, a ring won't help at all. 

I hated woman for 2 years, YouTube knew that, fed on my hatred, and influenced me with womanhating (MGTOW) channels. According to JBP and general personality psychology (Big Five Traits), i am pretty much a woman. Who cares, 
i watched right-wing channels, only to realize their hipocracy.


Everyone has some points, even them.
I just hope that everyone can find some love. My son get's a lot of love from me. MGTOW people tell everyone, If you see a parent that raises their child alone, to stay away from them.
Relationships are complicated, they just don't have the strength to endure pain. I now know what i could've done better. She knows it too.

Left-Right, Woman-Man let's not fight, let's talk. 
We want the best for our surroundings. We just somehow lost the way.

It worked. And it was you üòÇ

"You are right in general, but it is pretty undeniable that certain physical characteristics are considered more attractive ON AVERAGE by humans in a society at any given time and also even across different cultures and time periods. For example, being tall really does give men an advantage in the sexual marketplace. Also having a symmetrical face gives humans in general an advantage. And obviously if your face has been completely burned off in a fire, for instance, it WILL of course be much much harder for you to find sexual intimacy. I also think that we are hardwired to become very frustrated or even depressed when we can't find sexual intimacy for very long periods of time, especially when we're relatively young. So I'm not sure how much you can really blame these guys for feeling the way that they do. Self improvement always is possible in my opinion, but it's much more of a struggle for some than for others. And I also don't think Jordan Peterson ""traditional masculinity"" type stuff can simply be ignored here. Women on average do prefer so called ""chads"". So if you're one of these incel guys then probably the best solution for you is to just join the marines. Of course if you're physically and emotionally fragile boot camp will be absolutely terrible for you, but if you get through it you'll probably be somewhat fuckable at the end.

The problem with this is that everything gets worse and not better. I may even procrastinate a lot just by thinking everything I'll do will never be good enough.

I don't know where this comes from, but I think people are afraid of getting disappointed with themselves. It must be something like ""If I always put myself down, I'll be less hurt when someone criticize me"". One way or another, it's just an completely messed up and illogical escape route.

"I remember when I was an incel. luckily a few years passed, I showered, grew up a little, stopped worrying about sex, and actually could've landed myself an attractive girlfriend (But I knew I wasn't ready to date so I didn't pursue). The best advice I could give to anyone right now is to not look outward (i.e sex, money, fame, looks ect) but simply look inwards (is it your personality, how outgoing are you, how often do you go out and talk to strangers) and figure out a way to connect with people. It is possible, you just need to stay positive and stop thinking about sex 24/7!",7,0,2018-08-17T23:53:46.000Z
"It's not just that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable (lots of parts of the body are): it's that it's both that, and the substructure of the *face* - the *expressive organ* of the body, the extremely flexible, extremely (and even deliberately) individuated part of us most tied to feeling, performative signalling, communication of the inward and personal self, etc.

The skull signifies that underlying everything you think makes you *you*, an expressive and responsive individual in a dynamic, shifting social field, is hard, impersonal, dead, immutable natural law.

"Some more advice concerning Incel: as said, just quit the forums and get the sexual frustration fixed. Rather than a psychotherapist visit some friendly prostitutes in a clean brothel, which will suck all the frustration out. Better than a surgeon can remove a tumour. After having fornicated enough, come to the conclusion, that sex is fun, but ultimately pointless. Transmitting your genes is what nature wants us animals to do, but is ultimately pointless - furthermore, there are already too many homo sapiens on planet Earth. 

Then read Emil Cioran, which is ""worse"" than any black pill you'll ever encounter. So you get really depressed. Then read some Albert Camus and come to the conclusion that the world is absurd, but life still worth living. Congratulations! You just got a lot healthier. Now move on. Consider yourself a greater man than before, if it helps you. Watch some Monty Python and have a good fap. Try a homosexual experience, if you're curious, even if you end up not liking it you lost nothing. 

Years later have a good laugh about the Incel mindset. You should be immune to this stuff now, so maybe you can help others trapped in this downward spiral of self-hate, hate and dullness. You've emerged out of a dead end... now able to fully enjoy the grand circus of life...",0,0,2018-08-17T23:52:04.000Z

"Same here.  Before my transition into womanhood, I was more interested in girls than I was guys (mostly due to having been raised in a phobic household).  However, being a socially awkward, obese guy, with feminine tendencies, most women didn't find me attractive.  The ones who did find me attractive, I wasn't paying attention to them at the time.  Because I wasn't looking for my equal.  I didn't want to be with a girl who mirrored my flaws, to remind me of my inadequacies.  I wanted a girlfriend with conventional beauty, and social acceptance, so that I could feel beautiful, and socially accepted, whether I was in reality or not.  I wanted to escape, and forget how ugly I felt I was by having a gorgeous girlfriend.  Back in middle school, and high school I used to bawl over getting rejected by girls.  But that was my fault for A. wanting a relationship for all the wrong reasons, and B. trying to date the wrong girls.  

A year after high school, at the age of 19, I decided that I didn't need a trophy girlfriend in order to boost myself esteem.  I had this new found love for myself.  I wanted to find my equal, and have a girlfriend who was just as much of a dork as I was, and love her like I love myself.  My life changed with this mindset.  I ended up marrying my first girlfriend, and we were together for 10 years of ups & downs, till I came out as a trans woman, and then we had a no-fault divorce.  (Side note: Nowadays, I'm attracted to the type of man who reminds me of the person I used to be when I was a guy.  Is that weird, or do other trans women do this as well?)      

So I understand incels, and feel kinda sorry for them.  But I also know that they bring a lot of their emotional pain upon themselves, and they're definitely not coping the right way.",78,6,2018-08-17T23:50:24.000Z

Men are taught women are sex objects to be owned and not human beings with the option to say ""NO!"", that's why Incels hate feminism.

"Taking a bunch of in-house jokes that do have some bit of truth to them literally and trying to expose its dumbness on the surface with fancy music and words  can hardly be called a ""contrapoint"", and coupled with the recurring pervert ""jokes"", it's rather annoying..

The viewpoint explanations after that were a bit on the extreme side, but it still gives an overall view of some of the twisted minds that some of the members have. The 20/80 ""rule"" is true when it comes to looks though, even though personality comes a long way when it comes to getting laid, so that does balance it out somewhat.

I know that belittling Jordan Peterson by calling him an old man, a sexist (why'd you think that in the first place) man is a circle jerk of certain leftists, but it's frankly ignorant and snobbish. (Not that I agree with those who literally deify him)

And I beg you, please don't do the genitalia surgery as it's basically like opening up a festering volcano of pus, a wound bound to get infected. It's a procedure that cannot produce a normal looking, clean ""vagina"".

Most of the comments on the post not only agreed with it but also said that they were glad they saw the 'truth', because living in a harsh reality was better than living in happy fantasy.

If they were told that, actually, they look normal or even attractive, that must mean that there's a different reason for their singleness other than their appearance. Like, say, their character. And character, unlike height or skull shape, can be changed. But genuine self-reflection is difficult and scary. So, by telling each other that they are hopelessly ugly, incels are reassuring each other that they don't have to change. And that's, in a way, comforting.

"So in order for this to be a largely male problem, women (being the placeholder for heterosexual women hereafter) must get laid or enter into relationships at higher rates than men. That means many men are having relations with more than one woman at a time.

Or there are just as many lonely women as men, but they don‚Äôt date incels because they aren‚Äôt what they‚Äôre looking for, and they don‚Äôt want to share a man of sufficient status.

Unlike the incels, they don‚Äôt just want someone to love them, regardless of any other traits they might have. They have standards, and they‚Äôre perfectly fine being chaste until someone meets those standards. 

Even if they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúperfectly fine‚Äù and they get depressed from being unloved, maybe we just don‚Äôt hear about it, because, on average, women are lower in aggression. You‚Äôre far more likely to get a criminally aggressive lonely man than a criminally aggressive lonely woman, biologically speaking.

Maybe it‚Äôs like mismatched buttons on a shirt. You‚Äôre assigning lower buttons (mid-status women) to higher button-holes (high status men) this leaves buttons on the top with no holes (high status women) and holes on the bottom with no buttons (low status men).

I‚Äôm pretty sure there is a problem with high status women not finding any suitable men because they‚Äôd prefer to mate with someone who is higher than them, and the men at their level would rather date lower-status women because they‚Äôre intimidated by a high status lover.

It‚Äôs possible there‚Äôs some incels who simply can‚Äôt get laid because they are so mentally ill that socializing is literally impossible even though they‚Äôve been trying wholeheartedly for years to become more sociable, fit, and wealthy.

"Damn, at 30:42 is a bit eerie, if you just get rid of 6, 7 and 8, this could've been written by me at any point over the last 7 months. 

I mean, the ""in"" in ""incel"" means involuntary, and so that technically isn't me since I know a couple girls I *could* call and invite over, but a one-night-stand isn't going to cut it. It would probably feel good for one night, but then everything would be worse than it was to begin with, and I would be obsessing over the fact that it's not that night anymore, and I am alone once again.

I *don't* think I'll be good enough for anyone who will actually want to be in it for the long-haul (although I was good enough to keep the same girl for 10 years, but now I'm just a shell of my former shell of my former shell). 

I don't think that ""women"" did it to me, they had even less control over my decline than I did, and I sure as hell don't blame feminism (if I didn't go through the stupid macho conditioning and do time, I don't think I'd be like this, and feminism would have prevented that if it could have). 

I think I actually blame circumstances that were under no one's control, as well as my own mental health, which is a self-perpetuating cycle, getting sadder and less hopeful because of this loneliness and feeling like I don't matter, like there isn't anyone on the planet who needs me or gets anything from me that they couldn't get anywhere else. 

Then the generalized ""humanity itself is doomed"" part, I tend to think that is true for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the social and political tides sweeping the entire world, and especially in the US. As for the only option being to ""lie down and rot,"" well I'm not sure if I think that is the ONLY option, but it's the one I've been leaning toward. 

All that said, separation makes the heart grow fonder, and I can't imagine hating women and thinking they're evil because *I am not good enough.* Life itself? Of course I fucking hate life itself. Mine in particular. I don't hate women though, and it isn't the fault of women that I am in utter misery. It's not primarily my fault either, like I said, a lot of it was shit that just happened. I became all fucked up in a very short time, and I guess no one wants to be there for all that. I haven't done the best job fighting it and keeping myself healthy, and I am a net drain on anyone who gets close to me because of it. I don't think I could help it either though. My whole family is dead, all my friends are dead, my sister killed herself and my drummer overdosed and my best friend was murdered. Cancer and car accidents. Heroin and suicide. Heart attacks. Murder. None of that shit had anything to do with feminism, none of it was caused by women. We just live in a cold, indifferent world, existence is made up of primarily pain, and some of us will end up in more pain than we can withstand.",21,4,2018-08-17T22:52:57.000Z
"This video sort of revealed unto me how I was very close to bordering these black pill levels of Incel ideology minus all the skull nonsense some time ago.

My coping mechanism for finding myself unattractive and someone women wouldn't want to seek was based on rejections and their distaste in everything I did, I often found myself blaming myself for it without mercy and spiraling myself into the depths of all that is bad about Incels really.

However I did find solace early on from the fact I... Eventually turned into men for comfort in such cases. Not just the ""manly man who will treat me well"" but overall any other guy who happened to like me back, either as a friend or even beyond that. Over the past few years I have eventually regained some of my confidence and also slowly growing back that attraction to women I shunned out completely because of prior mentioned reasoning, but I no longer blame it on something like being bad looking and undesirable, but rather just the fact I wasn't thinking it from the right mindset. I wasn't seeking those who I hit it off with, I was purely after those who I found attractive from looks back at the time. I'm glad I got so much comfort from so many people during that time I was at my worst and who held me back from committing bad things to myself because of self-loathing and eventually helped me recover myself as a person. If anything it also did help me realize more about my sexuality and that it wasn't just a coping mechanism for me, and it felt natural anyways, I just hadn't given it a try before circumstances ""forced"" me into it. I still like men, women, and all of those who don't define themselves by the binary system. I wasn't undesirable back in the day because I looked bad, it was because of a spiralling downward loop of bad choices I made because of one rejection. I stopped caring about my looks completely because I thought it didn't matter. I tried to balance it off by acting in a way that would be more desirable, but it wasn't a match to my personality. And all of this led me to just desperation and suicidal thoughts. That me is gone now though and while I knew this even beforehand, it is this very video right here that definitively gave me some of the answers I was looking for and couldn't word out myself.

Thank you Natalie for all you do, you bring solace to people like me who have a hard time trying to explain these subjects that seem hard to grasp to myself and I've been able to show some friends your content that has shaped them into being more understanding of subjects they previously only really treated as jokes, big one being transexuality to state the obvious.

"I used to be on a discord server full of ironic alt-right memers who all hated me. They got to know me in the beginning of my self-discovery when I turned from a kid into a person with problems and flaws, and also they just didn't like my leftism. I stopped really posting on this server after a short while, but for a good year I would regularly search my own name and all my aliases on this server to read any disparaging comments made about me. Every few weeks there'd be a new comment about ""what happened to that f*ggot?"" and I'd always make sure I read it whilst rereading all the old ones. I' have since left the server and (mostly) stopped this behaviour, but I think back to it and it's just... addictive. There's an addictive lure to reading the awful stuff people think and say about you, especially when you already don't feel great about yourself, that just can't be explained. The comparison to self harm is incredibly pertinent because it really is just like that, at least for me, the lure feels exactly the same and I can feel it's addictive pull. Although I've been lucky enough to avoid falling into the trap of self harm, I know from my urges to it just how similar it feels to the desire to read about how awful you are. It's honestly scary.

Sorry this is a bit of a ramble, but this video really made me reflect on these past experiences and what I used to do and still want to do sometimes scares me when I truly stop to think about it.",3,2,2018-08-17T22:44:32.000Z

"You don‚Äôt have to sympathize with them, my Queen, but I will. I know what it was like to feel the way they did through my teen years, and I didn‚Äôt even lose my virginity till I was 19, only a couple months before 20 (both my hetero and my homo virginity I lost within 2 months). I can imagine how going on for another 3, 4, 5, 10, et al, years beyond what I did, never having experienced sex, intimacy, romance, and love, that the isolation and loneliness would become unbearably dark. Knowing what it was like to feel even a bit of that pain, and even just the fact that I love humans, makes it hard for me not to feel bad for these unbelievably delusional, hopeless, lonely people..

That said, at no point in my pain did I, or could I have imagined, becoming such a toxic bigot. That‚Äôs the part of this that makes me have contempt for incels, while simultaneously feeling bad for them. The bigotry doesn‚Äôt blow my mind, that‚Äôs just run of the mill misogynistic delusion, and plenty of guys with such sexist views get laid all the time. What does blow my mind, big time, is all the jargon and how pseudoscientific their beliefs are. You have access to a computer, you‚Äôre literally on it, please for the love of god, go read about the psychology and biology that you‚Äôre incorporating into your views, and realize how insane this deterministic shit is. 

Anyway, these are extremely depressed people, as in clinically ill, and I‚Äôm sure many of them have multiple mental health problems. That‚Äôs, in part, why Nat hits the nail on the head with saying they MUST get away from the environments (irl and online) that are reinforcing their delusions. They really aren‚Äôt going to have much of a chance of getting better, unless they get away from those spaces, and get help (preferably clinical, but whatever it takes). Anyway, I digress..

"Wow, Nat, idk if you'll get to read this but I just want to put it out there that, surprisingly, I related a lot to this, at least about half of it. I'm not a fucking incel, but I'm a trans guy who's been strugling with chest dysphoria, as per usual, and that thing about self hatred, feeling sorry for yourself and self loathing. For weeks I've been going on and on about how aweful I feel, and how top surgery feels like a long dream that'll never happen, instead of putting in the work to actually get to it. I mean, I still have a lot of reflecting to do on the matter, but this thought just hadn't ocurred to me and your video actually helped! You're amazing. Aside from the topics and your smart analysis of them, I love how honest you've let yourself be about your dysphoria.

"As I'm writing this, the self-reflection is causing me to realize and rethink a bunch of stuff, and thus come back and rewrite big chunks, so sorry if this comes out all disjointed, it was not written remotely linearly.

When I was 18, I learned the term ""involuntarily celibate"" and adopted it to describe myself. I'm remembering some things that I am legit ashamed of now, but at the very least, I can say I never fell in with one of these communities to reinforce my feelings of inadequacy. As such...I eventually got over it. Unrequited feelings suck, for sure, but at some point, rejection changed from a stab into a bump that might not even bruise. At first, I thought maybe I just aged out of it, turning 30, the raging hormones calming down, and having had enough experience to form reasonable expectations for relationships.

But now (like, right now), I'm realizing there were a few other things going on at the same time. First, that I started taking antidepressants, which was a huge kick-in-the-dick to my...well, to my dick, for one, so not only do a lot of things bother me less on the whole due to the meds, but sex in particular has a much smaller influence in my life. Second‚Äîwhat I would like to attribute a lot of it to, but I really can't say for sure‚Äîis starting to read and watch a lot of feminist stuff online. Like, I've always thought of myself as a feminist, but it had always been in this big, impersonal kind of way‚Äîit was how things should be done within organizations and society as a whole, not really how I specifically should think or feel. But I started learning this stuff, started recognizing my own shittiness, and the idea that someone's attraction to me is entirely separate from what they thought of me as a person made so much more sense, and let that stuff roll off my back a lot easier.

I'm, uh, not really sure anymore if I was making a point with this. I guess that there's some things I also begrudgingly sympathize with them on? Because there but for the grace of god go I. And maybe also that they aren't all beyond redemption.",2,1,2018-08-17T22:37:36.000Z

"Lot to unpack in that video. and lots i feel I need to admit ahead.

1) I literally clapped at 'Fin' and said out loud ""Bravo! Bravisimo! Bravo!"" because damn you're fucking killing it, Nat. And i'm a nerd, obvs.

2) This video reminds me much about how I have used the internet and integrated into its communities over the last 12 years. I could've ended up like any incel or channer that you describe or show here. And I still have thoughts or feelings that place me in an extremely arrogant and superior person, over women, over other LGBTQ+ people, over any those society has deemed lesser to me, the white cis guy I was taught to be. I've even realised I've gone through catastrophising in my own way.
For most of my life from puberty onward, I have felt unfuckable, unlovable. I'm a 26yr old virgin (in my mind anyway) and society has made out sex to be my ultimate goal and the fact I haven't, in my own way, fulfilled that has meant I am failing at life. Whether it comes from seeing couples, hearing friends get married, see my friends dating people I wanted to, seeing my parents ageing as they seem to want grandkids, in every corner of my life, I feel I am expected to be fucking no matter whether I want to or not, whether it's for my own good or not.
The only reason I got out of this rut (partially, because i'm sometimes still dragged into I guess being a spinster? fucking anxiety an depression for ya) was from friends I made, hobbies I started, careers I focused on. Doing more of what I love meant I felt fulfilled. Even small things like organising my room, meeting up with a friend, keeping a schedule going to the gym, it felt easier. Like Natalie says, playing a guitar focuses this urge in us, well any passion can do that. Doesn't mean you won't want to fuck, heck I masturbate a lot still, or that you're not 'good enough' to fuck, it just means sex doesn't have to be the be all end all of life. Plenty of people I know aren't married or in a relationship in their 50s, 60 or 70s, they've never been married, they've never had kids, life isn't some stereotype film which dictates our ending, and failure to do so is anyone's fault. We all need to feel fulfilled, but it's something we choose to pursue, and if we choose to harm others based on this, then we're doing a terrible fucking job.

3) Natalie is a goddess, and I hope you get the guy or girl you deserve that loves you and fucks you right.

4) There's something quite linked between incel and violent porn. I've seen a lot of manosphere type porn games especially over the years, from all the way back in newgrounds early days to some of the patreons now. It's disturbing.
There's a lot of manipulation, coercion, out right rape that comes off as something the women love to do, and it's where I learnt about the term Chad first, the Chad being the antagonist, whilst typically the nerdy type character is the protagonist who steals the girl away because they're smarter or learn to be stronger, beat the Chad up and eventually fuck the girl who is in awe of him. It's classic wish fulfilment and fantasy, but it reminds me how it shapes a person's worldview on things.
There are so many of these games with these tropes, where they can manipulate or coerce women into being malleable sex slaves that any difference to this creates and anger of source, and incels seem to aim that squarely at the women they often portray in the media they consume. 
Feminism hasn't made women seem hostile, patriarchy does.


I said earlier that I felt I needed to admit all this. Partly because Incels might read it and guys, like Natalie says, you're probably normal looking guys, and those forums and people that tell you otherwise are preying on that for their own self worth because they themselves feel shitty about their lives. But also because the internet, whilst platforming some awful shit and people, also needs a place where we can express weakness and not feel ashamed about it or be buried under it.

"I'm a short obese dude with a funny-looking mustache and glasses, with a below-average paying job - and I've still been in relationships and have had sex. All this talk about how being too short or too poor or too fat or too ugly just DOOMS you to lifelong virginity is nonsense.

I'm not saying it may not lower your chances, but the idea that you just can't ever get laid no matter what is just self-defeating pessimism. And I mean, from experience, having sex wasn't this magical event that changed who I was or how I felt about myself. Yeah, it felt good, but I didn't feel like a ""more complete person"" afterward or anything. 

Virginity is nothing to be ashamed of, and while I understand the desire to experience sex, it isn't something that should be held up as the end-all-be-all of human experience. Live your life and try to enjoy yourself, whether you're sexually active or not. Hinging so much importance on sex isn't healthy.",4,0,2018-08-17T22:34:14.000Z

"The incel attitude to attractiveness reminds me of the Christopher Hitchens 'women aren't funny' view that if men aren't handsome they're forced to be funny to attract women. Regardless of the obvious misogyny of it, I think the reason that this view struck such a chord with so many men was that it allowed the blame for their inability to get women to like them to be shifted somewhat. It perpetrated this idea that men have to pander to women with good looks or comedy in order to have sex with them, and that men (like our lord and rationalist saviour Chris Hitchens) who realise this are rising above it. It's easier to address your lack of success with women by blaming feminism or society or instincts, especially if this comes packaged with a good excuse to leave rape threats in the comments of every Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman clip on youtube.",1,0,2018-08-17T22:27:01.000Z

"Hey, awesome video like all of your content (I feel this channel is a true gem of youtube)
Sry i'm not a native speaker (i live in Germany). I would like to make a few remarks, because this topic kind of concerns me. I agree with a lot of your analysis. The language thing for incels is a tool for dehumanisation. The dating market is a market, no matter if you are online or irl even though it certainly does not reach the ridiculous and insane biological heights but it is a thing, which often gets neglected in (to borrow a term from one of your earlier videos) ""Pop Feminism"", which ties into the emergence of this new old misagony of the manosphere. Too often in liberal feminism womanhood is in the media reaffirmed as (just as) victimhood, which i think hurts the goals of gender equality. It basicly is the confirmation of the patriarchal sentiment, that women need to be protected (more then men) or are always innocent beings (in contrast to men). That women can't be offenders, women can't be sexist, women can't be wrong. While this worldview can reproduce itself on the theoretical level without contradiction, it cannot do that in practice. In dating (since second wave feminism became mainstream and watered down) there is actually a lot of hypocrisy in gender relations coming from the female side, while there is literally no protection or solidarity for men, who fall victim to that hypocrisy. So resentment festers into hatred and bounces back into a worse objectification of women in nerd circles. I think this needs to be taken into account.
Don't get me wrong a lot of the manosphere is utterly ridiculous and disgusting, but a man who is more feminine (which for me is not meant as bound to a certain gender, in the way of say a very quiet, introvert, passive behaviour) has far worse cards in finding a partner than a women with the same character. Moreover a passive woman does then have the opportunity to grow her character from the basis and support of a loving relationship because it still is seen as something natural. Of cours this does not happen in all relationships. Imagine it differently how many woman with a masculine character take that active role of a caregiver outside of motherhood? It is still more common for women to want that than it is for men to want that. There are men, who simply cannot set out to do the things People like Jordan B. Peterson want them to do. I'm writing that as someone who has seriously bad experience with dating which contributed to my selfloathing i'm still not really healed by even though i have made progress i think. But that progress only came with coping mechanisms (I became really invested into erotic art) until i finally found the courage to get rid off my virginity (though only bought, but it was such a relief).  One should not underestimate the impact of being dismissed by the desired gender. Queer people are more advanced with this problem then heterosexual people, i think: You can be masculine or feminine depending on your character not your assigned gender role.

Thanks for reading, keep up the great content. You actually made me realize that i am a bit genderdysphoric myself. Though i do not feel the urge to physically perform genderbending, i more often identify with women in media or role playing games (always female charactes if there is an option) and i absolutely hate hypermasculine competitiveness. My brain is female and i'm locked in a desire for a woman with more masculine character traits, which i can only fulfill in my fantasy. No cleaning my room will change that sadly and there some of the points incels perversly hint at, actually become visible for me in everyday life and you can't really talk to a lot of feminists about these issues because they created a safe zone for themselves and their beliefs centered around the guilt of men. In my troubles i got for example much more compassion from the men in my life than from the women.",0,0,2018-08-17T22:24:05.000Z

"I agreed with this video up until the point where she says ""Peterson is actually a good influence"", his not his really not, Peterson is actually is making thing worse not better. I think what people need to understand about the incel community is that it wasn't always like this. There was a time where the incel community was dare I say 'Intersectional' in which women were included in the community and it had a very low tolerance for the toxic rhetoric that we see today. Although, incels are toxic I do think their problematic behavior is in many ways an extension of mainstream attitudes about love and dating. The idea of ""sexual marketplace"" isn't just popular among the 'red pill' community, most people (i.e. ""normies"") actually believe in the ""sexual marketplace"" hypothesis and that's kind of the problem. I believe that we would be healthier as a society if we dismantled or at least challenged the idea of a ""sexual marketplace"" and maybe embrace the idea that love and attraction are not conditional.",3,30,2018-08-17T22:18:43.000Z

"Former incel here, although I (thankfully) didn't even know the term at the time that I was one. Still sure do wish I could forget my entire puberty though.

I've never agreed with much of their worldview and have never felt entitled to female attraction, so I guess I was kind of a free agent incel.

I grew up mouth breathing due to under-treated allergies, which allowed gravity to ruin the growth of my jaw, cheekbones and infraorbital rims (the small area between the cheekbones and lower eyelids) since my mouth (i.e. skull) was just hanging open 24/7 for my entire childhood and adolescence. All of my facial growth was warped by gravity to some extent, but those are the parts of my face that were basically destroyed. 

Having a gravity melted face has induced a sort of body dysphoria in me that may be comparable to being pre-transition, but instead of being the ""wrong"" whatever I just got a straight downgrade. I think it's tough to say who has it worse, male or female childhood mouth breathers; the damage is absolutely staggering for either.

And for the record I think your nose is probably the only thing that needs substantial work. The difference between ideal male and female bone structure is surprisingly small; hair and makeup are seriously a good 70-80% of the difference. Bone reduction is kinda dicey because if you get too much taken off you're basically fucked, so make sure you really understand facial aesthetics before pulling the trigger on it.",4,3,2018-08-17T22:00:54.000Z

"Looking back at the kind of lonely angry teenager I was, I can bet I would've been part of the incel club if it existed back then. And if I could give some advice to these guys, I would say :
1. Your biggest problem isn't your bone structure or your ""shitty personality"", it's probably an emotional incompetence.
2. Cumulating emotional incompetence with the ""shitty personality"" of a whacky theorist who blames women for everything isn't exactly what your life needs.
3. Look inward instead of judging the rest of the world. Therapy or deep introspection might help to figure out what went wrong with your emotional development/your ability to socialize.
4. Stop putting pressure on yourself to find a partner TODAY, at any cost. Learn to be ok with who you are before searching for people who will accept you as you are.
5. Stop looking up to pick-up artists and abusive men who just intend to be good at deceiving, manipulating and objectifying women. Don't aspire to become an awful person !
6. Use the internet to learn more about the female perspective. Women will give you a more valuable insight on your awful habits than the other lonely guys who will just enable them.

To me the last point is very important because we, idiot loners, tend to downplay how being an anxious creep is perceived by other  people compared to the impact of our appearance on our social life. Being positive, relaxed around other people and evidently comfortable in your own skin isn't a dating trick. These are just huge indicators of a healthy mindstate. I won't pretend that working on your long-lasting anxieties is easy and quick but it's clearly the only way to go.

I'm happy that you made a (fantastic) video about this, Natalie. I feel like it has been a polarizing subject where people feel the need to either vilify or enable ""incels"" while most of these buttheads probably just need to understand what's wrong with their daily behaviour and how disconnected they are to the outside world. Whatever if they take a look at this vid or not, this is some honest and illuminating shit right here.",52,4,2018-08-17T21:38:20.000Z

"I think another reason so many people fall into the incel trap isn't masochism actually, it's that it's just so much easier to blame all your problems on things you have no control over. It takes away all the responsibility you have as a person to actually improve and become a person that women would enjoy being around. If you can blame women and skull structures and society itself for your problems you never have to admit that you're kind of just a boring dude who doesn't try very hard and has an unappealing personality. It's just simpler to wallow in self pity than it is to actually try to improve your life.",1,0,2018-08-17T21:37:31.000Z

"I can't shake the feeling that all this Incel business is just a joke taken too far. This is precisely the type of bullshit ideology I'd invent to channelise my frustration about my inability to form or hold (or want, if I'm honest) relationships. And it does fit the bill I must say. I quite like self-depreciating humour, so when first I heard the term and its description, my reaction was: hehe, that's me. Even as I learned more and more about this I saw no foul, because I just didn't think about the one possibility that would take all the fun out of harebrained theories and ridiculous jargon to go with it, which would be that:
They're serious.
And it's so ridiculous I still can't really believe it. Just too much on the nose. So I'm guessing that all this is fuelled by types not dissimilar to me - people with a taste for self-irony, albeit far more destructive and less empathetic, exploiting the truly frustrated (and I dare say none too intelligent) by having them ridicule themselves. Come on, Chads, Stacies, Femoids, *cells - that can't be serious, right? That just stinks of parody. I have played this kind of cruel joke on the weaker-minded myself, indulging their frustrations and stupid beliefs to make fun of them by having them explain their standpoint. I'm not proud of that, but I guess anyone with a barest amount of intellectual arrogance does so. In fact I saw total morons doing that to people even stupider then themselves. So I'm afraid I can't be nearly as sympathetic as you, as it seems to me that we're talking just about a bunch of weak-minded victims of frustration egged on by only slightly less weak-minded people with toxic personalities, and it's all gotten out of hand.",1,0,2018-08-17T21:19:08.000Z

"Great video, there's a lot of think pieces on incels and this is one of the few takes I've seen that's level headed but appropriately critical. This shit is so funny to me because I grew up as a small nerdy kid and turned into what some might perceive as ""a Chad"" because I didn't sit around hating myself. Honestly the whole incel movement unintentionally gives me confidence. Like I used to be really self conscious about my hair thinning and would be really torn up about it because I felt like I was losing apart of myself, then one day I saw how incels throw pity parties for themselves over the exact same thing because they think it means they'll never get laid and it kinda gave me a sense of ""at least I'm not those guys."" Now I don't even care about my hair, when it's time for me to shave it off I will and I'll own it because it's better to do that then cry about it and not accomplish anything with my life other than hating myself. Also helps that I have had many close friends who are women and as a result see them as actual people and not just fiends who won't have sex with me.",3,0,2018-08-17T21:07:13.000Z

"I think the problem with incels is they think that sex is the same as having an intimate connection or relationship with someone. Furthermore they're jealous that girls can get lots of messages on dating apps, but they don't realize that very few men on those apps are looking to date. All they care about is getting it in for one night. And most girls I've seen on tinder are trying to find relationships, not just one night stands... so i feel bad for the girls too. These guys dont care about them or their interests. The incel mentality is similar - all that matters is sex, not intimate connection or love. That's where their pain comes from.",13,2,2018-08-17T21:05:54.000Z

"This really resonated with me. I can count myself lucky that I'm too old to have been in the Incel movement. I think I would have been had it been available to me when I was younger. I certainly believed I was Incel at the time.
I'm an Autistic, short, overweight man with a wonky nose, a long list of mental health issues and self inflicted scars on my face.

I'm currently married with 2 kids but I'm by no means a ""chad"" and I've only had sex with the one person. I lost my virginity at 23. When I did it, wasn't exactly the ""movie scene"" that I had expected. it was more of an ""Ikea furniture with no instructions"" experience.

Looking at myself before I was 23, itsclear to me now what was causing me to be incel. It was me.

I sabotaged myself. I was intensely worried about my sexual performance and I was terrified of women. 

I formed intense crushes on a random woman and then silently had an imaginary relationship with her (often lasting years). I'd then reject any """"unattractive"" woman for the tiniest blemish and imperfection.  

The incel mindset is self fulfilling. You see yourself as being forced into celibacy, you build up a series of character flaws that make you even less attractive. Come to think  of it, having imaginary relationships with someone is more than little creepy.

Changing it means doing something very difficult but not outside of the realm of possibility for anyone. 

Introspection.
You need to accept yourself as you are. Identify the ways you sabotage yourself and what the root causes are. (For me ED was a massive worry)

Also
Let go of the crushes, lower the standards, focus on what's in your control.

"Why are incels how they are?  

Loneliness.  

And there's something inside me, probably comes from watching too much Game Grumps that makes we want to see you do a Let's Play of Super Seducer with Lindsay Ellis.  

I always had the suspicion that Roosh V was a Master Baker (not even Anti-Social Media would claim that joke)  

On a more serious note, I'd also like to see you and Lindsay also like to do a Let's Play of _Everlasting Summer._  

I think that game kind of shows what it's like to be a lonely young shut-in.  

And as a colourblind straight white man, you've got me changing the IKEA colour strip from a golden yellow (I think, I'm brown/green colourblind) to PAAAAAAAANK!!!!!

And as a straight man, I think I've used the phrase ""you confuse my boner, hon"" before you transitioned.  I feel a bit guilty knowing that this is probably still affecting you negatively now.  I guess this is why I say that I'm ...latently transphobic... :C

That's the thing about incel forums, they won't even allow women on their forums.  

And the thing is, this is nothing new.  I had feelings about women similar to this when I was in my twenties, I actually too pleasure in rejecting them because I had been rejected for a lot of my life.  

Before the incels was the Loveshy community, before Loveshy there was the soc.men newsgroup.  

And I went to those communities looking for answers...

...but I left very quickly because I wasn't going to get answers, I wasnt going to get self-improvement, basically, what you said.  

I had problems that I wanted to solve.

My biggest fear came when I confessed to my boyfriend, whom I've been seeing online (no, he's not a serial killer, and I'm not a trap or catfish) for a few months at that point, that I was a pre-op, pre-HRT transwoman. At first he was confused and heartbroken, but he kept saying he wanted me to be who I wanted to be and that I had his support, and then after a very emotional discussion, he said that he still loved me and realized that he truly did and he didn't care that I wasn't assigned female at birth or even that I wasn't post-op yet -- he loves me for me.

"About a couple of years ago i was invited into a discord server for fans of a then inactive youtube channel that used to have a bit of a cult following on 4chan when i was an edgy teen. well, when i joined the server it was full of the people youd expect to see on 4chan now. general bigots, reactionary, and outright fascists. after a short while most of the more moderate people left, because, well, nazis just arnt nice to be around. but not me, i stuck at it. I stayed talking to these people for about 6 months or so, and even made a few friends with them in spite of the vast ideological chasm between us, and the constant arguments we had. it was interesting, as we all got to know each other a bit more the conversations developed from just shitposting and talking about hobbies, to actually talking about our daily lives, our relationships, a bit more personal stuff.

These people would not themselves identify as incels, but did occupy the same spaces as them, and often had very similar ideas about women and relationships. And let me tell you, it was genuinely horrifying to see the way they talk about people in their lives, and the women they interact with and how their worldview is such an obvious hurdle to any form of empathy or a genuine human connection with someone of the opposite sex. Its weird seeing it close. I almost have sympathy for the world they have created for themselves, but honestly, its the hell they deserve. they arnt changing their minds any time soon, and they are a serious threat to anyone they see as degenerate, which includes me btw, something they didnt shy away from mentioning. We could be civil, share jokes, and even have emotional conversations, but when push comes to shove, i genuinely believe they have made their mind up about me, and a lot of people i love. And it aint looking good for us. 

Really great video Natalie, fantastic work as always. you give me a little bit of hope and joy on this whole mess.",0,0,2018-08-17T20:39:26.000Z
"Why do people seek out abusive comments? I think it has to do with anxiety. People don't want to acknowledge the anxieties they have about themselves as being irrational or untrue. Maybe because of an unfounded belief that if it wasn't true, they wouldn't believe it, or maybe it just seeps in due to exposure to this anxiety, who knows? And in some ways, abuse can feel cathartic. Yeah, it's harmful, but it also proves that you were right to be anxious. That sucks, but it's a narrative that makes sense, and more importantly, it can give a sense of certainty to a situation that had an uncomfortable lack of it before. I think there is something inherently stressful about not knowing the answer to some things, that it's actually much easier to *know* something awful is true than suspecting it might be false but never being sure. But, at least in my experience, convincing yourself that your anxieties are true doesn't actually stop the anxiety long-term. In fact, it usually makes them worse. And so it can lead to that death spiral, where it's easy to get sucked further and further in.

I also think that part of the twisted appeal of something like incels is that it combines this anxious pessimism with an absolution of responsibility. It basically says, ""Yeah, every bad thing you worried other people were thinking is true. But that's not your fault! You're the victim in all this! Which is appealing on a like a dozen levels. It also requires no work and doesn't have a chance to fail, which makes it feel *certain*. And because the primary thing they are told to do about this is alternatively nothing or suicide, nothing ever changes or gets better, and suddenly the only way to get relief from the anxiety and fear becomes to further isolate yourself in this one community of people that *get it*.

That said, even understanding why (or at least one theoretical possibility for why) and going through similar cycles, it's hard to sympathize with incels. There are lots of ways to deal with anxiety and depression, and most of them don't involve being a massive prick to everyone who isn't like you.",1,0,2018-08-17T20:39:12.000Z

So it makes me amazingly happy to hear them come out of her lips. Because it confirms that I'm not alone in all the hatred I've managed to internalize. Because it takes away the shameful secretive power of the thoughts I've never been able to explain to others. And because it shows how bitter, and small and ordinary is that thought, coming off of so many bitter and small and ordinary characters' lips. Well, maybe they aren't so ordinary. But they aren't monsters, they're humans who are silly and who I can imagine forgiving. I can suddenly imagine forgiving myself, too, for all the hateful things I think to myself.

"This turned out to be much longer than I intended and is going to get drowned in the sea of comments but whatever.

I'm currently doing my phd using an anonymous image board for NEET shut-ins as data. Turns out it has a lot of overlap with the incel community and I basically have to immerse myself daily in misogyny and self-loathing for a living. Imagine that...

I actually have some more sympathy for incels than Natalie has. Their worldview is not just some delusionary construction. They're reacting to real trends in the dating market (and, yes, it CAN be conceptualized as a market). There's a LOT of research literature on so called ""mate preferences"" and dating that utilizes surveys, online dating data, experimental speed-dating settings and data on real relationship patterns. There's also some research on adult virginity and its correlates and predictors. And many of the trends (excluding misogynistic views about women of course) incels complain about are basically true, although they are typically statistical tendencies and incels exaggerate a lot.

My point: blaming individuals for their miserable success in the dating market is empirically incorrect. Many features that affect your dating life are out of your control or only controllable to a certain extent. Moreover, because of women tending to have less interest in dating and sex than men do, skewed local sex ratios and dating-relevant demographic stratification along, for example, class lines there is going to be, by structural necessity, a group of people (usually men) who want a partner but can't get one. Surveys also reveal that there indeed is a small minority of people (mostly men) who remain sexually inexperienced throughout their lives.

Our problem as leftists is that we give totally opposite messages with regard to the economic market and the dating market. Whereas we allow people to be victims of circumstances when it comes to unemployment, for example, the same doesn't hold for the dating market where we typically moralize incels for being entitled and focus on individual responsibility. ""You would find love eventually if you stopped being so bitter and actually tried harder"" is really not that different from ""get a job"".

Another problem is that we basically don't have a solution to the incel problem. Socialism isn't going to provide everyone a satisfying sexual or love life. Economic equality will help (because it's known to affect real dating, cohabiting and marriage patterns) but it won't eliminate the problem - there will always be people who are going to have a really hard time trying to find a loving partner and may never succeed and just simply give up and end up lonely, self-hating and angry. And in so far as this translates into misogyny, as it has done so far, hatred of women will continue in these dark corners of the internet under socialism.

Feminists don't have a solution either. Incels actually break many male stereotypes and their biggest crime seems to be that they demand women to desire them as they are: ugly, fat, short, boring, mentally ill, insecure, autistic and socially inept, poor, unemployed, uneducated, non-white or whatever else they (relatively realistically) describe themselves as. Hence, they don't subscribe to the masculine ideal of ""earning"" love from a woman by being a certain desirable type of a man. That's why we criticize them for being ""entitled"". If you want love and sex, you have to earn it. That's not a standard that we place as heavily on women who typically occupy the (undesired) role of being sexual gatekeepers.

""Being loved as who you are"" is also not some morally terrible demand, quite the opposite. The problem is that sexual desire just doesn't work that way - not all people have desirable features - and we all know it. I suspect that on top of the obvious (and correct) criticism of the violence and misogyny, some of the intensely moralistic reactions to incels are basically due to the guilt women (and men) feel about who they desire and who they don't desire. There's a need to project that guilt onto people who complain about others' dating preferences and here incels' (very real) misogyny comes in handy: ""See, they're evil, I'm not to blame.""

Curiously incels also tend to blame ""toxic masculinity"" on women, although they don't say it that way. It goes like this: if only women didn't run after dominant and bad guys and keep rewarding them with sex we wouldn't have these restrictive and destructive social roles for men. There's actually SOME truth to this. Some women really do place toxic standards on men. The problem is the obvious fakeness of these claims. Although incels complain about women's dating preferences, many of them would much rather live in a world where they're on top of the hierarchy (hence the authoritarian fantasies). It's like they want to have the cake and eat it too.",0,2,2018-08-17T20:15:20.000Z
"This video was disappointing to me, as a natal female cis non-trans woman (for real). You should've hit the misogyny point way harder. To take on a group of people who notoriously hate women and are probably neutral towards trans women, and turn it around to make your viewers feel bad for YOU as a trans woman is insensitive at best, and purposely misogynistic at worst. Where do women go to ""digital self-harm""? Well, for me and many other women it was red pill forums and, before it was deleted, r/incels. They have ways of hating my very genitals that triggered my self loathing like no one else could. I have noticed in past videos, esp ""autogynophilia"" that you are uninformed of the struggles and the lives of real women. This video made it very clear that obsessing over your far right man-cels has deprived you of educating yourself about the largest class of oppressed persons, women.

"I think a lot of people seek out negative places like that incel thread you mentioned, because that kind of cynicism can justify their passiveness. As long as they get reassured that they're 'doomed' to be incels, they can avoid feeling guilty for not acting. 
As soon as they accept that they're just normal looking men who could find love if they tried, they'd have to acknowledge that they have some responsibility for their situation, and that they could change it, if they just bothered. To avoid that guilt, to avoid taking responsibility for even a little part of their misery, they seek out those horribly negative threads that validate their passivity.

And that is by no means an 'incel thing', to some degree we all do that. I know it took me years to acknowledge that I wasn't responsible for getting OCD, but I was responsible for not trying to improve it. I'd look up negative social media posts that mocked the advice people give for mental health, the posts dismissing therapy, medication, anything that has been proven to help, because as long as I did that, I never had to go through the very emotionally painful work of improving my mental health.",31,5,2018-08-17T20:06:53.000Z

"I used to be an incel long before it was cool, just as I was a neo-fascist before it was cool (thanks Jobbik and Fidesz).

I was under the influence of my father's philosophy, which was very similar to Jordan B Peterson's, only he uses wolves instead of lobsters and fruit eating monkeys, he doesn't know about the Myers-Briggs personality types so he uses astrology, and has a very fucked-up political view that mixes Stalinism with eugenics, racism, and weed. He pretty much made me to hate my mother with a passion for a while. I also really feared to make any contract with girls of my age (I was a teen) as I feared that I could end up in a bad divorce, I was a metal elitist and wanted a big tiddy metalhead gf who didn't smoke or listen to those godawful Hungarian alt-rock bands, etc.

Funny thing is that it was anime that slowly saved me. Spice and Wolf introduced me to a slightly different relationship dynamics, that was enough to kick me out from my father's misogynistic propaganda (also from antisemitic conspiracy theories, since now I had an alternative to them in the form of economics). Others include Revolutionary Girl Utena (which made it clear to me that it's okay to converge from gender norms) and Vandread (which is a sexist trash, but unintentionally destroyed any leftover gender separatism inside me since it made fun of that).

After almost ten years, I still don't have any advances towards women. Most people who aren't ultranationalist and had the chance already left the country, while I stuck here thanks to my college, not being able to get an internship which is required for my degree. So most that are still here are trad-women, which make me puke. While incels would be turned on by their submissiveness (until they realize that these trad-women are probably the closest thing to the gold-digger stereotype), I'm instantly turned off by how they excuse ""discipline"" (which is emotional abuse and smacking your wife) and even martial rape. The fact that I live in probably the worst area of Hungary and have autism doesn't help anything. However I no longer need to form an identity around it. I probably could start a ""leftcel"" movement while blaming heteronormative white-supremacist capitalism instead of rampant feminism. I'm bisexual and my family is very bigoted, I cannot currently imagine that if I get a boyfriend instead of a girlfriend, or a Roma or Asian partner, I'll be allowed to live with my parents, which is necessary since I cannot find a job that's not in a city where the rent costs more than the minimum wage, so I have to live in whatever sweatshop factory provided housing, probably with 12 beds per room.",0,0,2018-08-17T20:01:59.000Z

"What incels remind me of a lot is the male version of the pro-ana websites. Those things convince a 15-year-old girl with low self-esteem that the best way to become attractive, develop willpower, and gain control over her life is to starve herself. This sometimes leads to death. The incel boards convince a 15-year-old male virgin with low self-esteem that the best way to gain some measure of control over his life is to accept the fact that he will never have sex or any kind of intimacy with a woman and will lead a dark, depressing and hopeless life. This can sometimes lead to suicide or, in rare cases, murder. 
   Most teenagers have low self-esteem and think they are ugly or weird, and most of the teenagers around them mirror this back because they to have low self-esteem. It is perfectly normal to be a virgin into your twenties, especially now, when conservative trends of all sorts are back in style.  Short guys, poor guys, autistic guys, guys with drug problems, can all get laid and even get girlfriends sooner or later. I know, because I have been all of those things. 
Granted, I have a good chin, but still.

"Great video Contra, although there's one important point I think you overlooked. As someone who has had self-esteem issues relating to women, dating, desiriability, etc. I think a good deal of it comes from the false ideas pushed onto vulnerable kids and teenagers from the steaming shitpile that is mass media. I can remember watching teen movies, listening to pop songs, etc. and feeling like I *had* to ""get the girl"" or ""get laid by hot chicks"" to be happy, because all of these attractive men on a screen in front of my face were, and so that if I didn't do that I would somehow be ""failing as a human."" Obviously, I think a good chunk of incels have been similarly brainwashed, and the idea that there can legitimately be more to a relationship than just superficial sex or Hollywood-style """"""perfect romances"""""" is totally alien to them. In their heads, if they're not in a relationship or not having sex constantly with Stacies, they've failed their fundamental task as a male, and hence have nothing to feel good about. If the movies, songs, books, etc. we were exposed to growing up portrayed more grounded, heartfelt and nuanced depictions of sex and relationships (instead of the lame ""boy meets girl, girl solves all of boy's problems"" usually in these things) a lot of young men and even women would have a healthier attitude towards going out and relating to the opposite sex.",1,0,2018-08-17T19:56:51.000Z

One thing I would say is missing, maybe you disagree is that some of the information that incels use is valid. Hypergamy is represented in data, so is racial bias as well as many other issues. My main point here is for every 9 pieces of ludicrous information that a hate group uses, theres 1 piece of valid information, talking about an issue that gets ignored because of its association with the hate group. This valid information could act as the hook that drags more rational people into the group and have a toxic effect on their mind as you noted happening to yourself.

"I would be an incel, if I hadn't gotten laid that one time, and if I didn't channel all my sexual frustration into Stalin worshipping and capitalism-hating.

I'm not kidding either. What I believe about the world is pretty close to incelism qualitatively, although much more moderate. TL;DR incels tend make absolute, immutable laws out of things that are really just strong tendencies at best.

According to my theory, both the Manosphere and feminism - in their most reasonable iterations - are complaining about the same exact problem: Paleo-Fascism.

Paleo-fascim is simply the cultural baggage of our agrarian history.

For most of human agrarian history, the most efficient way to survive as a society was to force men into the army to wage war for land and force women to pump out babies.
As humans usually do, we mythologized things we need to do in order to survive, and decided to pretend they were a God-given natural order, that the highest thing a man could aspire to was to be a warrior-king with a harem(Chad), and that a woman could only please Providence by devoting her life to being a baby-dispenser for a rich man, never working so that she doesn't endanger her unborn children.(Stacy)
This ideology is dehumanizing and degrading to men and women both, obviously, but it promoted survival. And social mores always filter down from the social top to the Proles below.

Incelism is just this same ideology dressed in modern clothes.

The reason incelism exists is because not nearly as much has been done to dismantle and discredit ideas of paleo-fascit masculinity as has been done to discredit paleo-fascist femininity. Paleo-fascist maculinity is still significantly sought after by many women, if women's porn is anything to go on at least...cough50shadesCough a lot of women really are kinda hypergamous, for socioeconomic status especially.

So these poor bastards(incels), who are also probably from towns where all the factories have moved to China, look at everyone around them: ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQI etc. suddenly getting talked about and supported for their suffering, while nobody talks about them, and their very real suffering, caused by failure to be Chads/Warrior-kings, and also probably not having enough money to go to college.

So in stead of questioning paleo-fascist masculinity, they embrace it even harder. From there they can take two roads: 

1)blame themselves/fate, and become hateful, rotting incels.

2)blame marginalized groups for their failure to achieve warrior-king status. They just need SOMEONE to pin the blame on, so they naturally get attracted to anti-semites, who have a long tradition of blaming everying on the Jews. Why not this also, if it's a way to get recruits?

Or they end up like me, using youtube and historical materialist analysis to blame ancient history and capitalism for my underfuckedness.",0,0,2018-08-17T19:29:53.000Z

"What about negatively viewing Human promiscuity in general? Premarital/pre-engagement sex is wrong, amoral, and degenerate to oneself and society.

You act like 'divorce rape,' gold diggers, and the Duluth model don't exist. When one demographic can completely destroy another's without evidence or their legally binding word that's not equality or oppression, that's supremacy. I'm pretty sure this is exactly what To Kill a Mockingbird was all about. If the 'justice' system is stacked against blacks it's not a leap to apply that to other demographics like asians, hispanics, or men. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2565377/Shocking-video-girlfriend-throwing-car-released-grand-jury-declines-indict-judge-boyfriend-accused-assault.html That went to a grand jury before the case was thrown out.

Caricatures are an accurate way to assess and express reality. Take one of my favorite books for example, The Great Gatsby. Tom and Daisy are absolutely caricatures of not only wealth but the Chad/Stacy dynamic; Let alone hypergamy and the Human desire for leisure. It's the same thing with Big Red, Trigglypuff, Tabby, and Fritz.

"Great video as always Natalie!

at 13:58 As bad as this sounds, I understand the feelings of 1-5. As a teen boy even normal conversations with girls were incredbily hard, and the idea of actually getting the courage to ask a girl out just seemed out of the question. It just felt like the odds were stacked against me. That said, I quickly understood that this had chip I had on my shoulder had NOTHING to do with ""feminism"" or a woman's right to choose her own romantic partners. I realized I had a right to be frustrated at the SITUATION of being alone and being single (which I later would find out would be a combination of anxiety/OCD and depression), but I had NO RIGHT to be angry at women for who they find or don't find to be attractive.

I've been down the road of isolation and loneliness, but I didn't let my self-pity lead me down a road of hatred for literally half of the god damn human population. That doesn't even just make me a decent person. It just makes me a person capable of looking at women as more than fucking objects or animals. 

As for this idea that most girls just want a ""Chad"", I would argue that most girls are much less shallow than guys when it comes to picking the attributes they find desirable in person they're attracted to. I think, in reality, what makes a ""Chad"", has more to do with confidence than bone structure. (Plus, treating women like humans being also helps.) Of course natural looks play a role, but I think woman are much more forgiving of physical attributes than guys are.",1,0,2018-08-17T19:20:52.000Z

""This kind of hatred just needs a spark to turn to violence""

:/ I'm conflicted about this viewpoint. I would need more context to get a full picture however.

But I would make the following observations.

A rant can often function as making clear the worse possible interpretation that lives in your head, and making it visible to the rest of your mind to be made more nuanced and disproved.
In and off itself I don't see people expressing these viewpoints as dangerous.

Surely these viewpoints are better visible to the people who hold them and to a degree to the rest of society. By saying something you may see that it is absurd and unjustified - and in my experience there is nothing that makes you *less* critical of someone that just going overboard with a perhaps unjustified criticism.

The question of course is in what context this discussion takes place. Is within a setting that places such rather negative viewpoints in context and mitigates them? Or is it within a circle of hate that stifles rational thought.

But I'm *really really* suspicious of viewpoints that say ""anger is bad, criticism is wrong, you must control you anger etc etc"" - because it doesn't necessarily make people less angry it just prevents them to fully working out precisely what they are angry about whether it is reasonable. And I really think this is part of a more general narrative that says ""all (male?) anger is unjustified and dangerous"".",0,5,2018-08-17T19:17:04.000Z

"I think that the ""call everyone pretty"" mentality isn't as bad as you make it out to be, necessarily. I think, sometimes, everyone needs to hear a compliment, even if it's not particularly genuine. This is something that most parents do, as an example, telling their children ""Oh, you're so handsome/pretty""... The compliment, such as it is, is more about the effort being put in than the actual results, and that can be good because continual application of effort leads to improvement.

Now, with that said, there are also times where constructive criticism is called for.

My opinion, though, is that typically, neither random compliments nor constructive criticism should be given by random internet strangers, unless you're specifically looking and asking for such. I think it's a bit creepy when an audience tells someone how pretty they are in the comments of a video, just like I find it inappropriate when they give unsolicited advice (and this is regardless of whether the statements are true or false, and also applies more generally - I don't like how the comments of any woman's Youtube section invariably includes comments on how sexy she is, or what have you).

In a group of a thousand people there has to be someone who is the worst.  Life is tough for everyone but for that worst of the worst it must really suck.  Incels and Trans are humans and deserve our support.  Focusing on the very top and very bottom is a strange thing for people and society.

"I think you should have read between the lines a little more.  This isn't about sex, it's about companionship, and even  more deeply, it's about the desire to find reciprocated love. Sex just happens (NOT ALWAYS) to be a physical manifestation of love; broken down even further this is about the role of masculinity which--fuck your feminist bullshit--is a biological role of the male reproductive role. Protector, Patriarch, Leader, Doer, etc.

This is why women overwhelmingly look for men who are taller than them at a minimum if not just tall period. It gives a sense of security, no matter how empty that security might be.  This is an expression of the male reproductive role as Protector as validated by women.

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201306/why-women-want-tall-men

I think where ""incel"" phenomenon comes in is the roles for males in our society have become artificially obsolete through the Welfare Empire and Feminist Laws examples: VAWA, family courts, and Duluth Model. The results are self-evident in the fertility rate.",1,0,2018-08-17T19:08:48.000Z

"I am a real fan of this video. I really appreciate the philosophical depth used when engaging this topic, and you show a heartening respect for accuracy that I find enlightening (and rare when considering this topic).


On the topic of ""why do people engage in digital self-harm"". I might put forward a few more positive framings:

i. To confront the most extreme version of an argument (""He who knows only his own side of the case, knows little of that."")
ii. To confront the most extreme insults society has to throw at them, and see that they do nothing.
iii. To understand what drives the people who hate them and see them as absurd.
iv. So that people don't *lie to them*.

Why do this together with people like yourself? To make clear that it is a game, so that it's not real.

I think this might be seen as broadly analogous to exposure therapy, learning self defense, seeking out the strongest argument against your position.

I would prefer this as the minds attempt to ""seek out what it doesn't understand"" rather than an ""attempt to self harm"". Although... I see that you might want to equip people with the cognitive and logical tools to engage in this sort of activity ""safely"". I'm not sure I'm a fan of viewpoints of human behavior that say ""people are just irrational"".

Additionally, I would note that there are perhaps less toxic environments to learn these places. Even if one wants to deal with the most toxic form of an argument perhaps one wants to *start* somewhere nicer. E.g. People don't fight against black belts when they start learning self defense.",0,0,2018-08-17T18:49:08.000Z

While incels arent entitled to companionship or sex what we can do is help them develop their social skills so they can become a more likable person so they have better chances at finding a companion and so they can actually find a hobby and make friends.",20,7,2018-08-17T18:47:25.000Z

The parallels, especially in terms of self-loathing and self-harm, are undeniable.  In my case, I eventually did get laid (though not until I was 25), fall in love, and even get engaged- but of course that didn't ""fix"" me, and I wound up eventually needing to transition anyway (fortunately, my then-fiancee-now-wife wound up liking me better as a girl).   Nowadays, I'm a happily married, post-transition trans lesbian living her life- but I will admit, I'm still prone to some of the digital self-harm.

The origin of the word, ‚Äúkoro,‚Äù is connected to the Malaysian term for the retracting of a turtle‚Äôs head. Upon complete retraction of the body part in question, death is the feared consequence. The first descriptions of koro-like symptoms (with some similarity to panic disorder symptomatology) can be found in ancient Chinese medical records that are over two thousand years old. Although koro is often thought to be a disorder associated with Asian populations, cases in other parts of the world have been regularly reported. Moreover, koro can occur as individualized cases or full-blown epidemics. Certain indigenous treatment practices can be dangerous, and several means of treating the possible conditions underlying koro are discussed.",0,0,2018-08-17T18:30:51.000Z

"In my journey to stop all forms of self-harm I've engaged in and truly become a person I deem worthy of respect, love, affection, and all that mushy stuff, it always seems like there's a way to harm myself that I haven't yet addressed or even considered. Looking back, it's jarring to see how much damage I've caused to myself in such subtle, unnoticeable ways that's so plain to see now. I'm still struggling, but I can at least appreciate that it was never nearly as bad as it could have been, and that I've come a long way.

"A largely semi-desert country, Chad is rich in gold and uranium and stands to benefit from its recently-acquired status as an oil-exporting state.
1883-93 - Sudanese adventurer Rabih al-Zubayr conquers the kingdoms of Ouadai, Baguirmi and Kanem-Bornu, situated in what is now Chad.

1900 - France defeats al-Zubayr's army, completing its conquest in 1913. Chad becomes a colony.

1960 - Chad becomes independent with a southern Christian, Francois - later Ngarta - Tombalbaye, as president.

1963 - The banning of political parties triggers violent opposition in the Muslim north, led by the Chadian National Liberation Front, or Frolinat; three years later this revolt develops into a fully-fledged guerrilla war.

1973 - French troops help put down a revolt in the Muslim north.

1977 - Libya annexes the northern Chadian Aouzou strip, and sends in troops in 1980 to support President Goukouni Oueddei.

1990 - Coup leader Hissene Habre toppled by former ally, Idriss Deby.

2011 - Presidential election, boycotted by opposition. President Idriss Deby is declared winner.

2016 - Ex-ruler Hissene Habre is convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life in prison at a landmark trial in Senegal",1,0,2018-08-17T18:25:35.000Z

I've moved away from the worst of those boards now, but when I was younger I think I did use those boards in that way. It was also fuelled by a need to make sense of the very real bigotry that I witnessed and experienced growing up- but using the 'if it hurts its true' definately led me to lose alot of independant thought and generally be a bit (read: a lot) of a twat.

"When I was a teenager, I was consistently frustrated by my lack of success with women. I was the prototypical ""good guy""; always angry about how women went for the ""bad boys"" and unable to understand why they weren't interested in someone who would treat them with respect. It wasn't until my mid 20's that I had an epiphany and realized how messed up my world view had been. I realized that there had actually been tons of women my age interested in a relationship with me, I had just been ignoring them because they weren't the women I was interested in. I realized that these women were interested because I was actually being myself around them, telling jokes, sharing stories, hanging out together, etc, and this meant they actually had an idea of who I was. I realized that the 'respect' and 'chivalry' with which I approached the women I wanted to date was actually creating a front and preventing them from getting to know who I was. I mean, it seems like common sense now but, at the time, I legitimately did not understand that women wanted to be with someone they could connect with and understand and that, by hiding behind this facade, I was my own worst enemy.",21,1,2018-08-17T18:17:06.000Z

"A little (science based) take on gender that has me considering more seriously a socialist attitude to male violence and prison's ect... - this actually made me tear up a bit, if I'm being honest. Basically should isolation be a benchmark for ""pain""?

No need to reply. I would say no need to read - but it has taken me a long long time to form this opinion in this way (this is like my 4th or 5th revision of it this week)

It was actually a reply (tangentially) to a Steve Shives video regarding whether we are alone in the universe. Olly from Philosophy Tube will be touching on this as well (I think?) concerning addressing problems with behaviourism by using phenomenological approaches.

Cheers :)


Is anybody out there....?

I am wondering if the question ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt people question things?‚Äù could be related to the question ‚Äúdo men cope with social isolation better than women?‚Äù But on that last question, should I instead be asking ‚Äúdo men and women who have experienced the same level of social isolation behave in the same way afterwards?‚Äù

 

I could explain quite a lot about that - well not explain, but detail a lot of research (like hundreds of pages). Even though I am not a behaviourist (if that really means anything - but that approach hasn't helped LGBT people). And the later question ‚Äúdo men and women who have experienced the same level of social isolation behave in the same way afterwards?‚Äù is basically using a behaviourist approach. I am finding more of a basis for looking at behaviour.

 

You see. (looking at research published in science daily for example). It has been shown that isolation causes the increased expression of a gene that results in a build up of a neurotrasmitter (it has a complex name) in the hypothalamus and the amygdala. Tests have shown that blocking this neurotransmitter reduces feelings of fear, aggression and PTSD effects caused by isolation. While administering this neurtransmitter to those haven't experienced isolation will start to behave as if they have.

 

I could explain a lot about the biology. But, just to keep it short and to the point. Basically the hypothamalus has receptors for Vasopressin (which literally means ‚Äúexpanding blood vessels‚Äù - i.e. it increases blood pressure) and Serotonin (popularly thought to be a contributor to feelings of well-being and happiness... though it's complicated as too much of it can basically turn you into tub girl). With Vasopressin triggering a response from the hypothalamus associated with aggression, while serotonin's effect on the hypthalamus is associated with feelings of calmness.

 

It is difficult to isolate the cause in terms of nature vs nurture. But males do seem to have higher levels of Vasopressin than pre-menopausal women. Serotonin levels are higher in women versus men (while men synthesize serotonin faster than women). Also lower levels of Vasopressin seem correlated with higher levels of oxytocin (the ""Love Hormone""). There do seem to be sexually dimorphic nuclei in the brain that differentiate males from females and transgender people from cisgender people.

 

Indeed. While physical stress on mice seems to produce the same effect in males and females. It is females who seem more stressed than males by social osilation. As females produce more of the stress hormone corticosterone by the adrenal glands. In humans ""corticosterone"" has only minor effects. ""Cortisol"" - also produced by the adrenal glands - is the main hormone produced under stress in humans: papers on the effects of social hierarchy such as the famous ""white hall paper"" demonstrated how low status was associated with higher levels of cortisol stress hormone release (over-turning the conventional widsom of the time actually). It is known that women are reported as suffering twice as much as males when it comes to PTSD and anxiety (while men seem to suffer twice as much from mania and explosive anger disorders).

 

So it would seem - based on conventional wisdom - done and dusted: males cope with social isolation better than females.

 

But not so fast. Cortisol also acts as a steriod hormone in the body - in a similar way to androgens such as the ""male"" hormone testosterone. Indeed there is a condition called ""cushing's syndrome"" ‚Äì resulting from chronically elevated Cortisol - that causes male type body fat distribution and hair growth in females - i.e. cushing's syndrome is less noticeable in males (as it basically makes males look like the actor Danny Devito).

 

So it seems ""stress"" has a ""masculinizaing"" effect on the female body - which is why I am thinking about behaviour in terms of males and females rather than how males and females ""cope"" per say. I mean a lot of the effects of stress on males (that turn them into Danny Devito look-a-likes) could just be past off as the effects of testosterone. When in fact Cortisol reduces estrogen and testosterone levels - i.e. chronic levels of cortisol lead to problems with fertility.

 

So I repeat my original question: I am wondering if the question ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt people question things?‚Äù could be related to the question ‚Äúdo men cope with social isolation better than women?‚Äù But on that last question, should I instead be asking ‚Äúdo men and women who have experienced the same level of social isolation behave in the same way afterwards?‚Äù

 

Anyway. Thanks if you read all that. I went on way longer than I intended. Sorry.",3,0,2018-08-17T18:09:42.000Z

"Yeah, was not expecting a ""blast"" from the past from this vid. The digital self harm part of the vid made me understand incel a little more. Did not expect that.

As someone with an eating disorder, I used to visit specific websites where we posted selfies (wasn't called that at the time) to open up ourselves to the voices of the eating disorder masses. We did it partly because we needed the push to keep up the weight loss but mainly because being told we were already thin or looked great by people in your life felt like they were mocking you. You needed truth and on those forums you got that. Complete with its own terminology. It was addictive, having people rip you to shreds. Telling you where you was going wrong. Something... Purifying about it.

... So much so it drove you off the edge where the only thoughts running through your head were catastrophic. The tiniest imperfection (anything other than straight line) was picked out and thrown at you. What is literally bone sticking out was pointed out to you as fat you needed to lose (I was 7 stone). And if you was too weak to do what was necessary to be thin... Suicide posts were waiting for you, which was also encouraged.

""You're never going to be as thin as you need to be, so just die""

I had to do what you did Natalie and just block all those sites. Did it with a password I can't ever remember and made the process to undo the block as difficult as possible. Still have those blocks in place ten years later. Just to make sure that if my eating disorder pulled me down that much at least I can't access that hell again.",0,0,2018-08-17T17:54:49.000Z

I got dangerously close to some of this in my teens because my IRL prospects were nonexistant because I was a hyperemotional strange person. I was saved by making a lot of female friends on the internet and becoming a cyberslut. And while certain specific instances I would do vastly differently today due to other potentially problematic issues, on the whole I credit it for allowing me to develop a baseline appreciation and respect for women as human beings - the lack of which by so many continues to dusturb me.

I'm still a hyperemotional strange person, but I've learned to tone it down enough to actually talk with people - and I only really persue things with people who don't mind that I'm a hyperemotional strange person, preferably by being a hyperemotional strange person themselves which is incredibly sexy in a woman.

Like, even if people are completely satisfied with what I do, it basically means I'm doing everything right and I still feel like shit.  So there's got to be something bad, something I'm not doing correctly, something I can obsess over and fix, or at least blame.

What I like to do for other people is hide compliments in criticism.  I'm not sure if it actually helps, but I try to essentially build Trojan Horse criticisms, so they'll be more likely to take compliments seriously.  Like, if they ask you for your opinion on a paper they wrote, and you like it, you should still suggest *some* kind of edit, even if it's superficial, just so they feel like they got closer to figuring out what was wrong and fixed something.",0,0,2018-08-17T17:52:03.000Z

"This was beautiful buuuuut...I think it missed 2 crucial points that were seriously worth bringing up. 

First, sex doesn't appear to be what these guys obsess over as there are many posts that talk about opportunities that they've rejected.  What they seek is validation.  Some people often reccomend prostitution as a solution to their virgin status, but most reject it because sex is NOT what they want.  They want what supposed Chad's have, which is a cake-walk of a time getting the attention they want from women.  It's part of the reason so many of them refuse to improve.  Why work THAT hard when Chad doesn't have to?  Especially if they still might face rejection.

Second, not all women are created equally to them.  They seem to have a profound disgust for black women and an equally profound obsession with white and asian women.  Even in their misery-adled state, a black woman isn't good enough.  They'd rather die alone or commit suicide than be with a fat woman, woman of color, or a woman above a certain age.  Nothing less than a solid 9 or 10 aged 18 (or younger) white virgin female will do.  Elliot targeted a  valley girl sorority for a reason.

I wish you brought either of these things up.  This is honestly why I cant sympathize with them.  Most don't care about finding a partner.  It's about finding a partner than society deems the most valuable because a certain minority of men don't have to lift a finger to get them.  This, I think, is what makes them unworthy of an otherwise pretty open-hearted video.  Fuck them.  What you describe yourself going through is NOT what these asshats are so bent out of shape about.

I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but Elliott Rogers actually thought he deserved to win the lottery.  I am not kidding.  He obsessed over it and got really angry when he lost.  Nevermind that he had pretty well off parents.   He wanted more.  He wanted the best.  That's how incels in general are.  They see someone else win the lottery and ask themselves,  ""why should 'I' have to work when people are winning the lottery left and right? It's not fair!  I should be rich, too!""

I have two beautiful daughters, and, one day when they're older, guys like these will actually wish DEATH upon them simply because they might not be interested OR, if my daughters are interested, won't be seen as human because they are mixed.

"There's very few people in this earth that can't get laid. There are a lot of people on this earth who have a very hard time adjusting their standards to get them their desired result. 

For some people, getting laid isn't that important. I think oddly enough for others though. Having this identity of being celibate has given them their only group structure that accepts them in the world. So they reject change, or moving on in their life. They embrace anger instead of grow from it. That would be my guess. 

I walked away a few years ago. I don't know what I want in life, but I haven't found it in relationships. I personally found that women liked to keep me around to take care of things. To be a human doing, and not a human being. I haven't met one that valued me as much as I valued her. I am starting to wonder if that's possible, or worth trying for at this point in my life. The risk is far beyond the reward now that I'm not a young man any longer. For quite a while now dating hasn't been about sex. Sex isn't really that good with most women my age. They've been cavalier with their sexuality, and you get the idea. I spend more time dodging women my age and older now, than I do dating ever. Remember, women hold all the cards, the government will save them, and force men to help. Not the other way around. Woman also hold 60% of the debt right now. Why do you think the demonization of bachelor culture is so vibrant?

The whole thing is foreign to me, but at the same time. I have seen plenty of rejection when I was younger. So I can see somebody overreacting to it irrationally. I was ugly and strange, and I'm still not sure why I was successful with girls. Other than one thing. I just never gave up. I truly when I was younger believed that there were many fish in the seas. It worked. If one let me know she wasn't interested it was on to the next one I was interested in.


I wish that I had some idea to work off of. To get these young people to stop hating themselves for everything. So god damned much. That I think would be a good start to healing a lot of the wrong in society. I know it sounds stupid, but there is just so much self loathing for lack of a need to fight to survive.

"When I look at the incel community, despite all the misogyny and crimes associated with them, I can‚Äôt help but feel only pity and even empathy.

I‚Äôm in my late 30‚Äôs now, happily married with a daughter, but there was a time in my life where I was basically an incel before incels even existed.  I even obsessed about my chin and looked into what qualified for PUA‚Äôs at that time for advice on women.  And because of my lack of success and obsession with getting with a woman, I did start to perceive them as something fundamentally different from me.

But I guess with me, there were certain critical junctures of my life where I could have made decisions that would either lead me deeper into the incel hive of self loathing and hatred, or eventually lead me to a fulfilling relationship.  Thankfully, I wound up making the right decisions.

But these incel groups, they just encourage these kids to always make the wrong decision.  And you make that wrong decision enough times, you wind up suicidal.",10,1,2018-08-17T17:34:32.000Z

(Edited because i have a proper key board now)

Couple points of order, I used to debate with red pillers  on PPD, A) they find roosh v to be joke (not unlike how the alt right views Richard Spencer ie between a joke and controlled opposition), and they don't follow game or mystery, its way worse and game and mystery are tame in comparison. They follow people like rollo tomasi aka the rationale male among others. Mgtows favor sandman (for reasons beyond my mortal comprehension) or much smarter and better mgtows like stardust and/or bar bar. both much less cringey than sandman and easily have 20-30 iq points on sand man easily.  

Also everyone is hypergamous, but every discussing or debating red pill gets it wrong. Hypergamy has to do with status and while looks and money feed in to status they are not all there is to having status. Which everyone gets wrong. 

Also when discussing alphas  they talk about dark triad traits (DT) but altruism is positively selected for among women far more than DT. Also the mod over at ex red pill and i are friend and he is pursing masters in Evo psyche. tldr when psychological studies refer to dominance they mean social dominance, IE confidence and social skills not being a domineering (DT) brute; which is what a a lot red pillers think dominance means in terms of the EVo psyche research. 

Also risk of being cuckolded based on data is bimodal. Tldr if you think you might be a cuck you have a 1/3 chance of being right and if you don't think you are a cuck you have a 3%. Chance of being wrong.  (i think the postulated reason is if you think you might be a cuck you probably have a reason to think you might be a cuck and if you dont think you are cuck then you likely dont have a reason to think you are being cucked). so it happens more than we think it does but its not nearly as high red piller want to believe it is. which if we assume the cock carousel happens (for sake of argument) that means alphas are having a lot fruitless (high reproductive effort) sex (i knwo poor them right lol) and will be bread out because based on he cuckolding rates betas would reproduce at much higher rates which means evolution favors betas unless alphas are having lots of bastards (which may be the case in lower income communities).

So to recap women favor higher status (again status is vague and is not just looks and money) men, women preference (genuinely) altruistic  men who are social adept and confident. Well imagine my shock women are human.  oh and the beta will inherit the earth. 

Also MRas and puas do not get along nor are all MRas 'red piller' . There is over lap but based on subreddits drill down 5% red pillers are MRas and 15% MRas are red pillers or in otehr words red pillers like mras more than mras like red pillers (and red piller out number mras). Red pillers see MRas as dupes and hopelessly naive cucks. MRas see red pillers as supporting a toxic system and as kind scummy people.

"A few years ago, if I would have heard of this... thing... I might have considered myself one of them. This is because I considered myself to be celibate or a virgin because of involuntary circumstances. It dawned on me at some point that this idea, of being nice and it, sex, was owed, was not of women, but of an object which intercourse would happen. Sex is more than genitals touching. I'm nearing 25, and I still have not had sex; I've had chances, but then nonconsensual sex isn't sex. I have, with consent, had a girl at my apartment and we slept in the same bed together. We didn't ""sleep together"" ""have sex"" but shared each other. Going forward, for me, that is more important than losing this mythical object called virginity.",15,4,2018-08-17T17:13:20.000Z

"I used to listen to a lot of the Tom Leykis show in my early 20s, and took his perspective pretty seriously. Back in the day I never knew much about incel 'philosophy' until now, but a lot of it really rang familiar, and I never realized it until now; Women can't be your friends, women aren't worth your time except as a 'cum dumpster', ugly women are less than human, etc... It's frightening to think that I could have ended up that way if I hadn't made friends with a handful of women who helped to turn my perspective around. That kind of thought is dangerous and frightening, and it's no wonder that some young, depressed, angry men who feel like sex is the end-all, be- all of existence, the only way to earn validation as a human being, feel left behind by society, and act out in ways that get others hurt or killed.

"Nah dating apps were way better before I transitioned and admitted I was attracted to men. It was easy to find women and have deep and interesting conversations that lead to dates which lead to dating, now I‚Äôve seen such a large sample size of dicks that I‚Äôm basically a dickologist and I‚Äôve been exposed to the depraved extreme depths of masculine sexuality. But worst of all is the endless procession of dullness that they come out with. Which is not actually their fault, it‚Äôs what society and patriarchy have created and the apps reinforce. For me courtship in all forms is just boring, I don‚Äôt want to pursue or be pursued I want to have meaningful social relationships and for romance to spring from that. The sexist thing in the world is the sudden realisations two people share that leads to intimacy. The realisation that you could fuck, the realisation of romance, the realisation of love. Not the inherent dishonesty and weirdness of the chase. But the thing is that none of us need sex or romance. What we need is love and intimacy but that comes in many forms which are not romantic or sexual, but sadly our social consensus is that sex and romance are required in order to experience this.",0,0,2018-08-17T08:28:35.000Z

"Let's not also leave out the gymcel, essentially the /fit/ (4chan's fitness board) version. I find that one particularly interesting since it's a group dedicated to improving their body composition, and accordingly physical attractiveness. Yet, they still have a similar mindset, often thinking it doesn't matter how good their bodies get, that they will still be doomed to their incel status.

Anyway, I've been noticing a LOT of people making videos about incels recently, from youtube bloggers to Vice to even television news organizations. I find it odd that there's so much about them all at once, like they're the hot new topic. Was this video really meant more as a response to this recent focus from all these different places, and you want to use this as a sort of ""set the record straight"" type of video essay, or was this a matter more of reacting to the same things those other groups were, but yours just took a bit longer to come out due to production?

Either way, this is a great video on the topic, and I think you might just help to crack through some shells with it. At least I hope so. It's tough to see these guys do this to themselves. I know I've had thoughts not entirely unlike some of the ones self-professed incels tend to have (although I've never let myself get to the point of straight-up misogyny) and it can be one hell of a brutal downward spiral. Especially if there isn't someone who get can get through to them. Which is VERY hard, due to the way they arrange the barriers that you mention in the video.

But yes, excellent video. But even more importantly than all that other stuff I said: The lighting on this one is SUPER top-notch! Keep stepping that light and color game up.",16,2,2018-08-17T06:46:56.000Z

"I'd never heard of TTTT before.  I'm glad I never did.  Though it does remind me of how I quit my morbid curiosity with Drunken Peasants after discovering Natalie's channel and channels like it.  I didn't like what it was doing to me, and holy fuck, their blatant misogyny and gaslighting about it (not to mention the half-in / half-out transphobia and bigotry of all sorts.)",0,1,2018-08-17T06:34:09.000Z

"I was so hoping you'd do something about incels. Your skill of rooting g out bullshit while also being compassionate to the seed of genuine pain that lays in the center of this thought process. Very well done. But if I may add to the discourse: people of any gender and orientation can be incels. I believe in the very core of this phenomenon is an intense self loathing centered on their percieved physical  unattractiveness. They aren't pretty enough, so no one could ever love them. Our society is obsessed with appearance and hosts indistry that makes billions of dollars be selling people on the idea that beauty is everything and they would t ever be beautiful without them. All genders are swamped with images and messages that tell them how they will never be good enough. Incels are what happens when this advertising is internalized and exaggerated by social anxiety and lack of any opposing experiences.",113,8,2018-08-17T06:14:58.000Z

"I think this is one of my favs :) The comparison to the trans online culture and the how it was made personally relatable was great. It made the video seem like an analysis of these incels as people and not anomalies that are completely unlike us. Not that pandering to misogynists is a massive virtue, but the ability of the video to maybe change a mind or two was great.",105,0,2018-08-17T06:01:43.000Z
