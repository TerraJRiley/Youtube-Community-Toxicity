"Seriously, I have many experiences on dating apps for lesbian and one thing I have just realized from this video is that even English native speakers could have problems with texting. It is so hard to create such a text that is not plain and boring but, interesting and smart. Also you have to make sure it is an universal joke if it suppose to be funny because none of these people will ask you to clarify anything. I'm pretty sure I'm interesting enough as a person and a decent date but to convince a stranger to believe that through every single sentence shows how crule a modern love works now. Somehow, this is less likely happen in the gay men world. They have much more high chance to get pass this step to see each other in real life. ... What happen to all of us gay girls?

doesn’t she have a girlfriend?,12,0,2018-04-10T20:02:38.000Z
"I dunno, I find that lasting relationships (At least that I've seen) start with friendship and progress naturally into something sexual/romantic. I think when people get upset about not being able to find the right person, it's due to putting pressure on things too quickly. Finding a girlfriend online is totally helpful especially if you're introverted or live in a small town but, as far as dating apps, I can't see how they'd be too helpful in finding something lasting. 

Not to say there isn't exceptions to both scenarios ofc",22,4,2018-04-10T19:53:03.000Z
"the problem is that I found out that I'm biromantic just a year ago and I do know how to talk to boys, but since boys are really getting on my nerves,  I tried to talk to girls and I dONT KNOW HOW. I do have many female friends but Idk how to interact to girls romantically : it's like i'm at the start of puberty again lmao",198,11,2018-04-10T19:38:16.000Z
