"Spelling does take a lot of concentration. I doubt spelling goes into implicit memory like other things do, so trying to spell why doing other shit is harder than multitasking with other stuff. BTW, multitasking doesn't exist, our brains can *only* focus on doing one thing at a time. The only exception to this is when things go into your implicit memory. So, drumming, for example, can easily be done only when your coordinated hand and feet movements are put into implicit memory. That's why nobody can be an instant prodigy at drumming or other things like it. You'd *have* to have taught yourself to coordinate your hand and feet movements, somehow, before being good at drumming.",0,0,2018-03-29T06:04:54.000Z

I've heard this is supposed to be the easiest one, but I don't know what you're SUPPOSED to do or if there's a fancy way of fighting it (like the lightning pillars against Thunderblight Ganon).

It was like having my friends around again laughing, playing video games and ribbing on each other relentlessly. It gave me the strength and motivation to beat the cancer and make my own channel!
