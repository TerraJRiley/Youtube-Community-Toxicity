"I must say, after watching a few videos of almost scarily angry people shrieking about how awful Star Wars 8 was is, it's really refreshing to see a real measured criticism, even when you believe that this might actually harm somebody.

"I think your point that by trying to make the audience sympathetic to what is pretty much a purple, controlling, violent, manipulative, self important serial killer the movie inadvertently ends up framing Thanos's abuses as understandable, excusable, or even desirable. These kinds of narratives are tricky to pull off because people don't really understand mental illness. They think dangerous people like narcissists and sociopaths and tyrants THINK like they would, like a normal person would and project that onto them. So when you write them to make them ""sympathetic"", you write from your experiences, you make them seem normal, ""human"" rather then what they are. Broken. Missing something important. An half baked human. Thankfully, the subject matter is so dark that I think despite that, most people come away going from the movie, Thanos is messed up.",0,0,2018-09-22T22:23:35.000Z

"I am 100% on board with your reading of Thanos and his relationship to Gomorrah,  but I will defend Peter Quill. I WILL defend Peter Quill for one moment: Thanos forces Peter to put a gun to Gomorrah's head and pull the trigger, forced him to go through the entire emotional process of personally killing the woman he has feelings for, only to fake him out with the  reality stone. And then after Gomorrah is kidnapped by Thanos and Peter finds out that Thanos forced him to pull the trigger only to fake him out JUST SO HE COULD TAKE HER AWAY AND KILL HER HIMSELF LATER was an entirely believable emotional moment. Your other critiques of Quill being an insunfferable manchild and can only properly be handled in the hands of Gunn himself are still spot on, but that moment where he blows everything because he found out Thanos Killed Gamorrah was IMO nailed.",0,0,2018-09-22T06:36:45.000Z

"I can't say exactly what got to me about this movie, but your point towards the end probably hits close to it. They seem to put the stakes too high, so high that's it's... unreal? Marvel still has a lot to go from here, if anything this would fit more as a finale of the whole marvel series. It just seems that marvel got impatient and wanted to film a Thanos arc, you know? It feels like a side story at this point. Noncanon for the sake of plenty of action and seeing your favorite characters together. Spiderman for example just got his own movie, one where it hints that he has a lot to grow from, and at this early stage of his growth in a hero, he has to deal with quite possibly the biggest threat he'd ever have to deal with. And then he just up and dies at the end, for what? He's obviously coming back and all, but it all just seems meaningless. It's hard to see this as a progressive movie for the marvel heroes here. It just all seems like a fun film made to entertain us with a fun watch. Plot wise, it just feels all meaningless.

"I like your videos but I have to disagree with your point about the writing around the 15:45 mark.  I don't think it's bad writing because plans like this happened in real life.  If you substitute Thanos with Hitler, it's pretty much the same plan.  Somebody with a resolve to fix a problem ""as they see it"" by deleting/murdering/eliminating a sizeable portion of the population.  Their plan is horrific, ludicrous and extreme by normal peoples standards.  The fact that the plan is bad is not the point of this movie in my opinion.  Any plan that includes Genocide is not a good plan.  However, it also doesn't mean that the villain doesn't have some levels of success either.  Take this movie and overlay the Nazi timeline of their rise to power up through the time they invaded and occupied several parts of Europe and you have this movie in some aspects.  We just haven't gotten to the part where Axis/Thanos loses and the Allies/Avengers wins.",0,0,2018-09-20T21:48:29.000Z
"I didn't get the ""abuse=love"" vibe at all. The fact that Thanos loves Gamora and the fact that he is an abusive figure(person? god? entity? Titan?) are completely independent aspects of the character. Love is a set of chemical reactions in the brain that produce a certain set of feelings, what each person does with or because of those feelings is completely dependent on their personality, so evil people will express love in evil ways, misguided people will express love in misguided ways and good, healthy, stable people will express love in good, healthy and stable ways. I think having a character that expresses love through abuse being known as ""The Mad Titan"" quite clearly sends the message that it is not endorsing his behaviour or his beliefs. Every character in the movie that is not one of Thanos's zealots openly disagrees with both his goals and his methods. He might be the protagonist of the movie but he is still the villain in the overall story that all the MCU movies have built towards.",0,0,2018-09-20T05:09:21.000Z

"I do agree with you generally. ""Blizzard cutscene"" lady - nailed it. Peter Quill's reduction to his simplistic past immaturity level is one of my top complaints about it. I was thinking as I watched that too many defeats happened for the life of a single person which was crazy given the stakes of that loss, and his case was the worst by a long way. Even Quill would be too mature to risk the universe over one person. It was his plan! And yeah, we didn't really know much about Thanos' henchbeasts. 

And yet, I really enjoyed the film. I accept a change in tone for the Guardians because they were no longer being presented on their own terms and the stakes were higher. I am a ghoul and lapped up the reaction of Spiderman to being cornflaked and I love Spiderman so I'm a monster I suppose. But like a lot of others here, I have seen enough abusive relationships to see how weirdly attached the abuser and victim seem to be. A neglected child pretty easily walks away without any connection but a child who was systemically conditioned to bow and scrape and try to earn the love of a charismatic abuser who sculpts his cruelty into the shape of affection for years... Someone like that might manage to break free but that kind of conditioning stays with you. Hell, I was picked on steadily for just part of my life in public school and have never been completely free of the effects. What she endured went even deeper.

And I never really got the feeling they fully surrendered to the idea of Thanos' behavior amounting to love. Gamora made amends with Nebula in GotG2 and here was Thanos torturing one sister and showing the other. Gamora was frankly shocked that he apparently loved her and never really accepted it because he was using it to justify her murder. He is a murderer and his love doesn't count as such.

Finally, I kinda think the scenario is something a lot of Americans really feel right now. The parallels are staggering. You have an unquestionable villain hell-bent on dragging everyone through his agenda, and against all expectation, the villain wins. So if they undo everything, honestly, we'll probably applaud and hope for the same.",0,0,2018-09-19T04:35:18.000Z
"8:00 ""It's not justified from a film-making perspective.  I'm not talking about the plot, I'm talking about the people who made the decision to do this.  You actually do have responsibilities.""

Responsibilities to avoid dealing with real topics that make us uncomfortable?  Bullshit.  Responsibilities to only present ideas we agree with when touching on difficult themes?  Bullshit.

8:18 ""How many young children will watch this part of the movie sitting in a theater right next to an authority figure who abuses them?  The message that that child will receive is:  Abuse is Love.""

If that's true, then the appropriate response to the message is:  Fuck love.  Which is a place a real person might have to go in dealing with abuse from a loved one.  That's the bitter truth, and I'm sorry if you can't seem to handle that, but I feel like I have to call this out because you just spent half an hour of my time talking about how Marvel was irresponsible in its handling of the theme of Abuse, but here you are seemingly in denial about the real complexity of the issue.  Abusers are human, and sometimes they do really love the people they abuse.  If we can't acknowledge that and yet extricate our understanding of Abuse from our sense of Love despite it, what hope do we who were abused have of ultimately realizing healthy Love?  It's not supposed to be comfortable or simple - THAT would have been irresponsible, to show abusive parents as black-and-white monsters with no redeemable humanity.

13:30 ""Our inability to have an honest conversation about mental health in this country, while simultaneously pumping out entertainment that just invents whatever definitions for mental health it wants to because it suits their story...  and that's pretty crappy.""

It is crappy!  Right!  We should have an honest conversation about mental health in our entertainment.  More to the point, we should have a factually accurate conversation about mental health in America.  Absolutely no disagreement from me on that one.

And you're right, it's not an Infinity War problem, but it's not just a comics problem either.  It's pretty pandemic to all forms of fiction and all genres since ever.  But now I feel like I'm splitting hairs.  You made a good point here, and I appreciate it.

17:00  ""Which sucks a little bit, because now you've wielded some very real trauma for a cheap theatric.""

No, they wielded theatrical trauma for theatrics.  Nebula's suffering isn't real.  Infinity War isn't real.  It's a movie.  A work of fiction.  We, the audience, are expected to maintain a mental partition between the events on the screen and real life.  From the way you talk about this movie, it seems like you were unable to do that, and brother, that ain't on Marvel.  Sorry, man.  But you talk about this film being ""irresponsible"" as if they really tortured real human beings to make it.

Artists have to be allowed to challenge our values and preconceptions in order to fulfill their job in our society.  That's simply more important that ensuring the audience is comfortable all the time.",0,0,2018-09-18T10:44:44.000Z
"I agree with some of your points here. The fact that this movie is a misery factory and will alienate younger audiences? Absolutely. I've never felt anything at the end of a theater experience like I did watching this film. Almost utter silence, broken only by children crying. The theater was just HEAVY.

Things I don't agree about:

The Gamora/Thanos relationship. My interpretation wasn't that abuse is love, but that you can legitimately love someone and still hurt them. That just because someone loves you doesn't mean they're justified in what they do to you. On top of which, I have the inkling that the next Avengers is going to be a rebuttal of a lot of what Thanos is about, thematically as well as physically.

Also, everyone takes the math angle with Thanos's solution. If he just meant to reduce the population mathematically with the least possible suffering, he'd have the survivors forget the dusted ever existed. But that doesn't appear to be the case. No, I don't think it's just about having less people.

I think it's about the Black Death. The way that the sudden dip in population and the new excess in resources led to a period of unprecedented societal growth. The Renaissance couldn't have happened without the Black Death. 

I also think it's a ""The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas"" situation. That, knowing the cost of what they have, the survivors will cherish each other and their resources. They'll feel obligated to be kinder, wiser people.

I think that he's wrong, still. After all, the Renaissance was temporary, and we've had  world wars since then. It's still a temporary solution. As long as the world--the universe, in the case of the MCU--is working from a framework of scarcity and inequality, there's going to be conflict. And we already know that someone on the other side of the world is going without for the sake of our plenty, and that doesn't stop us from squandering what we have or being greedy for more. 

But I feel he's wrong for different, or additional reasons, than everyone points out.",0,0,2018-09-18T09:20:08.000Z

"Really respect your opinion, and this was a good show. Some points I agree on - notably that althought Thanos is fantasticically acted, and in the minutia exceptionally well written, his over all motivation is utterly bonkers. And not 'lol i r insane' bonkers, I mean it's the sort of insanity that's like hitting your head with a fish. IF he really wanted to stop overpopulation of the universe, then surely the answer would be some form of contraception? Not saying that it also doesn't have moral issues, but it makes more sense than anything else. Still, I suppose Avengers: Contraception Wars didn't really have the right ring to it. 

I... do see where you're coming with from the torture/suffering point. It didn't massivly bother me... but I do see where your'e coming from. I'd hope that the next one will be considerably more up beat. I am certainly very curious to see where they go with it. I have a feeling that aspect may well just come down to 'personal taste' and I'm not sure it's anything that can be... changed? I wonder if this level of darkness was, in a way, unavoidable. 

The aspect I do dissagree with, (and many of the commenters here do) is reguarding the abuse/love aspect of Gamora and Thanos. 
It reminds me strongly of another film - featuring a young boy who's stolen away by a kidnapper. The young boy, once intended to be sold to a man who would surely kill him, is instead forced to work for the kidnapper's gang. Forced into a life of piracy and thievery, threatened with horrible death multiple times, he eventually grows up to be a young rebel who flees his kidnapper. Tracked across long distances, it is only due to immence bravery, plucky friends, and a quick bit of thinking that he manages to fully escape, earning the grudging respect of his kidnapper dispite it all. But even this little bit of softness from the pirate kidnapper looses the respect of his crew. He nearly looses it all, but to a small extent redeems himself later on, fighting a powerful enemy by the side of the man who was once the boy he kidnapped and enslaved. He dies in this fight and the man sits there, weeping about how his abusive kidnapper was in fact a better father to him than his biological one.
That (or those films) is the Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2. The charcters Peter Quill and Yondu. 
Granted it's nothing quite on the scale of Thanos, (we don't see much in the way of physical abuse from Yondu, for example, but I can certainly believe he or his crew would have and did) but the difference isn't huge. Yet at the end of that, Peter weeps over the body of a man who, at the very least mentally, did abuse him. Love/relationships are complex things. This doesn't of course by any means excuse or justify abuse, but it isn't black and white either. Gamora's 'love' of Thanos is never shown as a 'good' thing particularly, excepting that, in the face of all the horror she has been through, she is still capable of love. Thanos's love of Gamora is shown as a good thing in a way - but not anything that excuses his actions. It humanaizes him a little yes, it makes him more relatable (I think perhaps that's a better word than sympathetic) but it doesn't make him a good person. 
Love doesn't justify abuse. Abuse isn't a sign of love. But it is possible for the two to coexist, complicated and often sadening as it may be.",0,0,2018-09-17T23:56:25.000Z

"I'm glad I went to the comments. I think most of the people down here bring up points more valid than yours.. 

Now rant time: 

You readily accept that children are stupid enough to not recognize Thanos to be a villain - when possibly children with abusive parents will recognize EVEN MORE CLEARLY then the rest of us how despicable he is, and you don't even stop to consider that Marvel's setting him up to knock him down.

Also, what a low jab with the ""half the population of the universe"" amounts to nothing. 
Your math is wrong. There are millions or thousands of insects per person, not to mention all the other animals. Humanity is for the sake of the story not wiped out, but it might as well be, as we don't make up anything near 50% of the population of the planet in numbers.
And they clearly say ""half"" the universe, because most other values would be unnecessary specific. 
""Uhm actually, I'm wiping out 50.411% divided evenly among all species, over a time periods of 30 minutes, taking into account that every pregnant being counts for two, that every odd number species will lose an additional member, while the even numbered species will not.""

"Thanos isn't a complex, empathetic and compelling villian because he is correct. He is a complex, empathetic and compelling villian with high stakes because of his resolve. As Josh Brolin said in the clip you presented ""he believes what he is doing is a very positive thing."" The film portrays him as evil and abusive and incapable of love or compassion, and then we find out that despite his abusive attitude to his daughter, he in fact loves her, in his own sick logic he believes the abuse he did to Gamora was his way of ""saving her."" And just when it seems we understand him, he cares about his plan more, he sacrifices Gamora for the plan. His resolve was too important. He attempts to convince Strange to hand over the time stone, he pushes Quill to his limit to prove that he has the will to do what must be done and after Quill proves that he comments that he likes him, he gets frustrated when Gamora doesn't see his side of the argument as Thanos probably just thinks he couldn't explain it well enough, and after Stark puts up a better fight than the Hulk Thanos tells him he has great respect for him but still goes to kill him because Stark is in the way and then spares his life after Strange gives him the stone. It's these traits that makes him such a great villian, his unending resolve and willingness at anything to achieve his goal, not his plan or mental state.",3,0,2018-09-17T17:06:58.000Z
"I guess I was prepared to hulk up and defend the movie, until about 5:46, here I'll just quote it:  ""...Which I'll admit I had a pretty tough 2017, and that amount of trauma was tough for me to deal with in the theater.  I kept pretending to go to the bathroom.  The film made me feel bad, and reminded me of a lot of real world stuff that was uncomfortable.  And I'm not alone on that one.""  Right.  I guess I'm not exactly prepared to argue against that.  And anyway, this video is pretty fair to Infinity War.  I find a lot here to agree with even if I still liked the film in question.

Does Marvel exhibit torture as a circus act, as Mikey puts it?

Here's my take:  Marvel films, and Marvel comics, take themselves a bit more seriously than a circus act.  Putting aside commentary about the ""purpose"" of art or literature in general - or whatever criticism about preaching through fiction - Marvel comics are an extended allegorical exploration of modern history; but aimed at an audience almost entirely comprised of introverted, cerebral teenage boys.  Peter Parker is a _____.  Tony Stark is just a bit more abstracted metaphor for the same thing.  Steve Rogers starts out a kid who gets bullied all the time.  Thor is a rich European kid with daddy issues slumming it in Midgard with the rest of us.  Bruce Banner is soft-spoken nerd with a bad temper.  Dr. Strange is just a really smart kid who tumbles down the rabbit hole of fantasy fandom when he discovers Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter or Game of Thrones.  The catch, the thing that defines Marvel stories, is that at some point in their origins, these characters are forced to outgrow their boyish adventures and accept something like adulthood.  Great power, great responsibility.

Well, that's phase one.  Thanos is phase Adolf Hitler, or whatever other real world Mad Titan we wish to insert into the device.   The unrelentingly dire tone of Infinity War is derived from the real-world phenomenon of genocidal megalomaniac demagogues rising to power one way or another and acting out their final solutions no matter how hard the rational, responsible, civilized adult world tries to stop it from happening.  It's a real thing, not some flippant sideshow invention.  Part of being a self-realized adult in this world is the understanding that this kind of thing can, did, and will come to pass.  Our present science concerning mental illness notwithstanding, real people do shit like this for reasons most can't begin to comprehend.

And if Thanos is painted as ""complex"" or sympathetic, well, yeah, the people who commit genocide are human.  Hitler thought he was doing what needed to be done.  Hitler loved and was married to a young woman who loved him back and who thought the world had simply misunderstood her poor, visionary Adolph.

I know, it's not very Disney to admit that to love and be loved does not automatically render us ""good.""

I get it.  Infinity War is not the light adventure you're used to, it's not what you've come to expect from the franchise.

Infinity War caught a lot of people unprepared.  Like Mikey says, it made our friends feel bad.  If that ruined it for you, I have no substantive counterargument, except maybe:  All the Marvel stories have something to do with trauma.  Iron Man is not actually about Tony Stark escaping an uncomfortable place so he can come home and eat Burger King.  Spider-Man is not an otherwise happy kid just trying to ride the bus.  If that's all Marvel was, it wouldn't be ""for everybody.""  As Rocket says in Guardians of the Galaxy, ""I don't care if it's mean:  Everybody's got dead people.""  Everybody's got trauma.  Look around you.  We all had a tough 2017, Mikey.  The world desperately needs a way to work through some pretty unrelentingly dire shit sometimes.

"I agree with you on Thanos plot being thin and the abuse part. I expected a plot twist there because I didn't believe it was actually love either.

I personally believe it would be awesome if Thanos amassed all that power so that he could fix what he believes wrong with the universe by ruling it like an intergalactic emperor. Bump up his resume by showing the worlds he ruled and made better to make him complex. Giving a reason to why he has followers at all. He could have great ideas on how to fix the universe by actually doing the hard work. He is disciplined, obviously smart and competent. He could have essentially be shown as a well-meaning tyrant instead of a madman who just wants to kill.

Avengers would still go up against him on account of personal beliefs and Earth's liberty and once they defeat him and back him into a corner, then he could have used the snap as a last resort, out of desperation.

"There's a lot wrong with this video. For starters, a critical error that you (and a lot of people) make is that Thanos is the protag which simply isn't the case. He's just another antagonist, and him being a well written and complex character with his own belief system doesn't change that. Darth Vader was never the protagonist of Empire, and he still won in that movie. In the end, Thanos is still a villain that our heroes must overcome. Speaking of heroes...

The film was a bit of a clusterf**k with all of the different heroes, but it's clear that Tony Stark and Thor are the two main heroes that the audience should be rooting for, especially Tony.

Another big issue is with the GotG, specifically Starlord. His character and his relationship with the other guardians is perfectly normal given the events of the first two movies. I really don't understand what you mean by Starlord being a man child. If you mean that he's witty and occasionally cracks jokes, even in dire circumstances, that doesn't make any sense. The GotG movies have always been this way, and it makes sense, especially given that they're a dysfunctional family. If you're talking about his dialogue with Tony Stark on Titan, that doesn't make any sense either. Both Peter and Tony have been the alpha characters of their own movies, and it makes a lot of sense that they would interact and conflict in such a way. If you're talking about how he lashes out against Thanos and ruins everything, that's also completely nonsensical. We've seen him act like this in Volume 2, and he's never learned not to lash out like that. He hasn't went through the same character growth as let's say Tony to hold himself back. It makes me wonder if you've even watched these movies.

Finally I want to cover the alleged ""abuse = love"" stuff, which is total bollocks. Thanos is, as I've already explained, the villain. Although he is a complex character who believes that he is on the right side of history, he's still the villain, he's still the Mad Titan. It seems that you were well aware of this and simply shrugged it off because it didn't suit your narrative, which really irks me. Thanos did truly love Gamora, and he truly believed that he was doing the right thing, but he was still crazy, which is why we have this abusive relationship and why he's in the pursuit of mass murdering half of all life. This stems back to your point about Thanos as the protagonist, if you were to recognize that he was the villain of Infinity War, then this normalization of abusive relationships thing that you're preaching simply wouldn't hold any water.

I was never any good at making a conclusion or closing statement, but please don't take this as me having any ill will towards you. I only wanted to point out the errors in your arguments, because let's be real for a second, the arguments presented in this video weren't all that good.

"I've greatly enjoyed many of your videos, but this one was borderline pitiful. What I gathered from watching this was that you and your friends were personally triggered by the dark events of Infinity War (as you SHOULD be) and decided that was enough to make a poorly justified argument that somehow Marvel is never allowed to make great movies that surpass the genre (or in this case, the comic's movie universe) expectations or precedents. Infinity War is among the greatest films ever made, I'm glad to have been alive to witness this BECAUSE it took us all by such surprise. Your statement ""Marvel films are for everyone"" and applying that to why Infinity War is not allowed to be traumatic, is about as childish and simple minded as saying ""Star Wars is for everyone"" after A New Hope, and then using that to deride Empire Strikes Back for its darker thematic leaps (and now it is widely accepted as the best film in the series). 

You also seem to have no idea what it's like being in any sort of abusive relationship, which is okay, but then you use that ignorance to support your misinformed ideology to shit on one of the best villains in movie history. Don't you get it? Thanos is real mate. Have you not looked around you in 2018? Have you never seen or met a person like him? They exist, and they are more common than you think. The empathy for him comes in that we have seen Thanos, we have  dealt with Thanos, and so we have come to understand him because the world is a complicated place with complicated people. I don't have to agree with his actions to be blown away by him and his motivations. You're free to feel uncomfortable about him, but then don't make such a superficial video essay for 20 minutes. Come on dude, you're better than that. You've got to bring more to the table than, ""I'm personally offended by a movie villain."" As we all were dude. You keep saying you don't want to take away anyone's enjoyment of this film, but really, I think that's exactly what you're trying to accomplish. I felt uncomfortable watching your video specifically because I felt as though you were calling ME and anyone else who loves this movie despicable for doing so. Even though you are the one who does not understand abusive relationships or what it's like to have crazy parents who traumatized you. 

So good for you, I'm glad you were never put in a position in your life where you would have experienced something like Gamora and Thanos. But please, do not then speak to the effect it has on the rest of us. Many of us know exactly what that's like, so do not take away from the Russo brothers or Marvel for having the balls to portray something so difficult so well onscreen. 

I'm still a fan of yours, and I'll remain subscribed to you. Your vid on The Last Jedi is one of my favs. But please, and I mean this in a respectful way, grow up and do your research next time. You cannot speak on such difficult subject matter from a weak subjective viewpoint. You should have put this vid on the back burner for a few months and let it settle in your mind.

"I don't think Mikey knows about Munchausen by proxy. It's an extreme and very real form of abuse from parents to children, often eventually leading to murder of the child. Yet, in the parents' warped and damaged mind, they are trying to be caring and loving. People with this affliction notoriously describe how much they love their children, despite their atrocities.

"Hello Mikey! Overall, I really appreciate your voice on this platform but I have a disagreement with you here. You summarize Thanos as a ""man who doesn't listen to logic or reason"". I think this completely misses the point. It would be more accurate to say that Thanos ONLY listens to logic and reason--he represents pure reason removed from any emotional engagement, and that's the whole reason why he makes us feel uncomfortable. It's impossible for us humans to interact with the world through that lens. We're captives to our emotional biases when it comes to decision making. So the theme of Thanos is the conflict between reason and emotion. In fact, his plan is never given a compelling counter-argument, only a depiction of humanity's emotional instinct that it feels wrong. And that's enough for us. Now, I'm not trying to make an argument for the value of this movie, it was fine. As you said, it was more of an event than a piece of narrative. I just think your interpretation of the text here is a little off. (and as far as Thanos's plan being 'bad', I never got the idea that it was supposed to be a one-and-done solution, more of a pruning of the tree, so to speak. So I think that particular plot contrivance complaint doesn't really hold up.)

 I also take a little issue with the phrase 'manufactured stakes'. It's kinda like Drax saying to Thor, ""That's a made-up word."" All words are made up, and all stakes in narrative fiction are manufactured.",0,0,2018-09-15T19:17:32.000Z

"Almost entirely Thanos is depicted as a malignant narcissist in this movie. He enjoys violence, he treats those close to him as possessions, has a massively inflated idea of his own importance is glib and has a brutal charisma that people can be drawn to. So it's believable that Gamora would have these complex emotions regarding him. Thanos though could not therefore know or understand or feel true love and complex emotions, at least not in the way the way we understand them. So the main thing that has confused me is; how on earth did he get the Soul Stone? Until we see the next movie that's the major flaw/question for me.",0,0,2018-09-15T18:01:17.000Z
"I think you're thing about Thanos and his sacrifice of Gamora is missing a main point. Which is that The soul stone said to sacrifice something an individual loved, which doesn't mean the love had to be healthy/true love, it just had to be someone you felt that you loved and Thanos felt he loved her. But in the film as in real life, just as in real life, just cause someone loves someone else doesn't mean it's healthy. If one were in an abusive relationship One might say that they only hurt their loved one cause they care about them. Or look at someone like Hitler, he probably loved Germany to an extreme degree, but that still doesn't justify what he did. And I doubt kids will leave the theatre thinking what Thanos does is okay just cause he loved Gamora. I think that kind of makes it seem like kids can't understand a healthy relationship vs an unhealthy one. I think kids are smart enough to see that. Especially since Thanos is the Villain, meaning you're not suppose to try to do what he did, you're suppose to avoid doing what Thanos does. Kids don't watch Lion King and then kill their siblings out of jealousy like Scar did. Or even take Batman TAS where they explore abusive relationships with Joker and Harley. Those two would never admit what they have is unhealthy, but the kids watching this kid's show are wise enough to see what's going on. I know at the end of the day you're gonna have your opinions and that's fine but I just think people will get that what Thanos is doing is wrong, especially kids.

"I understand you have your point of you and that’s cool (you do you) but when the main protagonist’s name is Thanos, the mad titan and you try to use true logic In the character’s motives then you fail. When you say the stakes are arbitrarily high after they spent most movies since avengers 1 pointing out that this  guy that’s been behind everything all the big infinity stone issues and the stones are defined in universe level terms in multiple movies then no they did not artificially increase the threat level. Even in avengers 2, Thor points out when Thor leaves that someone dangerous is playing a dangerous game with so many stones appearing. And the not so subtle foreshadowing is that all li.  Is threatened. So this has been set up.

When you say so many story points don’t work I wonder who told you they don’t. Dr Strange and Ironman both have similar personalities but we see a lot of differences between them owed to their different world views and experiences. They used things like color pallet to differentiate groups and the interplay of characters was fresh and interesting. This is all working on all cylinders,

Then your take on what you think of as love = torture reminds me of the way it was framed in the 80’s.  Ack in the days of the Satanic panic. Then, when the villain did something and the Moral Majorly wanted to claim that it was the film makers addenda - when the opposite is more true. They are the villain and are meant to be opposed and defeated (remember this has always been part 1 of a two movie package so you can guess where this will lead)

I don’t buy your take and while this is a dark film (filled with tragic events) it is for everyone and works for everyone I know. No one leaves it happy- and that is the point. It is a tragedy and a guy punch setting up a second movie.  Marvel knows the formula and shows they are willing to subvert their own generally happy ending style if the story needs it. Good job to them and they honesty hit every beat right along the way (nitpicks aside). It was not the amount the movie made that made it a good movie for me. It was not the number of quotes. It was not the spectacle or FX that made it perfect. This movie had heart and a good story. I feel you are is so MANY ways wrong and not getting it.

Second, I think you lost the point of the matter, everything is wrong everything he did and what he sees as love is really obsession, if someone sees him doing all these things, he must understand that it is wrong and that is why the avengers fight so that their ideals are not fulfilled.

He still has anger issues especially around the people he loves being harmed. He learns his real dad was never his biological father and his family is now the guardians in the second movie. He doesn't learn how to control his emotions, he never does that in that movie. And then, when faced with a similar point that Tony Stark faced in Civil War, coming face to face with the person who he JUST learned killed his loved one, Tony steps in and tries to calm him down from making the same mistake he made but Quill acts just like Tony, just like a guy who had gone through 3 individual movies worth of growth, 2 avengers movies, and an entire Captain America movie. THAT guy reacts like Quill who has had 2 full movies and then Infinity War. His anger and reaction isn't going backward, it's right where he is as a character.

He isn't insane and he's definitely not a hero, and I don't think the intention of the film was to make him seem so. He's fully in control of the choices he makes and understands the consequences. However, he's incredibly delusional in his method. If the movie was really trying to portray Thanos as doing the right thing, he could just have easily gathered the infinity stones, snapped his fingers and doubled the resources on every planet.

Quill doesn't attack Thanos, someone would say that's inconsistent with his core character, probably you, to get the controversy views. Can someone please pinpoint the moment when Quill realized that losing his temper and attacking his dad was a ""mistake""? When he started regretting his actions? Right, because it didn't happen and he never did. We as an audience may have thought it was a dumb move and thought of a hundred ways he could have gotten the upper hand by keeping his cool. But at no point do we see him blaming his temper for what happened to Yondu or showing any regret for standing up to his father then and there. Character development doesn't mean completely inverting whatever aspect of a person's character you're talking about. ""Oh, this person has learned that losing his temper is really, really bad so he's never ever ever going to losing his temper ever again."" In that case, the person might have learned to control their temper BETTER, but will probably lose their temper in an extremely stressful situation.

I'm sorry the movie made your friends cry, but the movie didn't make light of their abuse (if they were abused, i'm just assuming here) just because it showed a complex and abusive relationship. There are plenty of movies that have similar plots or subplots  of adult children dealing with their abusive parent and having a wide range of complex emotions.

I know these are comic book movies and a lot of children go and watch them, but to dictate a genre can't tackle certain topics is beyond presumptuous.

"Thanos' entire ideology is basically a right-wing authoritarian's wet dream. That's why several youtube channels picked up on it so easily--it's a very possible solution to what many people see as a very prescient problem (the concept of overpopulation is also right-wing bull anyway because earth's carrying capacity isn't 10 billion it's more like 10 trillion, but overpopulation is easy to get folks scared of).
And on the topic of parental abuse, I know people who have lived and are living in abusive households. They are taught that what their parents are doing to them is ""for the greater good;"" that conditional love is the only way to raise a child. So whenever that child tries to fight for themselves against their parents, who have insured their horrible actions with ""it's for your own good,"" that can lead to that child doubting whether standing up for themselves is the right thing to do, and that's why Gamora cried after stabbing Thanos. You make a good point, Thanos doesn't show unconditional love for either of his stolen daughters (and I think that's where that plot thread should've gone with the Soul Stone), but he shows a form of love in the shape of basic parental responsibility (which isn't enough in my opinion but I guess it's a technicality to give Thanos the soul stone).

"7:45 Just for the record, I want to point out this singular statement, which you try to reinforce as a fact... is just completely incorrect. They aren't doing that. Like, at all. I think this single completely incorrect interpretation, taken as a fact, and extrapolated on, colored a lot of your opinion of the movie.

I just want to state as well, I'm not saying your opinions are wrong. I'm saying that drawing a line in the sand and stating that the writers use Thanos' actions to conflate abuse with love like it's some kind of algebra equation is simply factually incorrect.

You extrapolate on that point to exhaustion so I'm not going to hash it out completely but I do want to bite at the part that genuinely made me angry about this video. You (using your words) ""unequivocally"" state people that are abusive are incapable of loving the people they abuse, and even stray into (less unequivoally) implying they are not really capable of love as most people see it.

That almost makes me vomit.

The vast majority of people that are abusive are not sociopaths. They are people, just regular people, with greater flaws than most, and a lot of research shows, tend to have a lot more scars than most. There are not really many sadists in the world, thankfully. Mostly a lot of people who learned lessons from the wrong people at the wrong time, who have bad coping mechanisms. That doesn't excuse their behavior. You don't need to be sat down when you're a kid yourself and have a parent tell you ""Now if/when you're a parent some day, don't beat your fucking kids."" Shit's kind of intuitive. But violence or manipulation are sometimes just how people are taught to react to certain things.

There is help out there for people like that, sadly often having to be court mandated after shit goes really off the rails. I know that from experience with an abusive Uncle who didn't ""believe"" in therapy until a judge made him believe it and everyone cut all ties with him. Years later my cousins have forgiven him and he's a fond, if distant, part of his kid's and grandkid's lives.

Those Grandkid's only know him as a loving Grandfather. Should he have been erased from everyone's lives permanently for actions many years ago that he not only sought to atone for but did AND got the help for (he is in regular therapy last I heard, his original mandated anger management and community service must have made a believer in him)? Does he really sound like someone incapable of love? Like someone who never loved his kids?

If you think yes... well honestly I don't know why I would even stay subbed to this channel. Trying to find the positive spin in bad movies is laudable, but ironic if you can't see the love and empathy in someone deeply flawed.",3,0,2018-09-10T03:16:44.000Z

"Marvel does make movies for (largely) everyone, but you can't please all of the people all of the time. As you said in the video, your own personal experiences have made you feel this way about the film. The abuse = love stuff didn't turn me off of this film because (luckily) I've never suffered abuse like that. The issue is when Marvel is trying to make a film, virtually everything would be off limits if they worried about every segment of society and how they'd react. For instance in Civil War Tony's parents are found out to be murdered. For audience members who have had their parents murdered, they would probably have a similar reaction that you had to this film. So should they take that scene out? How about people with PTSD seeing Iron Man 3 and Winter Soldier? Or people that have survived horrific car accidents seeing Dr. Strange? The list goes on and on. Unfortunately almost every scene in any film will trigger some people due to their personal experience.

"I respect the heck out of you and your videos Mikey, but I couldn’t disagree more about this movie getting the guardians wrong. When I came out of the theater I was like wow they nailed the guardians in that movie, and then later I found out it was because James gunn wrote all of the guardians dialogue. Yes peter hasn’t completely learned how to not be a man child but I don’t think it erases the previous movies, I think it emphasizes his ongoing character flaw, one that is not easily overcome in a single act of heroism. And especially considering the fact that he was in one of the most stressful traumatizing situations he’s ever been in, it is completely understandable that he lost his cool. Peter quill was completely in character in that moment and I will always defend that.

And Yes this movie was not made for “everyone”, but I don’t think that’s a bad thing. After 20 movies i think infinity war is justified in treating marvel fans like adults who know what’s going on and not having to make everything a family movie. 

Listen I understand your concern for how this movie will affects children. I think that is a legitimate concern. I do agree that in some part Disney does have a responsibility, but on the other hand, they are not the children’s movie company they used to be. Soon, for better or more likely worse, Disney will own a huge chunk of the entertainment industry, and if that entire chunk has to become family friendly, I don’t think that would make sense. This is not a children’s movie for sure, and I think parents should be aware of that, but I don’t think it’s disneys fault if not everything they make is PG. some movies just have to be dark and this movie definitely did.

And I don’t think they’re trying to say that thanos’ abuse was love. I think thanos as a twisted abusive father knows nothing else and so he’s so twisted that he’s willing to sacrifice the only thing he thinks he loves. Gamora was right, he loves no one. But she was, however twisted, the only thing he actually cared about, and so the only part of him that even sort of cared for another person was thrown away. But it was not love, and I don’t think that was the message, even tho it could be misunderstood, and again, children should not be watching this movie anyway.

Mikey I will not quit your channel or videos but in my humble opinion you are distressed because it is not the movie you wanted it to be. 

And, even as much as I don’t like what Peter did it makes sense he would act that way. Peter is all emotion.

"As much as I think of your videos as the standard of movie analysis and insight, I have to tell you that you COMPLETELY missed the point of Thanos. He's not a hero. No child watching this film would look at him and think that his form of ""love"" is characteristic of or indicative of something to be emulated or with which they should identify. This was the retelling of a comic book wherein the norms associated with reasonable or logical behavior DO NOT EXIST. To attempt to selectively apply effeminate sensibilities pertaining to either the personal development or actions depicted throughout the movie is not only silly but CLEARLY an effort on your part to transfer the responsibility for the difficulties you've faced over the past year onto the filmmakers for making you feel bad. They made you feel something. Sad. Uncomfortable. Angry. THAT should be the goal of any artistic endeavor. Your analysis speaks volumes more about your wounded psyche and penchant for transference than it does about Thanos. And show me a single villian plan that makes sense in a movie and I'll concede your point but harping on the LOGIC of his plan just WREAKS of nitpicking and you grasping for a justification to dislike the fact that they upset you. You can;t slob all over John Wick and THEN agonize over the prepoderence of agony and flawed logic of THIS movie.",1,0,2018-09-08T01:13:11.000Z

"Wow, you missed the point of Thanos so complete. He may be the protagonist of this film, but he's also the freakin villain. His abuse of his 'daughters' is a pretty big clue that he's in the wrong. In his mind, he loves them. Tough love, but love, from his point of view. Even if anyone who has ever genuinely cared for another human being is appalled by this. We're not supposed to see Thanos' plan as valid. People have been predicting such starvation because of overpopulation doomsday scenarios since the 1700s. The only places on Earth anything like this happens are in places with dictatorial regimes that oppress basic freedoms. Rather, what we are supposed to see is a man with good intentions, convinced that the saving the universe from itself requires this horrific act. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Evil people through out history don't think of themselves as evil. They think what they're doing is right, even if the rest of us see it for what it truly is.

I think that the Abuse = Love thing they have in this film was never meant to be taken that way. I was sitting in the theatre thinking to myself 'This isn't love. If he loved her, he would have given up the soul stone for her not her for the stone.' I think the love in this film was found in captain america and his speech with Vision about not trading lives, how sacrificing one life to save billions is not okay. I think the contrast between the two views shows how twisted Thanos' view on love is, that he thinks giving someone up for his dreams is love. 

I also think that Thanos is a lunatic. He is crazy but he tries to justify it. We know his view on saving the world is insane so why should we believe his view on love is sane? 

I don't know. This is just my opinion. Please keep making more videos. They are amazing!!!",1,0,2018-09-07T08:46:47.000Z

"Mikey. Thanks for saying a lot of stuff that needed to be said. People seem to think that just because Thanos is the protagonist, everything has to go his way and everything has to at least be right from his point of view, or that the movie is obliged to give him the most generous reading of his charachter possible and then  some. I was BEGGING, FUCKING PRAYING for the scene with the Soul stone and Gamora to end differently. For Thanos to face something other than a bunch of people to punch who he was free to dismiss as opposing viewpoints. In the years where Neo-nazis have truly  mastered the ""two sides to every story"" defense to get moderates to defend them, Thanos represents every piece of that damaged, harmful idea that ""Hey even if he is wrong you have to respect why he feels that way and that his feelings are technically valid"". The soul stone should have refused him. He should have had to make someone else make the sacrifice. There should not have been so many people grieving over sacrifices showing the exact same emotions he did and being treated as equally valid on a universal scale. 

I like the idea of a villian as a protagonist. I don't like the idea that this gives a movie the right to preach a villian's values, to fail to inspire and better peoples lives, or to not give to protagonist some goddamn conflict he can't immediately snap his fingers away at.",0,1,2018-09-07T00:46:56.000Z

"I really love this show. I have always supported your views but this time I cannot agree. I don't usually comment on any videos on Youtube but this one really made me think and consolidate my opinions so here goes:

The film puts forward a dire tone in order to make the audience fearful of Thanos. For 10 years the MCU has been building towards this character and so they want people to understand the stakes of this film. However, I do completely understand your concerns about children seeing this film and being upset. I do agree with your point that the Marvel films are for everyone and I believe that this film did challenge that ideal as it was built upon the notion that we, as an audience, knew who the characters were. So this film was made for the long time fans. Someone who had never seen a Marvel film before, would probably not enjoy this film. This is because they would not know the characters. Someone who has watched all of the films is more likely to enjoy the film as they would not be confused by all the differing characters. This point, I think was shown via the arrival of Steve Rogers in the film which caused a large scale audience reaction as they were aware as to who the character was and had grown with him. 
I do have to completely refute your point that in this film it pushed the idea that absue=love. I do not see this as the message of the film at all. I instead found that this film showed that if you love someone you should not abuse them. This is shown for me by the scene in which Gamora tries to kill Thanos and is affected by this act as she has killed someone who she saw as family. Regardless of the abuse shown by Thanos to her, she still sees him as a father figure. Thanos was shown as an awful parents and thus caused both his children to try and murder him. Also the fact that his cult that followed him around didn't come to Thanos when they failed showed that they are fearful of him. This film showed me that anyone who does abuse you is a poor parental figure as you do not want to compare a parent to Thanos. 
 
I personally liked the way the guardians were handled. I believe that there has been a great deal of backlash towards Peter Quill which is not necessary as his response was expected. In Guardians 1 we are shown how Peter cares for his family, in Guardians 2 we are shown how Peter responds when confronted with the people who hurt his family. In Guardians 2 when Peter finds out that a literal God killed his mum he shoots at the God. That is a dumb idea but Peter is irrational and lashes out when he discovers that Ego killed his mum. In Infinity War, Peter lashes out when he discovers that Thanos killed Gamora. This was an expected response. We see that Peter has not learnt from this that a response of this kind is a bad idea. The only character who we know to have learnt from this is Tony Stark. In Civil War, when Tony discovers that Bucky killed his parents he lashes out without trying to stop the real villain there - Zemo. In Infinity War when Tony realises what is happening he is the first person to say to Quill to calm down and stop. Everyone else focussed on Thanos but Tony knew what was going to happen as he had seen what was going to happen with him back when he fought Bucky and Steve. Quill did exactly what his character would do in that scenario so Peter can now have greater character development, like Stark as he can now know that a response of that kind is a bad move. I also want to challenge your comments on Nebula as we were told that Thanso didn't care for her and we are shown that he didn't like her at all and only really cared for Gamora which is why he tortured Nebula her entire life. Something shown in Guardians 1, 2 and in Infinity War. So it makes sense for him to enjoy torturing Nebula as he really hates her.
Thanos does care for Gamora. That is a fact. It has been shown in various films - sometimes as a plot device to show he doesn't care for Nebula but it doesn't challenge that he does care immensely for Gamora. He has called her ""My favourite daughter"", he has trusted her with acquiring infinity STONES for her. He made her go get two of them. But by doing this it also laid the ground work for showing that he is a bad parental figure due to the abuse, thereby stressing the point that if you love someone do not abuse them. As both times Gamora was sent to get a stone she wanted to use it to kill Thanos. 

Okay now to Thanos. He is a great character and his motivation makes sense on the surface - which is the point. It's not supposed to be right but it's supposed to make one think ""oh he's right"" then realise ""wait why didn't he just increase the resources?"". Thanos is shown to have a cult around him that knows his power. This cult are unlikely to tell him to rethink his plan, they are more likely to tell him how great he is. Thanos's plan is mad and that's how it is supposed to be. If it made sense and was completely justified, then the avengers would be the bad guys. We are shown the story through his perspective in order for us to understand why he is doing this. This type of story writing is needed for the sole purpose of making us understand why we have been told about this character for 6 years and yet not told anything about him. We had to have the character introduced, we had to be given a reason to fear him and we had to understand his way of thinking. So they made him a sympathtic character, that was just completely incorrect. They did that with Killmonger as well. Both of these characters had the belief that they were saving the world but both of them had awful ideas in which to do it. This is what makes them good villains. 

In this film Thanos had to win. If the Avengers beat Thanos in one three hour movie it would seem as though all this build up was for nothing. Thanos needed to win to show that the Avengers really need to work hard if they have a chance at beating this Titan. This was all needed to allow us to feel as though the build up to his character was justified. Now we have to wait until the next film to watch the Avengers try to undo what was done and beat the worst enemy any of them have ever faced. That's something to look forward to. That's something to show that this villain will eventually be beaten. He has to win to make when he actually does lose that much more cathartic. I was really happy with the film. It really lived up to my expectations and I can't wait to see what they do next.

Talking about how they made a movie where the abuser in 2018 was a mistake. Nah that's reality dog.,1,0,2018-09-06T18:38:58.000Z
"So you're saying that this movie's not that great because Thanos, an unapologetically evil, sociopathic ass-hole is the protagonist and he wins? There are tons of movies like these and most of them are really good, cause they subvert expectations. 

And the movie doesn't peddle the idea that abuse equals love, but rather that evil people can treat even the people they love horribly. Or conversely, even an absolute genocidal maniac can have a person they love and they treat infinitely better than all other people. For the former concept, just think of Michael Fassbender's character in 12 Years A Slave, Edwin Epps. He clearly has a thing for Patsey, despite his blatant racism and is mad at himself for loving her. Him raping her is awful, but for him, in his twisted, warped mind, that's the only way he can express his ""love"" for her. Because he thinks black people are objects, his property and he refuses to acknowledge he has feelings for her. Does that movie glorify abuse? Fuck, no... It's still clear that Epps is THE VILLAIN and a HORRIBLE person. And let's not forget that that movie is based on REAL EVENTS, so there are actual people in the actual real world who are just THAT level of comically evil. Thanos is not an unrealistic character from that point of view, no mater how much you'd like to believe he is. And the scenes that seem to be torture porn are necessary. Because they offer a picture of what this man went through. Yes, it's hard to watch sometimes, but does that means it's not a story worth telling? 

For the latter, think about the relationship between Candie and his house slave, Stephen, from Django Unchained. He's a racist piece of shit that any black man in his right mind would want to chop his head off and rape the stump (sorry for that image), but given that he treated Stephen a lot better than all the other slaves, he actually inspired a sort of Stockholm syndrome respect and admiration in the guy, so much so, that he was willing to avenge his death at the cost of his own life. It's complex, baffling relationships like these that are the best and most interesting to see in a movie. And the over-use of the dreaded "" N"" word, does not mean that the movies glorifies racism or that Tarantino is racist (wtf?), but that even the things that are taboo in real life can be shown in a movie as a cautionary tale of what NOT to do. In other words, racism and slavery are BAD (mkay?), but that doesn't mean we shouldn't make works of fiction on this subject, just like on any other. And the examples can go on: drug abuse, murder, war, other forms of bigotry, shit regimes, etc. It's like saying that The Death of Stalin glorifies communism by having Nikita Khrushchev as a protagonist Or that it agrees with unhinged mad men commanding huge armies, just because it makes fun of General Zhukov and his insanity and the fact that he also wins in the end, when h'es the one who basically does Beria in. 

And this tone of the movie doesn't clash with the humor in it, it just enhances it. Because it makes it really DARK humor (the best kind). Let's not forget that all humor is born from a place of pain. I could not disagree more with this video essay. It's about time that Disney got a little out of their comfort zone and showed kids that the world is not just rainbows and butterflies. This is how you implement a dark tone in a movie, not just dark for dark's sake, like the DCEU does it...",1,0,2018-09-06T17:29:30.000Z

1) why was gamora crying after stabbing thanks
- I just assumed she was crying in a sort of release way. Like when someone has huge implications and finally is over a person can just become completely overwhelmed with the release of all the emotion leading up to that point and crying is a good way of expressing that release. 

2) having no main hero narrative to empathise with in the movie? 
For me it was Thor. Even through bitty screen time it was his arc that went through looking everything to using that to gain strength to come back from it.

"I thought the point of writing Thanos the way they did was to show that he isn't some mindless brute.  He has depth but his ideas about life, love and responsibility are all twisted like many villains. They writers weren't trying to say Thanos was right.  It was just this is the character of this character and even though you see his line of logic, you can clearly see that his logic is flawed. They weren't trying to make Thanos the hero.  He is clearly the villain, but this movie is mostly told from Thanos's POV so he's only the hero of his own story, not the real story.  And frankly, they kinda had to give him that room because Thanos in the MCU has basically had no development up to this movie and a pretty weak setup.  They had to let us get to know him in an effective way and it worked.

Also, it's almost not even fair to judge Infinity War on it's own.  It's essentially part 1 of this story so I end up just accepting at such.  They had to make good on the threat of Thanos.  He's been looming in the background since Avengers.  They had to make him a proper menace.  So yes this movie went to some dark places that the MCU has never taken us before but I thought it served the character and this part of the story.

"I appreciate ur essays. I couldn't disagree with you more on this. And not just because I really enjoyed the movie. But because of your central thesis that Marvel is conflating abuse with love. I don't know the answer to the question of whether or not a homicidal sociopath is capable of love any more than you do. But here Marvel hypothesizes that he is and that Gamora is someone he loves, in the only way he knows how. My accepting hypothesis for the purpose of this movie doesn't mean I accept that abusers deserve sympathy. Its suspension of disbelief, which is part of every movie going experience. Also, I disagree with your claim that Thanos' idea is a knock on the writers and not the character. In the source material Thanos wants to kill half the universe to appease the personification of death, with whom he is in ""love"" (here again, the homicidal sociopath is hypothesized to be capable of love, in an obviously bizarre and complex way). That rationale is far sillier than what the writers did for this movie but no different than countless movies where characters commit unconscionable things in the name of ""love"". The use of the word love by the character may not fit your or my definition of love but since when does anyone see ""love"" the same way? And finally, your view that Peter Quill devolved to his original man-child persona is absurd. The problem is you thinking the lesson from the two Guardians movies is that he learned how to be ""an adult"".  He never did that. He used a Pacman character in his fight with Ego for crying out loud. The previous two Guardians movies were about him realizing he could find a family outside of his mother (who he regretted running away from) and father (who he'd built up as this awesome hero figure). The Guardians became his family. But he was and always will be a man-child. Its part of his charm.  but like i said, I appreciate ur essays.

"Honestly it didn’t want to agree with you at all, but you make some very good points. I would agree that they needed to portray thanos as a much more egotistical and closed-minded villian, which would help to show that he isn’t necessarily “in the right”",0,0,2018-09-06T00:10:49.000Z
"There seems to be a lot of confusion between the terms ""protagonist""—the leading character in a story—and ""hero""—a person who is idealized or looked up to because of achievements or noble qualities. Those two terms exist independent of one another. Someone can be both a protagonist and a hero or a protagonist and a villain, but not both the hero and the villain. Thanos exists in the second of these two options: both protagonist and villain. His portrayal in the movie is one of the MAIN character, but not the character we should be rooting for.

Everything else discussed in this video just...falls apart in light of that. His plan is evil and short-sighted, his love/abuse paradigm is part of his evil (or brokenness), and his ""victory"" is one we're MEANT to see undone when the actual heroes come back and rectify the situation.

I've loved every video you, Mikey, have made, but this one feels like a clusterhug of problems that just...don't really make sense when analyzed. I'm guessing this movie affected you in a dark way, but this breakdown doesn't feel as well-thought as literally every other piece of content I've ever seen you produce.

"It's a dark film and that's not how the MCU has been, mostly. But this is a realization of what would happen with an enemy like thanos. You have these super bright and good heroes and an ultimate dark shadow for them to fight. Sorry that the villains got A movie, but this is The villain to give A movie to. This is the part of the concept of a hero, to be a hero there must be someone at risk of suffering and this movie shows what happens when that risk is realized through the hero's constant failure through 1/2 wins. And in the end, the heroes will win and everyone will come back to life and the lesson will be that sometime you have to wade through the pain to get to your goal and that learning lessons too late can have a dire cost.",0,0,2018-09-05T23:26:21.000Z

"I have to say i found your take on the movie silly and childish, films need to tackle this kind of topics, we need to understand and relate to the evils inside us all, when we see a movie about employes robbing the bank they were just fierd from we can relate to that even though that is illeagel  we can relate to that and better understand why our society works the way it does and why we keep our jobs and when you make a film about hanibal lechter and give him polished and wise dioluge  we can better understand the evils that lay within us all, films place a lens on society and blows it up ten times bigger and higher stakes in evey way, what better way is there to ground us to possibly the largest scale of storytelling ever accomplished in cinema than the things we can all mostly relate to, those moments in your life when everything feels like it in the balance, a choise that can cost you your reletioship with a loved one for perhaps a better future for yourself and perhaps your entire social standing, having to feel mistreated by a loved one and yet still stay with them nd find some comfort in the familiar pain and become attached to the abuser, these are elements to ground the movie to emotions that ressonate in us as a society, and yes the movie does end on a sorrow full tone, this is not the only film that did this, the dark knight gave us a violent lunatic and showed us how he strrips the very fabric of the society of gotham, driving many to kill in he's name and take up his cause, and in the end there was no happy ending, the Joker litterally forcing Gotham's great savior in to a mad man of the same making as him, at the same time achiveing to force our hero to break his one and only rule that was the back bone of the only way Batman saw himself as a hero and above the common criminal taking the law in to his own hands, being able to tackle such things is a fit of greatness and is trully Art.",1,0,2018-09-05T22:06:05.000Z

On earth, birth rates have dropped to or below replacement rate in every country where birth control, vaccines, and antibiotics are easily accessible and women are at or near parity with men in education and the workforce.  The hunger etc. that exists is more an issue of uneven distribution of resources than of too many people.  Either way, Thanos's idea is dumb, but NO ONE SAYS THAT.

"I think you're super missing the point of the movie. Perhaps your vision has been clouded by past abuse or traumatic events, which I totally understand.

Quill absolutely loves Gamora. How you can say he ""might"" love her is pretty baffling.

Gamora cries when she stabs Thanos because of the surge of emotions seeing her abuser dead on the ground. It's pure catharsis.

Thanos is an abusive piece of shit, but that doesn't mean he is incapable of loving Gamora. My mother used to take a belt to me growing up, and I resented her for it and told her as much as I got older, but I never doubted that she loved me and thought she was doing what was right. But that said, in no way is this film teaching kids that ""abuse = love"". Every character in the film tells Thanos he's full of shit whenever he says he has suffered loss or heartbreak. It's pretty hamfisted.

On another note: what if the Skrulls were so deeply ingrained in the universe that the only way to eradicate them was to perform the snapture? How would this change the message of the film?

"Love your channel but i can't disagree more with video.
I've had to live with with abusive, narcissistic people in my life and i think Thanos does a great job of capturing that. He is the most misguided character in the piece and it's meant to be that way. his abuse is not love it's what he perceives love as. He takes a twisted sort of satisfaction out of controlling people, and wants ownership and obedience out of his own children more then anything else. He adopts Gamora to make himself feel better about slaughtering half of her species. As a trophy or living proof of how he thinks he helped people prosper. He believes that he and he alone can make the right decision for the entire universe, and while he does this because of his tragic backstory abusive people often come out of tragic situations. His narcissistic nature leads him to want to be right more then he even believes it to be true. The message is not that Thanos is right.

Also i disagree with the sentiment that Marvel movies are for everyone. i didn't enjoy Thor Ragnarok, not because it was awful, but because the dramatic tone shift was not what i wanted from a Thor movie. That being said if you don't put a piece of yourself into a movie it's just gonna be an empty husk devoid of anything meaningful. It's not the end of the story. I understand and sympathize with not being on board for a much darker tone i think that it serves the story and personally i care much more about that then if it's more generally well liked. even if i'm wrong for feeling that way.

About the plan...
I don't think it's one hundred percent sound by any means but the MCU takes place in a vast universe, where space travel is the norm for just about every civilized race except for earth. so we can assume that humans will be able to inhabit multiple planets in the future, so wiping the population will go a lot farther then 2000 years. Besides, this is more for the universe as a whole and not just earth.

While i disagree with the points about the Guardians of the galaxy completely. This comment is already really long. though i do have to say that Peter and Gamora's relationship is not one of ownership just because he said she was his girl XD ! It's not the greatest, and most realistic love story by any means but it's far from abusive territory.

It's the culmination i don't get the complaint about the stakes except for the point about the future. But even with that this film and this moment in time was everything i could have wanted for what will be the penultimate chapter for many of these characters.",1,0,2018-09-05T06:40:26.000Z
The marvel movies have always had a dark narrative but it was also solved by someone who was put through said trauma found a way to overcome and fight it similar to how gamora is horrified when she learns the hard truth and how peter loses it when he finds out that she died and how every superhero is doing everything they can to stop him.

"Beyond the fact that the thesis of the video jumps around, going from ""the writers are taking light of serious things, from killing refugees to abuse"" to ""Thanos shouldn't do bad things because he's the protagonist"" to ""the Guardians are poorly written,"" the former two of which are views I think are actually supported by the movie itself. Thanos leaves a wake of destruction wherever he goes. *Superheroes*, personifications of morality, devote their entire beings to fighting a villain which is practically an on-the-nose personification of abuse itself. Do we need a big cue card that says ""boo"" to come down when he stabs Heimdall in the heart? Sure, I guess I get that some of the scenes can hit close to home, and I don't feel comfortable speaking on how other people handle past trauma, but the idea that Marvel is *condoning* abuse based really only on the fact that he gets the Soul Stone just seems myopic. The fact that anyone watched a former Nazi commander, literally named **Red Skull**, say that a cosmic gem, that's known for itself being manipulative and coercing its wielders into doing evil for its own evil sake, and came away thinking ""The Russos want the audience to support this!"" is really nothing less than appalling. It would be like arguing that Black Panther ridicules afrofuturist movements by making T'Challa start out kind of stubborn, or that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes condones animal abuse because the humans shoot at apes in the climax.

"Okay as an abuse survivor I read this very differently. Now I was not abused as a child so I don't know if it's different. Yet I read it that according to Thanos he loves her, but that it was always toxic and poisonous. Abusers will attest over and over that they love their victims. They're say  it to other people even when their victim gets away. From all mental health professionals I've spoken to it is the ""love"" they're capable of. For Thanos it felt like sacrifice. 

I also read it different that when Gamora stabs him it wasn't mourning his death, but the death of her innocence, the end of her abuser, relief in freedom. Basically all the emotions I had to contend with when I escaped (okay not that he was dead, but that he was out of my life). That she wsa simply overwhelmed and that HE interpreted that with affection and love.",0,0,2018-09-04T21:36:12.000Z

"Way off the mark on this one. Depiction DOES NOT EQUAL endorsement.

This conversation comes up every time someone writes a nuanced, multi-faceted story about a truly despicable villain, real or fictitious. The conversation roared with ""Downfall"" in 2004, it raged with ""The Act of Killing"" in 2012, and here we are again in 2018. Yes, depiction of any despicable, horrific act on-screen will ALWAYS find some portion of the population enjoying it in the way not intended. Murder will thrill some, rape will titillate some, torture will entice some...it is unavoidable. But you betray yourself and you betray the audience by proclaiming depiction is endorsement. You tie storytellers down to the worst laws of puritanism for the sake of avoiding that which makes you uncomfortable. Censorship at it's worst.

It's this lack of ability to adequately critically analyze the human condition without emotional bias that is the heart of the problem with this video. If you can't compartmentalize what you watch without descending into a never-ending slope of weaponized empathy for the upset feelings of ""lots of people"" then you analysis deserves to be criticized. And the irony of it all is right in your own video you rail against simplistic caricatures of character complexity. This is the type of analysis that comes from decades of digesting a diet of popular culture that coddles and caters to the audience. And I'm really shocked this is coming from the same critic that praised and defended ""The Last Jedi"", another unrelentingly dour film that also tore the film-going public (and the man-childish Star Wars fandom) out of it's sheltered comfort zone to broaden the depth of the Star Wars IP and give the series some real stakes for the first time in nearly 20 years.

Yes, I had to recognize when I felt sympathy or empathy for Thanos in this film. It made me feel very uncomfortable at times when my own understanding and emotions made me feel for such a horrifying monster. But that is EXACTLY what the point is, to present this villain as human, to force us to face our own failings, to force us to critically analyze, to rationalize, to compartmentalize and intellectualize all we see and feel to arrive at a truly nuanced, intelligent morality for this fictional villain. Dismissing people as ""just evil"" does all of us a disservice and destroys our ability to argue, counter and confront the worst criminals and the crimes they commit in our own lives. There is so much to learn about ourselves and others through a story like ""Avengers: Infinity War"" that it is a tragic loss to dismiss it with cheap disdain like this video. And a film like Infinity War reaches sooooooo many more people it is a gift that something this nuanced, intelligent and relevant has found such a massive audience.

Real villains don't twirl their moustache, pet their cat and laugh maniacally. Abusers. bullies, despots, authoritarians, dictators...they are all uncomfortably, painfully, human. They have human thoughts, human feelings, human motives, human interests, and human reasons for why they do the most horrific things. That is what is truly disturbing and that is what is worth understanding, reasoning, countering and fighting. Our goal as a species is to learn, act and overcome and we can't do that if we infantilize ourselves with cartoon depictions of the human condition in the entertainment we consume. I think journalist Chris Hedges put it best when he wrote ""it is not the demonized, easily digestible caricature of a mass murderer that most disturbs us. It is the human being""",6,0,2018-09-04T20:44:17.000Z

"But the fact he is stubborn about his stupid plan is empathetic... He is a commentary on how humans anchor to decisions, even when they have been shown beyond a shadow of a doubt they are wrong. We have emotional attachment to our decisions, especially when we act on them. Before Thanos got the gems he was already killing people. It was decided at that point. He could physically have doubled the resources of the universe... But he couldn't emotionally. He made so many decisions that caused him to disassociate from right and wrong...  if he changed course he would be admitting he was wrong and there was another way. He would be admitting to himself he is a monster. That dissociative state is how Thanos holds it together.

"Oh my god so many people are misunderstanding your point it's insane. Yeah, the movie does show abuse, and how the abused goes into this Stockholm syndrome relationship with their abuser, yet they never punish the abuser, they never punish Thanos for anything other than wanting to kill off half the planet. And it's funny because, while the latter is perceived as the big crime,  it's what he does to those girls that does the most harm. And we know that children who are abused often continue the cycle of abuse, or enable it in others, so his selfish actions lead to so much pain, far beyond just the death of those people. And yet the story never focuses on that, they just reward this cycle of abuse with more abuse, and sacrifice the victim as if it's some great act. I mean I don't doubt that Thanos thinks he loves Gamorra, but as you point out yourself, that's not love. But no one, except starlord, understands or cares about it. It's funny, not even the person who loves her understands the nature and extent of the abuse she suffered, and he doesn't respect her pain. It's symptomatic of how people view this kind of trauma, and the kind of incredulity people exhibit when they are presented it. I do wish Thanos was presented as a villain for more than just the indiscriminate torture he inflicts on everyone around him, and that his behaviour would have been met with more force from everyone, but primarily from Gamorra.",0,1,2018-09-04T19:17:03.000Z

"You're right, Thanos was a bad guy with a bad plan to do bad things. But...
Loki wanted to enslave the entirety of Earth's population by hostile takeover and the obvious deaths of thousands of innocents. But we sympathize with his death because of his relationship with his brother, which is his one relatable aspect as a character.
The Vulture did things that were wrong, like stealing very dangerous tech and selling it to criminals. He also threatens to kill Peter Parker, a teenager, if he doesn't back off, and he even attempted to kill him. But we sympathize with him because we understand his financial struggle and his frustration with being the guy everyone steps on.
Killmonger destroyed the traditions of an ancient culture and intended to subdue the entire world under Wakandan rule by hostile takeover and the obvious deaths of thousands of innocents. But we sympathize with him because we understand his anger and pain.

But if we sympathize with a character who feels a strong, albeit potentially misplaced, fatherly connection to another character, that's crossing the line?

"I agree with you unreservedly about the handling of the guardians, and I genuinely feel you on your other frustrations. I agree that the tone stayed too abusively dark to remain engaging, and I think that without that ability to engage a lot of the real impact was lost. 

I hope I'm not just chorusing-up, though, if I assert that, in terms of meta-movie information like interviews and previews and web content, Marvel has been one of the most canny and self-aware press-junketeers since basically the beginning of the internet age. For this reason, I do hold out hope that the interviews with the creators that seem like their intentions were as wrongheaded as their impact are part of the careful cultivation of loathing, and then the preserving our outrage over the idea that Thanos won on every level and is not going to be stopped by anyone really, not even the creators.

The reason I hold out this hope is that Thanos very deftly represents everything that's wrong with comics and comic heroes, and I don't think that's a mistake. He's a window into what is horrifying about Batman and Superman and Captain Marvel, people with power and misplace-able certainty and a willingness that borders on a religious calling to heed their own impulse to correct the world from their own limited-but-writer-indulged perspective. 

For an audience to really be invited to get that, we do need the outer illusion that the creators look at him as sympathetic, we do need the pretense that his abuse is somehow noble. He is the paternalism that Tony Stark has wrestled with since movie one, and the absolute failure of Spiderman's mantra about the reality of power. He is the horror of responsibility treated as just another form of power, and power treated as a justification. He's wrong, he's selfish, he's egotistical, he's cruel, but he's got a big square chin and a righteous-man's line of BS and the love of his creator so who cares if he's wrong? He gets to murder some people that, to him, are faceless extras (but who this time are our emotional stand-ins and touchstones) and then simper nobly at a sunset and sleep good at night. That's Batman, that's shitty-dark ""v. Superman"", and it's an incredibly important (and toxic, and pervasive) monster a responsible franchise needs to tackle before it introduces its own righteous nuke, Captain Marvel. 

So yeah, I do still hold out hope that they've set up this loathsome situation to ultimately teach a lesson that needs to not be forgotten...that this is what it feels like on the wrong side of every ""superhero"" narrative that loses track of the difference between a protagonist and a hero, that thinks ""love"" is something told rather than shown, and expects us to stay on board anyway. I'll be really disappointed and eat a lot of crow if they fumble that message or the cathartic redemption of our trust as badly as they fumbled the cliff scene, which is a definite possibility, but I see so many places where that seems to be what they're setting up and have been setting up this entire time with all the themes of paternal conflict that I do yet hold out hope.",0,1,2018-09-04T14:01:28.000Z

"I think you've missed the point of a few things.

1) the narrative of the movie was set 30(?) Years ago with the comic book version of this story. So even though killing half the universe doesn't make sense based on his motivation, the plot is restricted by the need to hit those narrative points.

2) thanos isn't actually mad or insane - this is a prejorative term used by people to justify horrific acts. It's a label in this case (made from ignorance), not a diagnosis. Yes this is a hangover from.comic boom writing, but it is also ubiquitous in our media & culture.

3) thanos is evil. He is also narcissistic. He justifies his actions by claiming to be the only one who understands.

His abuse is evil.... Just as it is when perpetrated by real people. His ""love"" for garmorra is derived from narcicistic attachment to her...... She is important ONLY because he has that opinion.

These traits of evil in Thanos are like real acts of evil. His evil isn't comic-book-esque over the top theatrics.... It is real evil: torture both physical & emotional, genocide, manipulation.... These are things humans do in reality.



On the ""killing half of everything"" math..... This only makes zero sense when considering the shortcut of using the stones.

He was already doing this, planet by planet.

When it is an inexorable gradual process (since he is immortal), he takes on the role of a plague.... And while we know this is a re-set where he halved the universe in one go, there's nothing stopping him continuing to halve populations again in the future. He's on a break from being an asshole.... He hasn't retired.",0,0,2018-09-04T11:24:59.000Z
"As someone who was abused in the past, ths movie made me feel in so many ways, but in not a single time did I feel like they tried to justify abuse.

Like when people try to feel for others like when someone says that a child or adult that is abused will see this movie and this ""oh this is ok"", No no no no and no. I hate the whole SJW sentiment of putting your feelings for someone else like when a white male is offended for a black man because someone said the n word in the past but that black man doesn't care. Now i understand that you might be trying to generalize what could be a reaction that someone has, but being who i am and what I've dealt with i cant see anyone feeling that way and i could even see an abuser seeing this and feel somewhat wrong. Even though i know that even abusers have love and some dont realize its abuse. I do feel a lot of rage for that person but like gemora i would cry if they died because deep down i love a part of them that showed love towards me.

"Honestly, you already lost me when you complained about the Guardians not being the Guardians because the Guardians are the way they are in Infinity war is because James Gunn had major input in it. They even rewrote the scene when Quill shots Gamora because James Gunn insisted that he would do it. 

But the bigger problem here is that you don't seem to understand that love is not some pure, untouchable thing. I noticed that about quite a lot of people who commented on Infinity war. I wonder at this point if it is a matter of live experience…

Love is complicated. You can love your abuser. Your abuser can feel love for you. For example parents who don't vaccinate their children are effectively abusing them, because they withhold something from them which might rescue their life or their health down the line. But they don't do it because they mean harm, they do it out of love. When Yondu tells Peter to man up, he wants to prepare him for survival, but he is also abusing Peter. And Thanos, he loves Gamora. He hurts Nebula instead of her. He sits down on the steps because she says that she doesn't like the throne. He brings her something to eat. He tells off Ronan for ""losing her"" instead of blaming her for running away. That doesn't mean that he didn't abuse her, too. That doesn't mean that he isn't a monster.",51,0,2018-09-04T11:07:41.000Z

We know just how much she hates him for everything he's done and everything he is, but she still can't escape the conflict and warped paternal connection that he has imbued in her. Thanos meanwhile does genuinely seem to love Gamora, but we see that he is willing to kill her in the pursuit of his insane goal, a goal that he could probably achieve through other means.

"This point that people keep making about ""He just essentially sent Earth back 50 years!"" isn't entirely valid. Yes, Earth is now at levels of population that reflect the 1970's, but what about aliens? If we've seen every species already in GotG, which is a big if because we don't know if that's all of them, then there are only around 20 different kinds of beings in the universe. We aren't talking ""He downsized half of Earth's population."" We're talking ""He downsized half of the population of the entire universe, but spared Earth because he respected Tony."" We don't know if he did the same for other species, but I'd be willing to bet that some were cut by 3/4 of their population, some may now be extinct because Thanos didn't see a use for them. The Avengers are trying to save Earth I get that those are the immediate consequences we as audience deal with emotionally,but he cut every. Living. Thing. Down to half. It's a much bigger picture than just Earth.

Other than that, this whole abuse situation and the way you approach it is ludicrous. You've ingested it in such a way that paints it as a nonsensical support of abuse, equating it to love, but you've got it all wrong. You said it yourself, Thanos is a stubborn, ignorant, abhorrent man. He does love his daughters but because of his mindset and unwillingness to change his ways he ends up hurting them. They are his pupils, they were supposed to be his warlords that would fight by his side, helping him ""save"" the universe, but when they rejected his views and went separately he refused to accept, as he is prone to do, and now he fights to put them back on track. That is his inner struggle. A man who doesn't see his ignorance, one who knows he is right, and fights to make his daughters see the same, even if it means hurting them. 

Your analysis of when Gamora cries is very incorrect as well. It would be stupid to assume she is crying because of some love she has for him because she hates him. Lets walk in her shoes for a second. You are standing face to face with your murderous, unsympathetic father, who not only orphaned you but wasted your childhood in some hope that he would craft you into a killing machine, which he succeeded in, then began a plan to wipe out half of all existing life. Then you kill him. Imagine the weight that carries. I mean... how did you misconstrue this? She's crying because in that moment every horrible moment of her life came rushing back, and she is finally free of this anvil sitting on her shoulders.

"Umm... No. No, I'm sorry. I never once thought of characters such as Harleen Quinzel, Harvey Dent, Victor Fries, Arnold Wesker, Maxie Zeus, or Mary Dahl as ""inherently not worth saving"" and neither did Batman. The idea that these people never get the help they need is itself a criticism of how the world perceives & reacts to mental illness. School shooters are often diagnosed as being mentally ill (obviously, who in their right mind would do such a thing?). Instead of vying for their rehabilitation, society would rather lock them up & throw away the key. So no, that's not a comic book problem, that's a real world issue. If anything, comics such as (or akin to) Batman teach adolescents like me to empathize with those who we may otherwise veiw as our enemy. Being a detective first, Batman always attempts to uncover his adversaries' motivations as well as their internal logic. Batman seeks to understand his villians, not only for the purposes of saving their would-be victims, but also to save the villians from becoming murderers. That's one of the reasons he doesn't cross that line himself; Batman wants to help, not destroy. Look no further for evidence of this then The Killing Joke. The Joker cripples & sexually assualts Barbara just to prove a point, yet Batman still offers to help rehabilitate him.

I'm sorry your feeling down about Infinity War but please don't say that there is something wrong or ""detrimental"" with Batman comics man. I love those comics. Not all of them, just the good ones, written by people who understand what makes Batman a great character.

"I'm sorry but no, I love your videos man but this is just a bad take. Disney and Marvel are not justifying abuse and are in no way equating it with love. I'm taking psychology as part of my education degree and one of the first things we discussed was abuse. Due to their own experiences in early development, abusers equate the abuse they experienced - and eventually the abuse they perform on others - with love, it's the only form of interaction they got with their parents, people who should love them and so they think abuse is love. Abusers still love their abuse victims and victims can still love those who abuse them, it's the reason abusive relationships continue, victims still love the abuser and think that they can help them. Gamora crying after ""killing"" Thanos could either be due to this fact (that she still loved her abusive father) and or just because of catharsis. She's finally letting out all the emotions she repressed for years. I was abused as a child, my father would beat the crap out of me, my mother would tell me it's my fault but I still love my parents even if I still have this intense hatred for what they did, I know they can't help it because of their much worse circumstances growing up.

I don't agree with your summation of the Guardians. When we pick up here we're about 4 years on from Guardians 1 and 2 (been confirmed by Marvel) and so we have no idea where they're at as a team and family by this point, other than what we are shown in the movie. Quill's whole attitude in this movie isn't out of character for him. He saw his mother die at the age of like 8 and was immediately abducted by aliens and for 30 years raised by criminals in a place so incredibly divorced from his old life. He never got to have a normal life. Gamora became an almost surrogate mother for him (sounds weird now that I write it) and so he'd definitely be selfish about anything to do with her. His freakout very clearly was due not only to Gamora's death but also repressed emotions he still has about his mother's death (on top of the fact that he killed his father and took for granted the scumbag that tried to raise him until he sacrificed his life for him). Anything the Guardians did in this movie was okayed by James Gunn, he was brought on to make sure the writers got his characters right.      

Lastly, I'm not an ironic Thanos apologist but his whole plan IS a viable option, it's not a just and moral one but it's correct. Why do we cull a herd of deer? They are growing too quickly in relative captivity and are using up all the resources. Some have pointed out, well why couldn't he just make more resources? That's not how the infinity stones work, they can't create matter, only change it. Another thing is that Thanos clearly views this culling of the universe as only the first and one day another will have to do what he has done. Thanos views himself as a saviour for doing this, that's WHY he's the villain, he's doing a very shitty thing for the wrong reasons but with the goal of an outcome he deems as good. He's literally like any villain or shitty person in history, you can understand their point, it doesn't mean you are agreeing with them that it's right. Hitler thought killing millions of my people was for a good cause, one can see that he thought he was right, he's still a fucking cunt for doing so. 

Your point about the deaths being meaningless is something I've seen a lot since the movie came out but I think it's the wrong way to look at it. The deaths aren't just for shock value, they were a message to the heroes that they have well and truly lost. They are no longer the undefeated, Earth's mightiest heroes. They lost, not only that but their friends are gone. These deaths, although temporary, are to push the remaining Avengers to take Thanos seriously. The snap wasn't for us, it was for the heroes.",45,6,2018-09-04T00:46:23.000Z
"If you listen to the directors commentary, the Russos and Markus & McFeely explicitly acknowledge that Thanos is a manipulative, sociopathic abuser. He still, however, loves Gamora in a twisted way.

"No, the Thanos and Gamora plot is a realistic depiction of parental abuse.
Anyone who's from an abusive family was able to get it.
You're right that abuse was a core theme of Thanos but you missed everything about how it extrapolated every evil deed from real life abusive parenting practices.

Abusive parents often hold god complexes over their children and brainwash them to view them as the ultimate authority.
Thanos represented this by treating himself as a literal Messiah, indoctrinating his children: the black order into a personal  religious cult.

Thanos and Gamora loved eachother because real life abusive parents and abused children love eachother. Loving your parents is not a choice. It's how you instinctively feel about the literal closest people to you in your early life. It's a social, societal and emotional obligation, especially if you come from a time or place where child abuse is more common and not considered abuse. 

It seems like you just saw a movie where the abuser won, and instead of assessing the purpose of the abuse plot (which was to empathise with Gamora) jumped to the conclusion that they were glorifying Thanos's actions so you spent 20 minutes trying to deligitimise a completely legitimate allegory for a legitimate problem.",335,14,2018-09-03T15:32:20.000Z

Would you rather the movie not show the reality and complexity this relationship can ultimately have? And the very possible grim outcome this relationship can ultimately have?

I'm sorry, but you do realize that's the Rebuttal to the OPPOSING argument right? Those who say ""just increase the resources"". Because people will always just speed right back down the same road with those resources, at a FASTER pace given the much larger population relative to the resources.
The point, (as was actually explained outright by Thanos IN THE MOVIE) was that a society that becomes advanced enough to reach the medical/technological/infrastructural breakthroughs that are required to sustain itself nearly perpetually (think green energy and similar post scarcity tech) is nearly always frontloaded by a vastly too great population to undo all the infrastructure and old paradigms to become stable. It's the problem with why India is a literal defecation in the street nation in 2018. It's not that it would be impossible to radically renovate almost every aspect of society, it's that the cost, human and political, is so insurmountably great you just can't. He explains to Gamorra that AFTER he did it to her planet, they rebuilt into a paradise in less than 30 years. Because when you suddenly have empty slums, half the mouths to feed, and the political and economic elites were just as decimated as the poor, it becomes radically easier to rebuild BETTER.

This movie was not made just for you. Movies and books contain traumatic events, some much more so than infinity wars. This depiction of Thanos is actually close to the comic book version where he is neither good nor evil, but intensely devoted to a singular purpose. In the comics it is his love for the embodiment of Death. In the movie it is the universal equivalent of climate change. There is a reason he is called the Mad Titan. His reactions are not understandable to others, just as a psychopath’s are not either.

"*""it is unrelentingly dire"", ""it reminded me of (real world trauma)"". And? Observation, valid. Consequence, not. I'm a little uncertain what your point is. Is it ""a fantasy world (or rather a movie) ought not  be unrepentant in showcasing tragedy or categorical undefeated power which doesn't broach morality as an obstacle""? Why? In an era, of agreed tremendous feelings of powerlessness or inability to stop ""the villain"", why can't a movie showcase that feeling? As you said, it is a story like a season finale, but it would seem to me that like most season finales (at least good ones), this movie could be watched in isolation and it holds up. Admittedly it is a fundamentally different experience than watching it AFTER watching the entire season before, but on the rough elements, all the players fit into common enough archetypes that you could watch the movie and it would still make sense. It redetails just enough critical plot items that you can understand what everything means. So it is either a very dark movie about a categorical unshaken ideology in human(esque) form verses 2 dozen more or less good guys who all don't what people to die, or it is a nuanced capstone chapter to a decade or more of films, and BOTH WORK. It is a dark movie that ends darkly, because it is a villain protagonist story, and it is going to be completed with a comeuppance in part 2. Part one (dark mirrored) hero victory, part two (same) hero defeat.
*Abuse and love. Thanos is abusive. Tremendously. He also is meant to possess love (and least that HE believes he does). Those are 2, interconnected, but not binary facets of his character. The whole point is that for almost every other character he scales back his empathy or love to EVERYONE and thus, to NO ONE. That's a point we are supposed to examine, that he treats Nebula or his other children horribly, not because he hates them or is passively abusive, but because he treats them with the same individual indifference separate to their value in achieving his moral goal. The point is (had they not all been killed by the snap) half of them would live, and half not, AND THAT IS WHAT HIS LOVE TO THEM IS. He blankets a singular concern to trillions (quad/quintillions?) Of people worthy of his act of love for life (in his perspective) that no one person deserves more or less than their gift at the moment of the snap. From his (warped) perspective, to act in love or mercy to ANYONE along the way instantly puts them above his love for EVERY OTHER LIVING THING IN THE UNIVERSE. So we will discuss gamorra. He throws away all the other children like pawns because their measure of love is to be useful to him, in his aim of saving all life. They are pawns who save every other piece by being destroyed. Gamorra is his ONE exception, as he says more or less explicitly. He treats her both as his daughter, whom he cares about, but also with just as much hardship as every other person. These are mutually coexisting paradigms. His solution, more or less, to her defection, is to let her go. That is the compromise of his love of all, which would mandate killing her lest she risk ruining the ""salvation"" of all, and his desire to not hurt her. He just ignores the dissonance. That is his compromise. Until that's no longer an option. Right up to the summit of the soul stone world, you could quite conceivably imagine that if he gets the stone, he won't harm her (or at a minimum won't kill her). The test is important because it acts as a moral event horizon line for him as a character, but more importantly, it is an unavoidable moment where he can not compromise. He is an abuser as someone who can love one person, and he is a hypocrite  as someone who holds the ideal of loving everyone equally. Abuse is not binary to love. And they both exist between them, as he may have neither quality to countless figures. The moment is critical because it juxtaposes love, abuse, ideals, and hypocrisy/pragmatism in a multilateral emotional cataclysm. He can't be all those things any more, he can be loving and a hypocrite, or idealistic and consistent. Thanos is a deeply morally twisted character, but he is such BECAUSE his positive quality is just as real (at a bare minimum from his perspective) as his evil. 
The point of the story is it showcases this very human decision process in several other pairs, and you can see how actually close to us that type of moral point of no return is. 
""Save all life, or save your brother"" -loki
Save your lover, or stop categorical evil - vision and Wanda.
Do what must be done or all is lost, or stall and hope - the entire avengers
Keep one boy away from harm because he is innocent, or let him die because you need him to have a chance at winning - Tony to Peter
Sacrifice your nation and people as a stalling tactic, or lose everyone - T'challa
But most important relative to Thanos: kill the woman you love, or doom everything - gamorra and quill. Thanos isn't disappointed in Peter's hesitation, he celebrates his will: because for Thanos, to sacrifice something insurmountably precious to achieve your ends is proof of character, to sacrifice something you couldn't care less about is easy. Thanos is abusive exactly because he holds his ideal above his love. But that doesn't mean he didn't FEEL love. Real abusers can love those they abuse. That doesn't invalidate either the abuse, or the love.",10,0,2018-09-03T06:07:10.000Z
"The scene with Thanos getting the soul stone would have made more sense if instead of having him do the ""sacrifice,"" he had manipulated another person into doing it so he could then come in and snatch it up for himself amidst said person grieving. Not only would it have fit with the character of Thanos they established previously, but it would have further cemented his placement as the Villain (because protagonist doesn't make you the ""good guy""). Plus it seemed like the direction they were heading anyways with the scene of him utilizing the Reality Gem to make Peter shoot her, but apparently they somebody spilled coffee on that part of the script?

"*1. ""Abuse = love” point*

I think you’re reaching there. I don’t think the movie aptly supports this notion. Sure, Thanos is the protagonist, but he’s not the good guy. Sure, he has a complicated, abusive relationship with his daughter, but the film never portrays the abuse aspect as right/good/okay/etc. It shows abuse, and it shows that he does love her, but it never tries to say that they’re the same thing. Sure, Thanos himself may claim that the abuse was for their own good, but the movie portrays it as a bad thing. Gamorra constantly tells him that what he did was wrong; his actions are portrayed as evil; and the previous Guardians movies plainly spell out that his actions are bad and nothing remotely close to actual love. Not once does the film portray him or his actions as something good or something they’re not (i.e., love). 

Filmmakers have certain responsibilities when it comes to portraying heavier subject matters (like sexual assault, abuse, etc.), but I don’t see how this film was _as_ reckless as you claim in that regard.

*2. Peter’s impulsiveness*

“Coming to grips with adult responsibilities and learning not to be an idiotic manchild”

My memory of the Guardians movies are probably hazy (haven’t rewatched the first one in a while and only saw the second one once when it was in theaters and didn’t enjoy it that much), but how were they about Quill learning to take adult responsibilities and to stop being a manchild? When do the narratives focus on Quill’s manchildness as a substantial issue that he needed to overcome? How does beating up Ronan and killing his evil dad accomplish that? 
I’m genuinely curious because I don’t remember that being the focus.

At what point are adult responsibilities portrayed as something that Peter needs in order to develop as a character? 

(Keeping that in mind) I found Peter’s impulsiveness in attacking Thanos to be completely within character. We know he’s generally an impulsive guy. Hell, when he found out that his dad killed his mom, he *didn’t even hesitate* to kill him, just shot him right away. Now the love of his life who _finally_ opened up to him to the point of wanting to be in a relationship with him, the one person left in his life that he really loved, was killed by the madman that tortured her her entire life - and all for a plan they found to be stupid and wrong no less. AND add that to the fact that he made one of the most difficult decisions earlier in the film to kill Gamorra just to save the universe. Do you understand how hard that must’ve been for him? The amount of willpower and resolve required to do that? All of that resolve and heartbreak was for _nothing_ in the end. You could understand why he’d just fucking snap right on the spot. Hell, he even tried to hold back, unlike his impulsiveness with his father. 

(Sidenote: I also like how it’s a nice juxtaposition between him and Drax. Earlier in the film, he tells Drax to cool it and not be so reckless in attacking Thanos and that they need to stop the bigger plan first. But when push comes to shove, he’s shown to be no different than Drax.)

And if we assume your point about him learning to take more adult responsibilities after the first 2 Guardians films, then one could argue that him putting aside his selfish desires (keeping Gamorra alive)  for the greater good _is_ an example of him being more mature. 

“And makes mistakes that Gamorra pays for with her life”

How did Peter’s mistakes cost Gamorra her life? What mistake are we talking about? Him failing to kill her when she was captured by Thanos?

“The woman he _might_ be in love with”

Wait, what? They clearly state that they love each other in the movie.

*3. Thanos’ plan*

You claim that the filmmakers think Thanos’ plan is right in some way, but I don’t think the film nor the footage you showed supports that. From the film’s perspective, bbviously the good guys/heroes all tell Thanos that he’s wrong. You literally have a scene where Thanos is unable to provide a refute to Gamorra. For crying out loud, the entire film is *all about stopping that*.

The filmmakers you showed all state that Thanos thinks he’s right in _his_ mind/_his_ perspective. I highly doubt that they actually believe that wiping out trillions of living things is an actual practical solution. Thanos is empathetic in the sense that you can understand where he’s coming from to a degree. You can see that he’s not just a 1-dimensional, “do evil things _just_ for the sake of evil"", Saturday morning cartoon villain. Their point is that he’s trying to do good; he has “good intentions” with a _smidge_ (*heavy* emphasis on smidge because we all know how fallacious his Malthusian plan is) of sense to it.

When are villains ever right? Like, _right_ right lol?

And since when does empathetic suddenly equate to believing someone’s right? Not once will you find that to supported by any definition of the word.

The cool thing is that Thanos’ plan doesn’t need to be foolproof in order for the film to work. 

Thanos’ plan is really more of an issue if 1) Someone’s claiming Thanos to be a god-tier villain, or 2) The film portrays it as a correct or viable solution.

I’ve already talked about how the film doesn’t portray it as correct at all, and the title of ""Best Marvel Villain” (as many claim him to be, and is a different discussion for another time) doesn’t equate to a god-tier villain in the grand scheme of things.

He’s a serviceable and competent villain with specks of awesome sauce thrown in there every now and then, but he's nothing I’d call amazing, masterful, or god-tier. And I still heavily enjoyed the film in spite of that.

"I may be echoing the same thing, but Thanos is one of those characters you hope to never meet.

The Mad Titan literally thinks what he is doing is good for the universe, but his logic, if he took the time to really sort through it, would fail the key tests we demand of such a proposition.  However this does not apply to Thanos as his moniker is apt.  He is in love with the personification of Death in the Marvel Universe, and that's creepy enough on its own!

You do miss the point of the complex interaction between Thanos and Gamora, though.  It's something we see everyday, and that reality must echo here in cinema land, too.  *This is not a glorification; it's a condemnation.*  Everything Thanos does is wrong, no matter how cogently his point is said.  This is not Utilitarianism; not everything can be weighed as the greater good for the greater amount of people.  This is not love; this is a corruption of it.  Thanos, in his twisted way, really did love Gamora, but he sacrifices it for power to do as he wills.  I actually applaud Marvel here.  They've hit us so hard in the gut that we end up questioning ourselves as well.

Just what is the greater good?  What are the stakes involved?  How far would you go to get the power to act on your will?  It's fairly clear the message the movie made about Thanos; he's gone too far.  There are now real stakes for the rest of the MCU; the Mad Titan must fall.

This is what I call setting up for the big event.  Yes, however, Empire is a good parallel here.  The sequel will always feel numbing, as it is only the mid-game.  No one really knows what the stakes really are.  We know the stakes out of the gate here, unlike Empire; you don't mess with Thanos, and if you do, go for the head.  He shows no quarter, so you shouldn't either.

"Ok Mikey I respectfully disagree with you, and imo I feel like sometimes you get the wrong impression when films (especially ones that are appropriate for kids) portray negative aspects of life.
Btw this gonna be a long one so TLDR portrayals of negative things in media are usually playing it as bad. From an abusers view they can love the people they abuse, and you can love someone who abuses you even though you hate them. Just because the bad guy won doesn’t mean he’s right. Empathy =/= agreeing with someone.

I first disagreed with you in the Dumbo section of lessons animation taught us. I felt like you were talking away the wrong message of the film. To me the film was portraying bullying as a bad thing, with the mean kids and the mean elephants being an antagonistic force, due to their bad options and abhorrent mistreatment of Dumbo and his mother. I also felt like the movie was again portraying animal cruelty as a bad thing with Dumbo’s mother in captivity. And sure the crazy stunts causing a terrible accident was played for laughs, but then it’s common for terrible situations in entertainment media to be played for laughs, heck we are entertained about watching stories were people fight or cause mass destruction or do other sorts of deplorable acts, and sometimes those actions are portrayed in a humorous light, because entertainment is that way. And the scene with the Dumbo and his mother’s trunk is bittersweet, it’s sweet because Dumbo has some who cares for him, who would look out for him, who loves him, it’s sweet to see a mothers affection for their baby. But Dumbo is crying and the music is sombre because it’s a terrible situation both of them are in, with how terribly the mother is treated. Also I think that cut is to show how amoral the circus mangers are, that all this terrible stuff could have just happened and their just laughing and having the time of their lives, how they don’t have any morals and don’t care. And the mouses speech is the final nail in the coffin to show how terrible all this things are and how scum infested the people are who actually do these things like bullying and animal cruelty ect, and as a kid, I got that.

I bring this up because I feel the same has happened with you and Infinity war, I feel like you took things form the wrong angle. So onto infinity war.

As you say the first thing Thanos does is terrible, but while he’s doing it Ebony Maw acting as a hyperactive mouthpiece for thanos gives a grand, cult like speech about how these actions are good, therefore from the get good we know Thanos’s morals and goals at least are askew. With the dire nature of this film I can agree but I felt that it was necessary to do Thanos justice but you’re completely allowed to subjectivity dislike it and I can completely understand, however one thought I would like to share is that I saw a comic book fans review (that I don’t agree with) of this and he was contrastingly unhappy with the amount of jokes and upbeat beats in this movie, so I think Infinity war may have, at least for the purposes of a general audience, managed to strike a good balance between the dark nature by mellowing it out with its humour. However I don’t think that the film made light of any of the torture, or gut punches, you feel all of them, it just doesn’t dwell to heavily on them as doing so would make the film much more dark and less age appropriate. And I don’t think removing these elements would be good either because then you get a movie that’s dumbed down so that it doesn’t have to deal with darker subject matter, just so the audience doesn’t have to emotionally feel too bad, because media is meant to make us feel many emotions. And it’s not arbitrarily justified, there are many models of how Thanos goal would work and since it hasn’t happened we can’t be sure which model would actually work and how events would actually play out, but for someone twisted like Thanos, who convinced himself that this is the only way, his actions are justified to himself, leading into my next point. Abusers and twisted individuals usually justify their twisted actions to themselves, and the film is not portraying abuse as love, rather that abusers can and do feel love. However there justification for them loving someone, or how they show it ect is twisted but to them they still love that person. As someone living in an abusive relationship, who has seen many psychiatrists and mental help people I can know for a fact my abuser loves me, and that he justifies his abusive or even just wrong actions, and that he thinks what he does is right. Quill didn’t fully grow up and isn’t perfect, a defining trait of Quills was that as soon as something very personal to him was negatively affected he would go ballistic, with his walkman and headphones in 1, with his mother’s life in 2, and with Gamora here. When something like this happens to Quill logic goes out the window, and since he still acted the same way when he found out what his dad did to his mother in 2 this trait of his is still there and he hasn’t grown to where he can make rational decisions in these situations. His unhinged state is further shown in the deleted scene where he is constantly playing the same song over and over for hours in order to deal with the terrible emotional blow that he received and left him in a bad state of mind.Also it wasn’t due to his mistakes that Gamora lost her life, even if Quill went along with Thor’s plan Thor probably wouldn’t have been about to get to Thanos any quicker, and he still probably wouldn’t have been able to definitely kill Thanos, Thor only got that critical shot off on Thanos because he was reeling from putting the mind stone in the gauntlet and utilised that opportunity to strike, if Thor didn’t get that short Thanos would have just had to grab Gamora which would have still been possible and then teleport out and get the soul stone with little resistance. Also I wouldn’t say Quill took ownership of Gamora, neither would I say that Gamora and the soul stone are just a plot device, and again, form their twisted viewpoint abusers love people even if their actions show otherwise. And yes Gamora can love and hate Thanos, just because someone abuses you doesn’t automatically mean you would never be sad if they died, and Gamora has a lot of emotional turmoil over her relationship with Thanos, emotions are not black and white. I wouldn’t say any of the tragedy and truma are cheap shortcuts, heck Thanos has been built up since Avengers 1 and further in Gardians of the galaxy, to be the boss behind these terrible people committing these terrible atrocities, as an audience we can assume Thanos is capably of all of them and more by himself. And all your points about Thanos and his thought process and actions are right, and due to those that’s why he can form his perspective, love Gamora, commit genocide and call it mercy, torture his daughter. And yes Thanos can be empathetic but wrong at the same time, we can put ourselves in Thanos shoes, see where he is coming from and get his goal and why he thinks that way, but that doesn’t mean we’re meant to or supposed to agree with him, heck in the clips you show they’ve said from his point of view, he’s seen and they call him a villain. Just because we can see where are villains are coming form and undesirable their reasoning, doesn’t mean we’re meant to agree with them. Again the stakes aren’t arbitrary, or ludicrous, or for shock value, the stakes are to show us Thanos view, make stakes, and give Thanos a win condition that our heroes must prevent. However marvel can go back to small stakes, with what’s apparently going to be the new leader of the MCU post Avengers 4, Spider-Man. As you said he’s still a kid on the bus, and his villains aren’t going to be end of the world situations, their at most going to be destroyed city villains and at least very bad dudes that will affect the lives of a portion of the common people, and since spidey died I wouldn’t be surprised if Tony de Avengers him and takes the Iron Spidey suit away to keep him form getting involved in Avengers tier situations regularly. And also the scale of Infinity war also allows the stakes to scale with it, one hero or one team can only take on so much, and solo MCU movies will allow the scale and stakes to slide appropriately. Although I can agree that the undo of some of the deaths isn’t the best form a critiquing standpoint. Also Thanos’s black order were necessary because you can’t have 3/2.5/2 teams of Heroes fighting Thanos for 2 hours 30 mins. The black order serve as minibosses before the big boss, and allow our Heroes to have some victories so the movie isn’t completely hopeless. And hey Proxama midnight looks fine, you try having a different fantasy skintone, horns and a humanoid physique and not looking remotely like something from blizzard :P. I would say that we can route for every hero in Infinity war as a collective, just like we route for the avengers or guardians as a collective, though other critics say that Thor is the secondary protagonist and I can see that, and besides some rides are more fun without handlebars. I also have to disagree, there is both a story and an event, the story is Thanos quest for the Infinity stones, and the Heroes quest to unite and stop him.

"I disagree with your points, but it's a well thought out analysis and I can appreciate that",0,0,2018-09-02T19:21:16.000Z
"Point the First:

For all the talk that people make about how comic book movies are changing filmmaking, nobody seems to examine how the flaws of comic books are going to affect films. Hence Infinity War: a dire, miserable abyss with shock value and shock deaths we *know* can't stick because the consequences of all of them would demand a change in writing that no writer, past or present (or that would ever be considered for such a task) can hope to or would desire to follow up on--they forgot that these characters went out for burgers in the past, they'll hit whatever reset button they can to go back to that because they realized too late that all their decisions led to these superheroes not being able to be superheroes anymore. Look at Crisis on Infinite Earths: DC has spent the past 30 years doing nothing but waffle on the consequences of condensing the multiverse, destroying Earth-2 and sacrificing Supergirl. Look at the original Marvel Civil War (character assassination so horrible that it took the original Iron Man film to vindicate the character of Tony Stark). Look at Ultimatum.

They put the cart before the horse and tried to reinvent the wheel, and they don't have the tools to dig themselves out.

They meddled in emotion and trauma that they do not understand, all for shock value, because it's easier than writing proper motivation and sequences of events. Comic fans justify that because ""it's comics""--they've spent so long consuming the medium that anything that doesn't taste like over-salted canned peas doesn't taste like ""real"" peas, even if it's fresh from the vine.

In the comics, Thanos' madness is driven by his desire to seduce Death. This is a point the first Avengers movie underlined in the post-credits stinger. This bizarro ""Mein Kampf""/tortured hero backstory for Thanos is overwrought and needless, because it simply makes him a petulant college communist. He wanted to bone the anthropomorphized manifestation of Death. That's all the motivation we needed.

Point the second:

A lot of people are justifying Thanos' abuse by pointing out that depicting it isn't the same as ""glorifying"" it--but the thing is, trauma doesn't care about your ""intent"". People with deep, emotional scars are going to react to it the same way. It didn't matter that the airhorns in the song that played on the radio weren't real, when my friend E heard them it triggered his PTSD the same way, and he jolted in his seat with an expression on his face that'll haunt me to this very day. That's trauma. The whole ""sorry if you were offended"" thing doesn't work, because the roots of trauma run deep and you have no way of knowing who's affected by it without them telling you. Words have meanings. Actions have consequences. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. It doesn't matter if you didn't ""mean"" to mess up Thanos' abuse to Gamorra and Nebula, because the result is going to feel very goddamned insensitive to people recovering from histories of abuse. If you didn't consider those consequences, you failed as a writer--because words have meaning. You can't pretend they don't.

EDIT: Point the third:

Thanks was written in a time where it's almost impossible to write a despicable, hatable villain without crossing the line. For whatever reason, geek media idolizes villains. It doesn't matter how evil you try to make them, people will blunt the edges and buy the theory that the villain was in the right all along. No act is too vile, no plan too inhuman. Maleficent. Darth Vader. Sephiroth. Voldemort. Hannibal Lecter. It's impossible to make a villain evil enough to trigger the desire in fans to see them defeated, because like Thanos these misguided fans want in the villain's pants. Good is dumb to fans. Evil is sexy. The only way to avoid that would be to make a villain who isn't an interesting character, which nobody responds to.",1,4,2018-09-02T19:20:51.000Z

Because parental relationships are like that. I have to rely on them and because they aren't abusive 100 percent of the time I fall into a cycle of almost forgiving them because I crave a loving relationship with them. From Thanos' perspective he loves Gamora as well. It's not good love or a healthy love but his twisted mind loves her in twisted ways. The infinity stone didn't need true love just a sacrifice of love.

"I really like your show and I like your takes. The portrayal of abuse for the purpose of making money is a long, complicated problem that is unrealistic to target a Marvel movie for.  It is kinda swinging at low hanging fruit that get attention because the movie was the big blockbuster event. Your meditation on how fast the stakes rise is great though. It would have been nice if we had more than 3 comic movies to raise stakes with. 

Also, I understand that all film is subjective. So my option can be pure horse-pucky for someone else. But sometimes you have to take something as a too literal or simple view of a material. Just as someone claiming the 'John Wick' is a horrible movie because it romanticizes and justifies murder and revenge. Someone saying they were repulsed by the images of torture and murder in this movie are not entirely wrong. It is one when the arguments used to justify their sentiment start using out of context moments, strawman arguments, and  false equivalence do I feel the need to speak up and state what I think is wrong with your arguement. 

The main issue I encounter with the point of view you present is the assumption of film shorthand. Now I'm wiling to accept that as a film student you are more versed in this that I am, but I never assume the emotions shown on screen have clear check boxes for what I am supposed to feel. That Gamora cries at the 'death' of Thanos was both the sudden release of emotions of killing the man(monster) who raised her and the sudden realization that the monster who defined her life was gone. She was free and the only reaction to that moment was tears.

I never thought, until I read about this opinion in a blog post that it was just about Gamora being sad her Dad died. Sorry, That seems like taking the whole moment with the most basic reading possible of the scene and because the film short hand of crying = sad is way to simple and basic for me to accept.

Same with the Thanos crying scene. In film short hand, love is positive and abuse is negative. That is it. Say love can only be presented in a positive light and abuse must always be presented in the negative. Full stop. And it isn't like that. Love absolutely can be presented in a negative light and Gamora would have been much better without his 'love.' Now I understand the shout, ""Portraying an abuser as loving their victims is justifying their abuse."" It makes the whole discussion a black and white, good vs evil, all cases have one outcome issue. It is nice to put evil in neat clean boxes so you can curse it easily and cleanly.

The scene of Thanos throwing Gamora was horrific. I will not disagree with you,  is a great issue to discuss if the themes of this movie belong in a marvel movie. But to say this movie's portrayal of the scene justified abusers is disturbingly wrong. The scene was horrific, meaning it was portrayed as the wrong thing. That Thanos had tears in his eyes was showing how terrifying his resolve was, not that we were supposed to feel sympathy for him.  Again, far to limited read of film shorthand.

Thanos was not right. At no point did anyone we had come to trust as heroes in 18! movies ever paused and said, 'wow, I never though of that. You might be right."" Thanos was flat wrong. Only a few people, who are also portrayed as vile murders, follow him. Anyone who watched this movie and though, 'Wow, Thanoes is awesome for how right he is.' Needs a serious education on population growth. Also, people was blindly follow everything an egomanical authority figure says just because he projects power and strength needs to have Captain America kick their ass. 'I'm the only one who knows' should always be your first clue something is wrong with their logic.

So I cannot accept the logic presented in your video or in the dozen other places I have encounter this same conversation. It seems to take a thing (Thanos tears, Gamora tears) out of the context presented in the movie and says, 'oh this means she is sad her dad is dead"" and ""Oh he cries, we are supposed to sympathize with him and it justifies his abuse."" Sorry, this is projecting. It was pretty clear, to me, that those statements are a simple and poor reading on the movie at hand.

Now, I do want to say, as an exit,  this movie is a blindsiding monster. The absolute joy (with themes and genocide, slavery, jovial tyrants) of 'Ragnarok' was a poor lead-in to 'Infinity War.' If a person was not ready for, or thought is was a good idea for six year-olds, should have had something to let them know this was not a cute and friendly movie. This movie would stand as a great justification for trigger warnings so people were not blindsided.

"Agree 100%. Came out of this movie feeling the same way, but you articulate it better than I could. 
How I would sum it up is that we are told that Thanos is the bad guy (and yes, he his the protagonist), but THE MOVIE keeps telling us that he's in the right. His ideology is never challenged in an effective way. Sure, Thanos wins the fight, but he should have lost the argument. Unfortunately, the movie reads like he had the intellectual high ground all along. I would have liked to scream ""Thomas Malthus"" at him.
Thanos isn't mad, or crazy... he's stupid and violent. He's a brute with power who believes he's got everything figured out with his simple 2+2 solution. He confuses eloquence with reason, and conviction with narrow mindedness. Unfortunately, the movie (and possibly the people who made the movie) do not appear to be aware of this and leave him unchallenged in that respect.
He is also abusive, has you pointed out, but never gets call out for it. People scream, but they never talk back at him in an effective way.
On first viewing, I kept expecting one of the hero characters to give him a solid intellectual smack down, maybe at the very end after his murderous plan comes to fruition... But it never came. I keep hoping they are saving it for part 2, but if that is the case, I believe it was a mistake to leave it out of part 1.",4,1,2018-09-02T15:10:11.000Z
"Oh come on you big baby, it's not supposed to be ""justified"" when Thanos throws Gamora off the cliff, it's supposed to show that he does love Gamora, but as much as he does, he is more determined to complete his plan.

And with the trauma for entertainment thing, are you saying that no movie should deal with intense and quite taboo issues in order to more realistically tell a narrative, because ""muh feelings""? Come on.

In terms of the Thanos being empathetic thing, he is. He was, whether misguided or not, was being empathetic. I truely believe he wanted the best for the universe, and I truely believe that he thought this was the only way to do it. 

Also, you've got to understand that when you are making a film with dozens of main characters on screen at once, you can't dedicate a complex narrative to any one of them. Instead, what the did was have them all go off in groups to share the load of the story.

"One more addition, after watching the ""Where does it go from here"" portion. I don't think that this just gets undone by the next movies. Even if characters return, even if their end isn't ""Dust"", they are not the same characters anymore. The Marvel movies have proved to us that death is not the only outcome, that emotional stakes matter because emotional changes matter. Even if Spiderman and Black Panther, and all of the Guardians return, they will not be the same people. Stark will have seen what he always feared come to fruition, the suffering of others that his own power could not stop. Wakanda will see itself without its' king. Captain America will have seen his best friend die one more time, after throwing away everything he thought he had held dear to protect him. Those changes cannot be undone.

One day during yet another argument i couldn't take it anymore and hit my dad first, he looked at me like i was a monster and in complete silence he walked out of the house with disappointment on his face. All the desperation and pain i felt turned into tears as i realized what i just did, i was crying, shaking and lost control of any muscle in my body as i just did the most terrifying thing in my life. From that day on the beating stopped and years later my parents are now divorced and i live on my own but just thinking back brings shivers all over my body and tears in my eyes, so Gamoras' reaction was flawless in my opinion.

"It is difficult to argue against someone who is legitimately triggered by the trauma that occurs in Infinity War, but I do think that the most important aspect of Thanos is not the idea that he is meant to depict someone that is mentally ill, but that he is someone that is absolutely of sound mind, doing what THEY believe to be the right thing using incredibly faulty logic. And there is incredible historical precedent for that.

How many history books look at something like the dropping of the atomic bomb on two separate cities and frames them as empathetic. As America hoping to save American lives by atomizing those of our enemies, who we are now intrinsically valuing as ""less"". How many children grow up having to wrestle with the pain of loving an abusive parent? How many people have to live with doing everything right and losing anyway?

Infinity 1 is a complete arc for Thanos. As its' protagonist he is able to experience everything that he wants in his story, but the beauty of what Marvel has built is that just like with Peter Quill in Guardians of the Galaxy, the story isn't finished in one movie. The story will have its continuation, and there will be a chance for the wrongs that you have enumerated to be put right.

Finally, hating something because of how other people like it is an absolutely justifiable thing. There are people that will never give Rick and Morty a chance because of how toxic their fandom can be, and there is no problem with that. But that makes it very difficult to love anything.

"I think your anger is understandable because yes some people are going to conflate Thanos' motive with ""love"". I don't actually think the Guardians are done any dirtier than Gunn did them (see his endless abuse of Mantis for apparent lols, and just generally how he chose to present her character). Quill is at the beginning of a realisation and journey to being mature, he and Gamora are at the start of a committed relationship but he still isn't quite ready to call it that; so he's beginning to grow up but so far this has been untested. It stars really with the introduction of Thor to the Guardians which is the first time Quill has to deal with potential competition - and he regresses a little. When Thanos says he likes him it's almost a hint that he recognises elements of himself in Quill.

Gamora cries after killing Thanos as much of relief and confusion over their relationship. And it's probably because now she thinks she at least has the space to examine it and it's harm. 

I think Thanos favoured Gamora because of his own narcissistic projection. So Nebula and Gamora to him represent the stronger and weaker elements of his own personality (btw, I know they aren't and are independent individuals manipulated by an abuser but he as an unreliable narrator presenting IW as his ""hero's journey"" chooses to perceive them this way). You can see his anger that it's Nebula who nearly defeats him and that's the real reason for his torture of her.

Gamora understanding her unwitting complicity in her sister's abuse, and that in unthinkingly trying to win Thanos' approval has become like him. That realisation is why she gives up the location of the soul stone. Thanos' torture of Nebula represents her complicity in his abuse and those hurt by him; Loki has the same moment when Thanos tortures Thor; Thanos likely manipulates that relationship because he understands it from his ""daughters"".

I think the film doesn't try to clear the lines up for the audience explicitly but it's there in Thanos' actions. Consider when he claims to know Scarlet Witch's pain when he patronisingly pats her on the head projecting his self image on her and a defensive decision she was pushed to *because of his behaviour*; then watch as the moment he reverses her action and she tries to stop him he bats her out of the way, showing who he really is because he truly cares about nothing but his erroneous quest. Consider how he disregards Vision, destroys him without thought, the reveal of his lack of care is in the way he tosses Vision's body away as if it was complete refuse and not a life.

It's in when he knocks out Captain America when we've heard Cap say one life is already too much and we know what he stands for - particularly when his own past conflict with Tony doesn't stop him from recognizing Tony is ""earth's best defender"" despite the mistakes he's made and the cost of those mistakes. Cap isn't petty and projecting but he's just as committed as Thanos, as his own narrator, claims to be.

The film presents the misinterpretation and trauma of being forced into a relationship with an abuser but it doesn't clarify that over common cultural misinterpretations and conflations made and excuses abusers commonly use to justify their abuse. So it is very much in danger of allowing a conflation of abuse with love but this is also an unreliable narrative told by a narcissistic abuser convinced of his own destiny and ""heroism"", and that is exactly the story he would tell to cover his evil and hold about his actions.

Also, it is part 1 of two - and while I don't believe part 2 will clear this up, I do feel I have to wait until the story is told in full to drop the boom. I have some complaints about IW that largely depend on how the concluding part goes - and some that don't.

IW suffers from Walter White syndrome, in which even though the writers established that Walter was driven by egotism and gave him outs (that he disregarded) to make that point; large parts of the audience still chose to view his actions as ""for his family"" and ultimately ""loving"".

In order to sell IW they've had to lie about Thanos' reliability as a narrator and sell him as a protagonist in order to make a cliffhanger resemble a complete one-shot. Sadly this plays directly into commonly social misconceptions of abusive behaviour, relationships, the outcome of sustained trauma and survival in such circumstances. This is problematic but largely dependent on whether you accept this finessing at face value or not.

The very fact that Thanos is destroying heroes and lives gives lie to her constructed "" heroism"". However it does give insight into his motivations and POV. If the ultimate end of his character is the ability to recognise his abusiveness and error that might be useful (if he is killed, not so much). If it is done through his daughters, Nebula in particular, those relationships and their conflations need to be clear.

It also needs to be shown that Thanos is merely ""rectifying"" the universe based on his anger over the death of Titan and his ""suggestions"" being unheeded is basically a manbaby throwing a tantrum over not being able to impose his will there. (It's also in the way he creayes his ""family"".) He has chosen to be trapped by his own early emotional experiences, and repeat them on a larger scale. Frankly his cull idea is dumb af and won't work long term but his choice of ""solution"" shows you who he really is. Someone who would use genocide as a first port of call over, say creating more resources, or establishing a galactic means of ensuring population growth can't exceed resources at any given time.

I have a lot more thoughts on this but this is already too long. 

I am really grateful to all the vidders out there who have called the abuse culture conflations in IW out, making that clear for viewers who either went along with the narrative framing device uncritically or unthinkingly, or those who just aren't familiar with abusive personalities, or the way abuse and trauma can cause survivors to respond by bonding with their captors until they are free from their abusers to process that harm.

I do think Thanos' actions speak louder than his fake rhetoric and it's there in the story of IW. The problem is how Avengers 4 chooses to close/respond to/question that set up because that can potentially undermine what was established in IW, rendering your worst fears of feeding abuse culture and the misinterpretation that allows abuse to go unchallenged.

Like I said, I have more thoughts on this but I'm just going to stop at that.",1,0,2018-09-02T13:16:34.000Z

These movies are as much for everyone as they always were, it's just that you don't happen to have had first hand experience of being in an explosion, losing an eye, having your parents murdered, or any number of other horrible things that have happened to people in this franchise before Infinity War.
With this in mind, the persistent reference to Iron man 1 being for everyone because the problem faced by Tony Stark is how will he get a burger, is borderline insulting. This is a movie that shows people in the middle east getting ambushed, shot, blown up; I wonder if everyone who fought in Afghanistan would agree with you that this was a movie for everyone.",1,0,2018-09-02T11:40:54.000Z

"I feel the premise of killing half the population won't fix all problems on it's own. For me it's similar to maybe Gundam Wing Endless Waltz, Inherently anti-war. Experiencing such tragedy first hand grants them the empathy and understanding to change their ways. Thanos is portrayed as completely insane and everything he does is wrong. And he's empathetic because it's one of the few films that portray the villain as a hero in his own story successfully.  For a large part of film history that was illegal. Like in the show Mindhunter, the serial killers are not to be praised but they are nonetheless extremely compelling and fascinating because they are so bizarre. 

  People think he's right because they are hopelessly supporting characters in their own stories. They feel hopeless and have no real agency to affect their story. They want to fix the world no matter the consequences. So they push for a protagonist who they feel can positively impact the social order by whatever means necessary. As long as the ends justify the means it's ok. 
 
 That's why people like Duterte, Putin, maybe Trump are so fervently embraced. These are horrible people who have no qualms about hurting people or killing their own citizens. But only they can make things better so it's worth it. But they're wrong. It takes more effort and hard work to do the right thing for the right reasons. But when good people do bad things they either have to invent a justification to live with themselves or they suffer real mental anguish for the rest of their lives. And some people are just crazy. 

  You see this with Vietnam Vets or other war veterans. Stories about people from WW One and Two. People who under normal circumstances would get along but because of life and the decisions of powerful people they will do everything possible to kill. I'd also add that Thanos has been pushing for this for the entire run of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And when we finally meet him and get to understand him everything about him is wrong. The loss of his planet and his people has broken him. And he's gone to such extremes in his own mental gymnastics that literally anything imaginable is justified for ""The Greater Good."" Thanos killing Gamora isn't sad because Thanos is sad. Thanos killing Gamora is sad because his warped mind justifies murdering someone he thinks he loves in order to save the universe.
 
  This theme for me is the best part of the movie and a good evolution of Civil War. We saw what the heroes actions did to themselves and how they deal with their trauma. But now the heroes are they innocent bystanders in some ways to the heroes journey of the protagonist of the story. Much in the same way Tony is confronted by someone in the beginning of Civil War by a victim of their actions. And Baron Zeemo is also a victim of their actions. In infinity War they are the victims of the actions of the protagonist. But this time we can't write it as collateral damage. Because to the victims of war or social unrest of inequality it's all unjust. 

  Violence is never noble or courageous. There are always casualties either in the present or the future. some people recognize that and say Thanos is evil. Some people reject that and say Thanos was right. No matter what actions you take there will always be a way to justify it to the right audience. Make the murder palatable and you can justify any crime. No matter how horrific.",0,0,2018-09-02T11:26:54.000Z

"Hmmm, i think if i had seen this video immediately after seeing the movie, I would have very much agreed with you. However, after having seen the movie several times now, and talking about it with others, I see the whole Thanos and Gamora thing a bit differently.

My first thought when he killed her and got the stone was something along the lines of ""really? we're gonna go that route? there's no fucking way whatever he ""feels"" equates to love."" And i hated that part of the movie because i felt it was completely unnecessary. I suppose this hatred came from the fact that the film was really nothing like how i expected it to be. I didn't think we'd get such an in-depth look at Thanos, his reasonings for collecting the infinity stones and what motivated him to pursue this path. I expected our usual cliche bad guy, he wants to destroy the world because he hates it. Given the lack of development for Thanos in all the previous movies, I figured this assumption would be correct. 

Now I really love Gamora as a character, the Guardians of the Galaxy movies are by far my absolute favorite ones out of all the Marvel movies. So her death only further infuriated me. It made no sense, how could Thanos possibly love her? How could the movie possibly justify his love for her by rewarding him with the stone? 

And so I rewatched it and continued to think it over. No, the movie doesn't justify it. There are people in this world who truly believe their sick perversion of love is just as real as the love Thanos has for Gamora. We, the viewer, are disgusted by this notion because we understand that is not a healthy kind of love. What Thanos did to Nebula and Gamora was pure evil, the only reason he had them by his side was because he destroyed half of their people, enslaved them, forced them to do his bidding, and tortured them if they refused. The characters never justify Thanos's logic, it is the one thing they can all agree on: Thanos is a madman. His black and white logic is perverted by the experiences he had on his home plane. He believes his plan would have worked because he forcibly implemented it on other planets to ""save"" them.

Yes, Thanos does receive the Soul stone as a result of sacrificing Gamora, and so what? It doesn't mean abuse=love, it simply means that what Thanos felt was what he thought love was. It merely fuels our hatred for this monster. If anything, I wish the movie had expanded upon this love he had for Gamora, and shown more elements of grief he felt over causing her death. 

But either way, that's just my thoughts on that. I respect your opinion Mikey and can't wait to see more from you!",0,0,2018-09-02T11:10:41.000Z
"Usually, I can't help but find these videos deep and insightful, helping me to understand the movies they each cover in a totally new light, giving me a deeper understanding of why I love the movie. However, this one just struck me as... misinformed.

Before I say why, I just want to point out that I grew up in an abusive household. I won't delve to deeply into it, but it was bad. I tried (and failed) to escape many times. I still remember the feeling of going to sleep with the hopes that I wouldn't wake up in the morning. With that said...

I don't see Thanos as an abuser. I see him as a killer. Sure, he tortured people, but usually ended up killing them off. He only kept Nebula in that state so he could find the Soul Stone, which worked. To me, that was just Typical Bad Guy 101. If Nebula wasn't his daughter, but, say, Gamora's best ally/friend/whatever, that scene would still have played the same.

Now, did Thanos actually love Gamora? I would say so. Up until Red Skull, it was completely clear that Thanos would let Gamora get away with anything. She could yell at him, tell him she hates him, punch him, etc. and he wouldn't even try to stop her. Anyone else, anyone at all, would have been torn to pieces for so much as thinking about trying any of those things. But with Gamora, Thanos would just sigh and let it continue.

Going a bit further, when she stabbed the illusion of Thanos and cried, I didn't take it as ""oh no, I still love hom, why did I do that?"". I interpreted it more as her finally letting go of decades worth of hatred in a single cathartic moment. Trust me, when you see someone you hate in pain, your body just reacts on its own. Especially when you have carried that hate for years and years.

Lastly, I never considered Thanos the protagonist of Infinity War. That never occurred to me, nor does it now that I've seen this. A main character, sure, but the whole movie makes it very clear that what he's doing is very wrong. I feel that if any one character is the central protagonist, it's Thor. He has the most screen time of all the hero characters, he had the most complete arc of them and he was right the whole time. No, really, think about it: if the Guardians had all followed him to Nidavellir instead of splitting up so half the team could go to Knowhere, then Gamora would never have been captured, Thanos would never have found the Soul Stone and he would have had to fight both the Avengers AND the Guardians of the Galaxy on Earth with an incomplete gauntlet.

I hope that whoever reads this doesn't think that I'm mad about this video. I'm not. I just feel that my unique perspective on abuse can offer a contradiction to the message in a way that isn't hostile.

P.S. Sorry for the rant.",3,0,2018-09-02T10:44:52.000Z
"@FilmJoy, honestly the 1st time I've been disappointed at the research and conversation presented on this topic. Abuse does not equal love and abusers are not binary beings. Sympathy with Thanos goes so far as he is the last being of his kind after watching his people die, full stop. Empathetic in so far as to examine why someone who is viewed as a monster came to his conclusions on life and how to treat others. Empathy does not equal condoning. An abuser given some humanity is a starting place for a conversation about what is happening, how to stop it, and to understand that just because someone loves another, does not mean they are correct in the manner with which they treat those they abuse. I would greatly appreciate a response because I feel the mark was missed in interpreting this plot line. I feel this interpretation drives this conversation to a place that is not conducive to resolution, but more divisiveness.

"I liked this video for the honesty and clarity of the opinion, and how respectfully it was delivered. Of course, I still disagree with a couple points, and here is why:

First off, I don't think Thanos is a bad or unsympathetic villain, just one whose train of that resembles that of a religious fanatic. He is not rational, and he is singular in purpose. Not only that, but he is so committed that he is willing to sacrifice the only thing he (believes that he) loves. He believes he is working for the higher power that is ""balance"", and has a divine right to decide if people live or die. While other people might not come to the same conclusions, it is understandable how a person pushed to the brink of despair could cling to a perceived greater purpose. The difference is that he would be the self-deluded cult-leader, instead of just a random cultist. That's still an understandably human situation to sympathize with.

Second, I believe the tonal issues were not a fault of the movie, but of the marketing. I believe it was important to have a summer blockbuster be as dark as this, and I personally loved it. I left the theater with a huge grin on my face, happy to see a satisfying unhappy ending. Obviously lots of people weren't ready, and parents took their kids expecting to see a fun summer romp. This was a failure of marketing, and of not warning people what they were signing up for.

I also generally feel that (from the parental point of view) the split between love and abuse is a false dichotomy, but that is too much to discuss for this YouTube comment. Note: I'm not saying Thanos is not abusive, I'm saying that the premise of presenting the feeling of love and abuse as completely incompatible is a false one.",0,0,2018-09-02T08:50:36.000Z

"I love Movies with Mikey, pretty much every episode is absolute gold and I very rarely disagree with anything he says. This one however has me conflicted, for me hes missed a point. Thanos is the villain we face in the really real world right now (not literally obviously). Someone who is doing something utterly nonsensical, evidence easily shows his plans and theory's are utter bobbins but by sheer conviction he ignores all evidence. Despite his obvious villainy he sees himself as the hero. If that doesnt bring anyone in the real world to mind then....maybe your not paying enough attention. People follow conviction, they will ignore reality and live in their blind little bubbles ignoring all evidence thats real and thats an important message and point.

I think sometimes film should reflect the reality that villains sometimes....no often win at least in the short term. I think personally that we have all gotten very complacent about things happening in the real world, we assume things will get better, that we can push back the dark while sticking to all our high minded principals and Im not sure thats true.

The abuse issue in particular between Thanos and Gomora yeah its uncomfortable but it felt real, it very much mirrored my own personal experiences.  I dont think it was played cheaply.  The fact that people feel sympathy for and even agree with Thanos says something about the nature of society not the nature of the film.

No argument from me that this film is brutal and deeply uncomfortable but Im not sure I agree that Marvel shouldn't have made a brutal and uncomfortable film. Stories that make us sad and angry have just as much value as ones that make us happy.",2,0,2018-09-02T07:55:58.000Z
"Peronally, I see Thanos in this movie as Disney's big purple alien counterpart to their portrayal of Claude Frollo; abusive, sadistic, yet constantly trying to convince himself and his peers that everything he does is justified by his limited understanding of what compassion even is.

"Enjoyed your perspective even if I disagree. You’ve given me a lot to talk about.

1) your first point on the tone is kind of disagreeable to me. Infinity War didn’t invent dark storytelling nor is it the first comic book movie to delve into dark topics. Dark Knight, Logan. Both those films are praised, and it’s dark tone helps and supports its themes. That is exactly the case with Infinity War. It’s a movie about failure, loss, different ideas of fatherhood. The dark tone helps. I personally believe that whatever tone you use should be ok as long as it advanced the quality. People who say that Marvel films are for little babies because they have jokes are nonsensical. For me, light heartedness and dark tones do not hinder a film from achieving good storytelling. It only depends on the theme and how it fits in. 

And the film doesn’t ‘yield trauma like a circus act’. Those traumatic moments were plot points. Things that happened that were dark that were part of the story. It IS a dark story and dark things will happen. Do you want them to have bright happy moments like every other film before it? It puzzles me that now, after 17 films of light heartedness and people hating on Marvel for being ‘kiddy popcorn flicks’, people are now criticizing them from being too dark. A change in tone is welcome, actually. This keeps the superhero genre alive. 

And that next point about how Thanos’ ideology is accepted as ‘truth’ is wrong, and very easily disproven. He’s literally called the mad Titan, and no one is on his side, except the people he brainwashed. 

Then you go on to talk about reckless filmmaking and how they equate abuse to love. The film very clearly says that Thanos’ feelings are not love. Yes the soul stone grants itself to him, but Red Skull very clearly says “sacrifice that which you love.” That which YOU love. It depended on Thanos’ view on love. His love is twisted and sick and absolutely not healthy love, but in his eyes it was love. Killing Gamora was loss for him. For HIM. That’s why the soul stone was given but it doesn’t mean that the film equates abuse to love. His version of love is established as wrong. “This isn’t love”, Gamora says. The movie literally tells us that Thanos’ idea of love is wrong and unhealthy. And the idea of films directly having to comply with feelings of some of its audience doesn’t sit well with me. This is film. This is art. This isn’t a PSA. Yes, things still have to be handled properly and healthily, but just because it’s a sensitive topic doesn’t mean they shouldn’t tackle it at all. Portrayal itself isn’t immediately reckless. There are factors. As I said, they tackle abuse and twisted versions of love, but they handle it in a way that shows it to be wrong.

2.) The GOTG not being handled properly is subjective. I thought they were handled pretty well. And btw James Gunn did help write their scenes. As for Quill, it is still a part of his character to be a man child. He’s established as a bit of a jerk who doesn’t think things through. How was he responsible for Gamora’s death? Because he didn’t pull the trigger? It’s IN HIS CHARACTERIZATION to be a jerk. Just because he killed his parent doesn’t mean he isn’t going to have childish tendencies forever. 

And I’m confused here. You seem to support James Gunn, who has a cloudy past (tons of pedophilia jokes, pedophilia themed party, friendship with a convicted pedophile) and yet dislike Infinity War for tackling abusive issues? 

And let’s talk about GOTG VOL2, which IMO if you’re going to chew IW out for abuse=love, then why not bring up how Yondu, a guy clearly abusive, was portrayed as a hero and even got a big death scene where the abused person cries over him?

Then Gamora, who you say was used to create stakes. Literally everything is used to create stakes so I don’t know what you’re talking about. When anyone or anything is in trouble, that creates stakes. When New York was in trouble? All those lives were ‘stakes’. When Hawkeye left to save a boy in Sokovia, that boy was ‘stakes’. Anytime a person is in danger, that is considered stakes. And again, this movie does not say that abuse=Love. That scene proves that Thanos believed he loves her, not that he loves her in a healthy way. It’s a dramatic, well written, well shot scene, and you’re criticizing it on how ‘unhealthy’ it is. A deeper analysis reveals that no, they do NOT equate love and abuse. To say that “Thanos got the soul stone by sacrificing his daughter. That must CLEARLY be a portrayal of how abuse=Love!” Is looking at it very bare. And looking at her crying over him as “she cries therefore she loves him! Which is them condoning abusive relationships!” Is also very bare and a very simplistic way of looking at it. Hate to tell you, but LOVE IS COMPLICATED. There is no one definition of love, nor is love limited by conventional versions. Love is healthy, unhealthy, simple, complex, obvious, ambiguous, etc. An abused person CAN care about their abuser and an abuser CAN feel emotions (unhealthy ones) towards their victim. Love isn’t exclusive to those who practice it healthily. She cried for him because she was forced to kill someone who raised her, whether or not in an unhealthy environment. She knows she has to and she doesn’t hesitate to. But that doesn’t mean she feels NOTHING. It’s not plausible to not feel something for someone who raises you and shows care for you. Thanos cared for her only, and that kind of care can get to you. Her crying over him actually portrays it in a very complex manner. They can’t portray everything in black and white.

Thanos is a monster, not necessarily just “mentally ill”. We forget but some people are just bad. Doesn’t have to be more complicated than that. If we have to watch out for every little nuance that could be misconstrued, then I say don’t bother making movies anymore.

The tone of the movie is set because the stakes have never been higher, and it works all the way up to the crescendo right before the end, the satisfaction of Thor having his victory... and then taken away. It’s supposed to evoke a different emotion. Its like the comic books themselves, they don’t always end on high notes. We’ve entered into cinema that transcends the standards. Its a sweeping narrative (albeit held back by telling single cohesive narratives in the span of two hours). This stuff would probably feel better told over longer periods of time, but it is what it is.

While the movie is showing that the abuser is capable of love, it is in no way glorifying or even accepting of the abuse. The abuse is clearly shown as wrong and even grotesque. I agree with the mental health points you made and about quill regressing back to the first film but honestly this happens to at least one character in every avengers movie. Lastly, I really don't think that judging this movie on its own is truly fair - this is meant to be a 2 part story. Just like you said in the video for Last Jedi - let's wait for the 3rd movie to make final judgements and see if we get the Empire feels for it.

"I almost always 💕 your perspectives on things. Can't say I agree with everything here, but this video and opinion was very well put together. I WILL say you are SPOT ON about the abuse issues. But you really came off as one of those people who just ... seems to like having everything to wrapped up in a nice, pretty bow ... where things end up all puppies and kittens and happy endings. That OBVIOUSLY just isn't how the world outside your door exists. Why would a dark movie (where everyone already knows walking in that there is going to be heavy, heavy subject matter and consequences) be any different?

Parents should really read the comics (all of them, because ... they can get pretty dark). Parents should also read the comics, or at the very least Google them, if they are so concerned about what their children might be seeing. A good majority of ALL the comics have abuse in one form or another, especially of women and children. I have to think that people are just super naive or super stupid to think it is magically going to be better because it is a freakin' MARVEL movie. Thanos clearly suffers from sociopathy (among other conditions). Trauma and making people suffer is his MO. It shouldn't have been dismissed the way it was, but, again, COMICS.

"Here's the thing for me...
The whole movie felt pointless.  Do not misunderstand me.  I liked it well enough.  It was funny at times & heartbreaking too.  But through the whole movie, from the very start, I kept thinking that Thanos was just playing with everyone.  He was so powerful.  Halfway through he was travelling intergalactically without a spaceship.  The Children of Thanos were basically useless.  Did they ever accomplish anything of importance bc they couldn't handle getting a couple stones from some humans & an AI?  He wrapped the whole thing up in like, what, a day?! 

I get it was his movie.  I am good with suspension of disbelief, hell this is a comic book movie.  But going in buying in 110% to the concept, I just kept feeling pissed off that they expected me to believe Thanos would've wasted any time bothering with any of them.  The only one actually powerful enough to defeat him was Thor.  And I struggle to believe Thor wouldn't have just killed him dead, period.  I just don't buy it.

I hope like heck A4 redeems it all & wraps it up nicely.  I kind of think it would've been way more interesting to have Thanos win easily & then spend the rest of it showing the Avengers figuring out how to defeat him.  Maybe that's just me & I haven't read the comics so I don't know how it actually went down.  Anyhoo, just my $0.02, for whatever it is worth.",1,0,2018-09-02T02:16:09.000Z
"I agree with all the comments saying that abuse is not equal to love. That and the Starlord issue about saying he was the same person he was at the start of the movie is just false. He cried at the death of his mother and Yandu, but when Ego said he killed his mom he reacted violently, THE SAME WAY HE DID WITH THANOS. Peter Quill's arc is not over, there is a Guardians Vol. 3 for a reason",31,1,2018-09-02T02:08:48.000Z
"So, here's a crazy though, you may even call it a *mad* one: If you got out of Infinity War thinking Thanos was right, then you're wrong just like him, and he won, by making you think like him. Now if you got out of Infinity War pissed the hell off that he got it his way and hopping the heroes fix his mess on the next one, then he lost. It took me some to wrap my head around this but here's what I came up with: Movies, if you let them, help you find your own truths and values. You can think the movie was right or wrong, and that tells you something about yourself that maybe you didn't know before.

I was devastated coming out of the theater and even a pair of days after, and guess why? Better yet, don't guess, 'cause I'll tell you. I was deeply sad because I conformed with it. Spider-Man dies at age 16, life's ruthless, crazy fucks get what they want while I watch helplessly. But that's just the way it is, right? Always have, always will. After giving it some thought I came to the conclusion that no, it doesn't have to be like that, and it won't be like that. The story isn't over yet. Cap wasn't wrong, Thanos wasn't right, and this made up story showed me something about myself that I didn't know before: Don't compromise in the face of evil, don't let sweet little lies turn you into something ugly, don't become that which you are up against.

"You know something. I feel like this was a public service you did here. I never considered this, once. I never empathised with Thanos but assumed some idiots might. But the moment you hit me with the kid in the theatre next the to the abusive parent I felt a cold shiver up my spine. It broke me. It's a hard thing to swallow. But this video shone a little light on a very important problem with the film. It's funny how thinking differently is so feared even when it's about protecting undeveloped minds from believing that their abuser loves them. Even if the abuser assumes they do, it isn't love. You clearly love this film and have only addressed the point. Feels often like people cannot accept that something is flawed without it taking away from the whole experience. Even Empire had its moments. But the message in this film is a very putrid one. Even the thing with Peter everyone had to find a justification for what he did, saying how he was always impulsive but contextually speaking, what reason would he have for not shooting Ego? Makes no sense, the guy killed his mother. But this scene with Thanos...he would've been able to kill him anyways. One scene shows he's emotional, the shows he irrational. There's a major difference. I agree with Mike everyone should, he's on point. But you and anyone can still love the movie. But keeping in mind that every Marvel film can be watched without context and enjoyed, this movie needs the other movies to be entertaining, otherwise it's a twisted story about an abuser learning to abuse better and that we should feel sorry for him. Kind of messed up. 

I loved this video, it's never easy to say something unpopular but you said it so well I can't even be mad. I rolled my eyes at every Thanos was right video I saw. Life if unchecked may cease but life is not a thing you can break down to numbers. We're not even the first major species to live and then go extinct. Many species have come and gone. Humans may one day perish but we also might, Ghamorra said that Thanos may not know that and she's right. Anyone who actually thinks Thanos makes sense it's really just shouting in the dark. Life is complex so either you must evolve you mind to understand it or you take no part in deciding it's fate. There is no simple solution to anything. Culling humans it's just plain fucked up, simple as. Also why the fuck was James Gunn fired!? Jesus this is another wierd year...not as bad as last year but more hollow and miserable.

"I agree that this is only recognizable as an Avengers movie by the faces and costumes. I also agree with the ""It's not a narrative and an event"". But I have some disagreements. What I like about this movie and the character Thanos is how he presumably saw his world starve to death (I'm guessing it ended with him eating the other guy), then he takes it upon himself to save the universe from the same fate (there are animal populations that eat themselves out of a food source). The solution he comes up with shows us he's not too bright, maybe he thinks he buying more time for a future plan. He clearly feels no remorse for harming people, so he's probably a sociopath. 

I think the great thing about Thanos is that he's absolutely a monster who is capable of love, and that's also important. He's the bad guy, he's the monster who has to be stopped, and he can feel love. I wonder how many terrible people there are out there who think ""I'm not really a bad guy, I love people."" This is a movie that shows bad people that yeah they're really bad/you have a villain in you.

To love is human, to be abusive is also human, and both can happen in the same person at the same time, and I think dealing with that rather than sweeping it under the rug will better prepare people who are convinced their abuser loves them. Because to them it might be true, and they have to deal with that.

"Yeah, I am going to have to agree with you that Thanos was made out to be not only sympathetic but the film never pointed out how wrong he was on his plans/logic.

No matter how much of the sads Thanos is shown having he is still a kidnapper, a child abuser, a mass murder, and man who committed genocide and will never get my sympathy. I can understand why a character would do something but they never bothered with connecting on why Thanos thinks and/or made the logic jump from, ""my planet is overpopulated and we have to half our population"" to "" the entire universe is overpopulated and must be cut in half"".

 I also agree that  having Quill punch Thanos in the face, as just blind rage pretty much overrides any character growth he had in the past two Guardian films a honestly I can't belive that people are definding both characters' actions in the films to this day.",1,0,2018-09-02T00:38:29.000Z

It expertly shows how an abusive relationship works. It may be a sick love, but thanos loved gammora and sadly she also cared for him. And your criticism of the guardians is strange.

"You people clearly have this romanticized version of love that doesn't allow for nuance. Despite your ability to dissect so much of the content and show why it is all so revolting, you are too blinded by an idealized form of love that trumps all and that's fine, for filmmaking it's perfectly fine to put that idea in everyone's minds. That's what films are good for, removing people from the darker reality they're in or mending that reality by giving the person hope, as well as the other seemingly lesser (although just as important to me) entertainment value.

But love isn't all puppies and rainbows. Obsessive love, whether you agree or not, is love. It's the kind of love people should avoid. It's toxic and doesn't do any good, but it's love. You can be abused by someone and love them, like Gamora was with Thanos. Stockholm syndrome can come about because you get twisted up inside, become too familiar with someone or otherwise lose who you are as a person because of what someone has done to you, turned you into.

And I think the whole point of this movie is something to that effect. It's to show you that sometimes things are hopeless. Sometimes the good guys don't win. There is no moral responsibility for a filmmaker to make children of all ages feel good about their situation. Abuse is horrible and it's a pity that any child could ever potentially watch this film and get that message, but need I remind you that this is clearly and blatantly a two-part story. There is another film coming to bring back all of the hope that was lost, likely bringing back many if not all characters who were lost previously and showing the flaws of Thanos' beliefs.

But to say that you can't love an abuser and an abuser can't love those they abuse is absolutely and objectively wrong.

I know it's wrong.

And Thanos isn't insane, you're right.

But he HAS created an identity around being the anti-martyr. He thinks the ends justify the means, something that CAN be empathetic, especially if you push it down to a smaller perspective.

If you cut the rapist's penis off he can't rape anyone again, but you're torturing a human. Many would cheer for that tho.

If you kill a bunch of people, the starvation stops (briefly). That CAN be empathetic in the same way people sympathise with mass murderers like school shooters. They shot up schools because, most likely, they have mental health problems that went unchecked and could have been saved. You hate them. You despise what they did.

About your math section. Planets on the brink of collapse would benefit from the load being taken off of them and would have TIME to improve their infastracture. Sure it wouldn't be long before they got to the same population level but if they were smart they would use that time of resource abundance to prepare for it and not encounter the same problem. The issue isnt that the gas is running out and there is no alternative. the issue is that they cant/wont switch to clean energy fast enough to prevent collapse. But now they have time. the burden is lifted and the resources more abundant than ever. They can imporve and in their improved state possible prevent the snap from being necessary for a much longer time than 4000 years. So the math is jusyt wrong because you assume that NOTHING about the society or their technology would change.

I don't even *have* abuse or similar trauma in my background, and the whole part where the movie goes out of its way to linger on how saaaaaaad Thanos is about *literally murdering the child he kidnapped* squicked me out super hard. I'm fine with the concept of Thanos believing himself to be in the right. I'm fine for him to have convinced himself that his murderous instincts are noble, even altruistic. I'm fine that he might consider himself to have made such a heroic sacrifice by *literally murdering the child he kidnapped.* He is a bad person with a bad world view. He's going to believe bad things. Fine.

But I was *not* fine with how the movie did not challenge him on that. It didn't portray any of that as truly evil or abhorrent, because it was too busy trying to get us to empathize with him. And I'm sorry, but nope. Nope nope nope. I don't care how many sadfeels he's having about his supposed burden of responsibility to supposedly save a universe that hates him; he is literally the worst mass murderer ever, and an abusive, scary parent, and therefore his sadfeels are trivial compared to the destruction he's wreaking. Whatever internal turmoil he's in is his own freaking fault. He doesn't need a hug; he needs to be opposed.

Make us understand Thanos' point of view, fine. But there's no way this movie should be trying to make us empathize with him.

Fridging Gamora could have been somewhat salvaged if it didn't work. Like, he ""sacrifices"" her, and whatever mystic forces of the universe in charge of that place don't respond to it, because he doesn't love her. That would have been the movie giving him pushback. But as it happened, *Gamora* told him that their relationship wasn't really love, but the mystic forces of the universe sided with *Thanos*.

"The whole thing about Gamora weeping over killing Thanos... in my family, my wider family I mean, there have been abusive parents, and even so the kids and parents loved each other. It's wrong and messed up and makes no sense, but there you have it. I mean listen to Boogie's story about his mother who was an awful monstrous woman, even after everything he still loved her.
Sometimes, actually often, parents will do abusive or borderline abusive things because they think it's the right thing to do, it's hard to find people that don't have such parents and this idea that we shouldn't depict such relationships because it might be upsetting to some is... puritanical, honestly. It's like how in the US words that allude to violence are censored in songs even though acts of violence are a frequent reality. It's also offensive to the intelligence of general audiences, I can't think of a great film that didn't challenge intellectually me as a viewer or made me uncomfortable emotionally, infact a film has to do that for me to be able to call it great. Not saying Infinity War is great, I'm saying fuck compromising ideas for the sake of audience's feelings, even if those ideas aren't good and creative risks don't pay of. You see all this discussion we're having and analyzing ourselves and society in reaction to this film?

The perfect villain, in other words.

I just wish they'd gotten his characterization right by _literally any other route_ because we don't _need_ more people mistaking ""this character has a backstory"" for ""this character is sympathetic"" since that can also be read as ""this character's _hilariously_ toxic views are acceptable in polite society"" _and yet here we are._

"I agree with pretty much everything you said, and I think the point about Thanos' motivation making no sense stands out as by far the worst problem, from a storytelling perspective. By buying into Thanos' insanity, the writers/filmmakers implicitly justify and excuse everything else he does. They're presenting him as, essentially, *being right*, which raises the question of why any of the other characters should even oppose him. 

It's also bad for Thanos as a character because for all the crying and smiling and yelling and emoting he does, we never get any idea what makes him tic. Why did he think a 50% culling would help a famine in the first place? You don't come up with an idea like that for impersonal reasons, but the movie never goes into it. Thanos is at heart a black box, doing things because the story needs him to.

Now they don't so people have fewer kids.  If you halved the population in a stable ""developed"" country, it'd probably stabilize at around that population.

Also, about what you said about thanos and gamora and kids of abusers, those kids are *already* learning that abuse = love, this movie doesn't change that.  However, what this movie (this *pg-13* movie, I might add) DOES do, is give these kids a context for their abusive relationship.  Thanos is evil and kills not only most of our favorite super heroes, but gamora as well.  If the abused kid sees that, then he/she might realize their relationship with their abuser doesn't end well and it might drive them to find a way out.  However, if you make a movie about an abuser that doesn't care at all about his victim, then you actually alienate these abused kids because guess what, a lot of abused kids actually love their abuser and think they are loved back so they wouldn't see their relationship in that hypothetical show",1,0,2018-09-01T19:56:39.000Z

"I fundamentally agree with everything you're saying, but I also think that a point to touch on is that the context of these choices is essential: Thanos is the embodiment of the reckless idea that a single perfect answer exists. I think this is a frustration that everyone wrestles with at some point: if only the antagonising force in your life could be defeated (in the context of superhero films, punched until it goes away) and it is here presented as the *most* awful thing in the shape of Thanos - i think it's ironic that the superhero formula often sets a precedent for that frustration, which is usually unaddressed and is here presented as the greatest threat ever. I think the flaw in presenting this subtext is that this is a blockbuster film that doesn't lay that out absolutely clearly for everyone to understand (it's shakily presented subtext, at most), so where Thanos is clearly a villain, his ideas aren't laid out as villainous: it isn't clear that it is his ideals that are wrong and not just his actions in pursuit of those ideals. Marvel movies should (by their own precedent) be for everyone, and rather than make a shaky subtext into text for everyone to understand, this film surely has a great many people relating to/empathising with/being uncomfortably familiar with an abusive man doing despicable things to the people that he believes he cares about in pursuit of what the text implies to be ""good reasons"". I personally found that the revelation that he cares for Gamora was essential to sell the idea that he really believes he's being selfless, that he would give anything for his ideals because he believes they're right - the idea that he really does think that everything he is doing is justified, that all of his actions can be excused. But outside of the plot (this happens so this happens so this happens, etc.), it's an unaddressed thing that maybe for many kids is going to be a touchstone for understanding why abusive people are abusive: *because* they care. That's sure what it looks like, and this is not challenged, this is not presented as otherwise, and that seems pretty thoughtless - maybe some people will think that point isn't very valid, and I'm not sure how much impact it realistically would have, but it's something that can't be easily dismissed and can be easily addressed. And it just isn't. I just don't understand why Thanos isn't unquestionably shaken down within the text of the film as an abusive man clinging to foolish beliefs at the expense of everyone around him, a man who can be understood through empathy, but who should not be cared for or excused through that empathy, and whose beliefs are fundamentally *wrong*. As the film goes on, it's not as critical of him as I think it ought to be. So why is he not shown to be wrong, that his actions are unjust? It wouldn't make him any less threatening, and Thanos surely wouldn't question himself, but it seems like something essential that this film forgets (or worse, never chooses) to do. It seems like the film excuses Thanos (even though yes it very clearly shows us that he's a bad guy) because it never stops to tell us that he is absolutely definitely wrong.

"Il get straight to the point, this videos, at least temporarily changed my view on Infinity war, and in a way on movies in general. I had never really stopped to consider the effect that misrepresenting abuse, trauma, and psychological disorders could have. Which kinda bummed me out because I really, really liked this movie. Now I'm sure that I, with my amazing ability to bury all negative emotions under the bed, will eventually learn to love the movie again. However, for now, I can't do that. I first began writing a comment about how Thanos believed what he felt was love, which either was enough or was something that would come back to haunt him later (aka a possible way to get people back or something). And how Gamora was probably feeling relief, and not happiness. But you made me realize that no matter how you put it unless it is clearly stated, and even then, many won't catch on to it. I have been blessed with a life that has never caused me great harm. I have had people close to me die, I haven't got the best physical health, I'm not quite smart enough to do all the things I want to do with my life, but compared to others my life is a walk on roses. I have never had to walk out of a movie because it reminded me of tough times. I have never been forced to live with an abusive parent. I have never had any struggle beyond my own small imperfection. So as you say, the movie is still an impressive feat of art considering the journey it took to get there. And like I said, I will probably be able to love it again at some point.

"Honestly, this has got to be the first time I disagree with you on a film. Generally, I find that your analysis of a film tends to make me appreciate it more, but this time, I can't help but feel like you let the fact that the movie upset you get in the way of analyzing it. A few things you said never gelled with me, and that was surprising coming from someone who, from what I've seen, is generally able to see more layers to films than I ever am.

Other comments have said it far better than I could manage without an hour or two of framing my words better, but you're equating Thanos being an empathetic character with Thanos being a sympathetic character. Empathy is understanding why someone does something, but sympathy is agreeing with that person. In the clips you showed us from different interviews, the people involved with the film called Thanos empathetic, but at the end of your video you said that he was supposed to be sympathetic, and I think you're fundamentally wrong there. Empathy != Sympathy, and I think you let yourself get mad at the filmmakers because you are mad at Thanos (rightfully so). Just because Thanos won, however, doesn't mean he was right.

I think Thanos genuinely did love Gamora, but that doesn't mean that he's not a broken person who abuses everyone around him, it just means that he's a broken person who abuses everyone around him including the one person whom he loved.

I don't think Thanos is evil because he's ""comic book insane,"" I think he's evil because he firmly and unshakingly believes he is right. That is far more terrifying than Thanos in the comics because there are people like that in real life. People exist that no longer allow their opinions to change no matter the evidence presented to them because they believe they are right. You don't have to look further than the US house of representatives to see that.

And poor Peter Quill. I think out of any of the characters in the film, he was written as the most human. Yes, he regressed slightly, but can you blame him? He had just had the wound of losing his mother reopened by finding out that his father was the one who killed her, had to kill his own father, and then lost his surrogate father doing just that. He did what Gamora asked and pulled the trigger to kill her instead of letting her be kidnapped, only for it not to work and Thanos to show that Peter had no chance of ever stopping him. Then to top it all off, he tracks Thanos down and does everything right to save Gamora, only to find out he was too late. Thanos killed her and had the gall to feel bad about it. For the third time in his life, Peter had the person closest to him torn away, and he could do nothing about it. I don't blame him for lashing out at the person who caused it.

And the last thing I'm going to say. Yes, the ending was supposed to be shocking, but that doesn't mean that it was only for shock value. I don't think any of the deaths were just for shock value, they were meant to make us feel like the surviving characters. T'challa dying shocked us, but it also left us frightened, and Bucky's death only cemented this. Scarlet witch dying felt quiet and resigned because that's how she felt after Vision died. Groot dying left us empty because that was how Rocket felt after losing what was essentially the other half of his dynamic duo. We saw how Peter felt empty as well as the last of his friends started dying, only to be followed by himself. Doctor Strange died resolved because he knew this had to happen, but apologetic because he knew what it would do to Tony. And when Peter Parker died, we saw Tony finally succumb to the darkness that he had been fighting against since just after the first Avengers. Nothing Tony did could do anything to stop what he had always feared. And the one person who had made Tony feel hopeful again after so much had gone wrong for him just died in his arms, begging for help that he couldn't even hope to give. The ending was dark, but it wasn't just to be dark, it was to make us feel like the few people who were left alive.",1,0,2018-09-01T19:10:43.000Z

"So our supervillain should not be marked down as mad because he doesn't fit the clinical definition of insanity? And therefore the writing is bad because he's not actually insane and his plan doesn't make any sense. But why is it necessary that he fit the real-world definition of madness? Because it would make a better message?
And as far as the abuse goes, I can see where you're coming from. But Thanos only needed to believe he loves Gamora, which he does believe. And abusive people thinking they love the ones they hurt isn't a strange idea. Gamora literally calls it out, ""This isn't love."" The film could definitely send a better message, but I don't believe the film is under any obligation to send a good message in the first place.

Also, I don't care what the writers say, Thanos is not the protagonist. He is a central character with a stated goal, this does not make him a protagonist. Especially when we have other characters with stated goals who are also central to the film.

Having a stated goal and struggling to achieve that doesn't make a protagonist, it just makes a decent character. The morality of the protagonist is besides the point as well. The only thing that defines the protagonist is the perspective of the struggle. If we spend a whole story following the struggles of a baby-eating monster as they try to eat all the babies in the world, the monster would still be the protagonist because it's his struggles we watch. We don't watch Thanos' struggles. We see him in conflict, but only ever in relation to the Avengers. Whereas the Avengers have conflict even when Thanos is not on the screen. Outside of the final shot I don't believe there's a single scene where Thanos exists and an Avenger doesn't.

Also, your line about Arkham Asylum not rehabilitating is completely wrong. One of the most famous story arcs of Batman shows that they try to rehabilitate people and it unfortunately doesn't always work. Two Face was given a die and a deck of cards to help him make more varied decisions with the aim of introducing free choice back to him, but it backfired into just making him rely on them more. Joker is shown to be untreatable due to him reinventing himself constantly. Even outside this story, some of the villains are rehabilitated.

And the movie isn't trying to say that either. We can't just shy away from certain topics in movies. We can't just pretend that everything is sunshine and rainbows 100% of the time. Hell even Civil War had the awful deaths of children and families in Sokovia, as well as those that Wanda accidentally got killed in the Wakandan place. I'm sure that would trigger a response from people with similar experiences too. What's the difference?

Thanos is a really really bad dude. The movie wasn't made to show what Thanos was doing as the good thing, him throwing Gamora off a cliff is absolutely awful and no one would've seen it differently. It sounds as though you believe Thanos is being given the 'heroes pedestal', like every single thing he does (like in the aforementioned case of Captain America) is completely justified and right. Whilst I can't speak for your personal experiences and pains, I don't think this movie presented things in the ways that you can see them. And Thanos isn't 'mentally ill', he's just a dude who thinks he's right.

In the case of Quill. The clip you showed of him shooting his father was out of sheer mourning for his mother. He was enraged. The exact same thing happened when he realised Gamora was dead. Mourning will drive people to do crazy things. When he was approaching Thanos in Knowhere with the team, he tried to keep them all to a structured plan, showing that he'd moved on from his hothead attitude from the first movie. I think you're sort of misjudging this movie. But hey, to each his own.",4,0,2018-09-01T15:51:46.000Z

"8:30 but movies aren't supposed to teach children. They don't have to have a message. By this logic, the bad guy is never allowed to win in a movie because that teaches kids that being evil is profitable or can work. Everything Great About Infinity War pt1 said it really well when he said we're not meant to empathize with thanos. The torture and suffering we see in the movie is meant to show how much he doesn't care about his children. He had them fight until one of them was more robot than human. Isn't this movie PG-13?

While I don't think this movie completely supports abuse, it also doesn't discredit it either. It doesn't show how the heroes ideologies are superior to those of Thanos. In fact, because Thanos wins it seems his idealogy is superior. In addition, the way the movie treats Thanos as the protagonist makes his abuse of people to have a very muddled morality value.

"It feels like you're saying that Disney/Marvel is obligated to make a happy ending childrens movie. You say ""Marvel movies are for everyone"" but the rating on this movie clearly shows that it's not. As a PG-13 movie they're blatantly saying ""this movie contains images and ideas that may not be suitable for small children"". 

More to the point. This movie is a TRAGEDY and that's what you should hold it up to. Compare it to the great tragedies in art, not it's predecessors. Compare it to Hamlet, probably the greatest example of the ""Everybody dies"" trope. This is very important because acknowledging that this movie is designed to be a tragedy addresses your other big issue...

Thanos, our protagonist (which we should establish to the uninformed DOES NOT equate to good guy), is a monster. In fact I don't think mentally ill, or crazy, or insane should be assigned to him. He has a goal, an admirable one, 'prevent the universe from facing extinction through overpopulation'. The movie starts off with Loki telling him ""you'll never be a god"" because that's literally how Thanos behaves the whole movie. He has religious, cult like, followers. He sacrifices his only son... err daughter ... to save humanity ... err the universe. He truly believes he's saving the universe. HE'S COMPLETELY WRONG! That's the tragedy. It's not that he's a 'movie-psycho'. If he were running around like any iteration of The Joker then we'd just write it of by saying ""He's batshit crazy"" and then our heros would have carte blanche to murder-death-kill him. I think that would DRASTICALLY mute the narrative depth that has been built up over SO many movies/years. It would've felt like all those giant blue beam in the sky movies where 'bad guy wants to apocalypse the world/universe because he's bad'. 

You say ""They think he's empathetic"" with a tone that feels like you think that's wrong and I think you're missing the point of empathy. It's not sympathy (feelings of pity and sorrow for someone else's misfortune), it's empathy (the ability to understand and share the feelings of another). We can understand Thano's feelings without agreeing with them. We can even feel those feelings with him without agreeing with him. That's pretty much the most important part of empathy, understanding somebody's feelings when our motivations/beliefs/ideals are completely different. Doing this is a really important part of accepting that ...

Thanos is a monster, who does and is responsible for monstrosities. It's hard to watch, and this movie DEFINITELY should've told us ahead of time that it had potentially triggering scenes/ideas within. But it tells the monster's story well, and trusts the audience can handle it. Thanos is a character who loves his daughter/s and believes that his abuse is the correct way to show that love? Yes, people like this exist. Yes some of people/children in the audience may be in that very abusive situation. And they're hopefully shown that Thanos is NOT a hero, a horrible father, and somebody who needs to be actively stopped. That last detail is important in a society that ignores its abusers and sorta just hopes or expects 'the problem will fix itself because all stories have a happy ending'. Hopefully good parents will have conversations with their children after watching this movie (which should ALWAYS happen, use art as a medium to communicate through). Hopefully people see the parallel in Thanos as an abuser to somebody they know and come to the conclusion that ""Somebody I know is NOT a hero, a horrible father, somebody who needs to be actively stopped"". This concept brings us back to ...

This movie is rated PG13, I wish there was like a pg17 rating because R ratings are now basically reserved for gore porn. There are REAL discussion points in a comic book movie, and I wish this movie had done more to say ""sit down and talk about this shit"". But it doesn't. Thankfully it's a tragedy. Which means instead of wrapping up a happy ending, giving us an acceptable resolve so we can skip home and back to our lives like nothing happened ... it punches us in the throat and rolls credits. And everyone's uncomfortable because in order to get the conclusion we need we have to wait. The production time of the sequel creates more dramatic tension for those of us invested in these stories ... and hype for everyone who just uses art for distraction.

It makes people feel some really negative emotions, it's a tragedy...

But as you pointed out that's not something children will understand. They'll just see what the movie says at face value. And as you went on, that niggling feeling that stayed despite how I reasoned out to myself why the movie is good became clearer. So thank you.

"I do enjoy your videos but this one I don't agree with really. Starting with starlord, he didn't really regress back to film one starkord. He didn't claim ownership of gamora either. Saying ""my girlfriend"" isn't saying you own someone. Anyway, back to the point, star lord acted exactly how his character would be expected to act in the situation. He's still a child inside with serious problems. He literally lost the person he's been in love with for four years and acted according to his character. 

With Thanos' plan, it wouldn't go back to the way it's been after 4000 years. If you did the math correctly (no hate) then you would've took into account the population curve, which is beginning to level off. Essentially the population has reached a balance and would remain at a certain amount. And adding more resources just further ruins the universe.

And the abuse part, that's kinda unjustified. Thanos has never abused gamora, he made her fight yeah but that's different. He never loved nebula.

And people getting angry over the fact that people died in this film annoy me. It's like they want these movies to be dumbed down for children. That leaves no room for stakes, and I'm happy they took a darker tone with this, and luckily I'm in the majority. I hope they keep a dark tone with the fourth avengers as it makes no sense to joke, even if the film does skip a few years into the future.",2,0,2018-09-01T12:38:13.000Z
"oversimplifying thanos's ""solution"" to simply be a reset isn't really fair but more than that it's sorta missing the point, thanos is a broken man, he believes in what he does not because of the proof he has to support his ideas, but because he had a solution to his home worlds death and could never really enact it. i agree that just throwing out he's crazy, mad, psycho isn't helpful, and also sorta just bad writing, but what i'm trying to say is that he's broken, the violence that he's seen, the guilt, the pressure that he put on himself to (in his mind) to save all of life, he broke became twisted. this is most easily seen in the fact he willing tortures his ""daughters"", which like other people down here have pointed out ""just cos he's an abuser doesn't mean he doesn't actually care"", but also in his ""solution"" with all the power he has at his disposal he rushes to the first solution he came up with for this problem he came up with all those years ago.

"I'm confused you thought the Joker was doing a better job then Batman and Harvey Dent who killed at least 20 people during the movie, and in another video you defended Loki who has killed countless numbers of people and justified it with his experiences. But when it comes to Thanos you seem to be coming at this topic from a personal place instead of looking at the logic the character feels. I'm not saying Thanos is right, and yes he is an evil abuser, but you seem to have a very narrow minded view of what love is when in truth it's not as black and white as you are making it out to be. 

We know that even slaves have complicated loving feelings towards their owners, we know this cause children who have been kidnapped even when given the freedom to walk outside by themselves doesn't run away. Even 18 year old's who gets sold like sex slaves once rescued in their 20's have a really hard time adjusting to normal life not just because they have trouble getting the horrible stuff that happened to them out of their head but because they have surrendered their freewill to another for so long and actually do feel love for the people who captured them. It's not the ideal love that we all think about when we hear the word, but it is love nonetheless. Because love at the end of the day is a evolutionary, biological, chemical survival mechanism. 

It's not only designed for us to find a mate and produce the next generation, but is used to make us feel bonded because for so many being with someone evil is better then being alone. Look at the way slaves were treated in Roman times, there was actually a hierarchy with some slaves being treated family butlers/servants, while others where thought off as completely disposable and could be used for sex, fighting and transactions with the owners not being capable of thinking of the lower slaves as anything else as walking and talking gold. The slaves that got the highest position that was optional for them, like well trained, groomed and most importantly tamed, gladiators or personal body slaves actually did grow to love their owners because the alternative was being killed, tortured, raped (which happened to both male and female salves during those times), and the best they could hope for was one day to buy their freedom if their owners decided that the cost of having them was greater then the work they would produce. And normally even if they did manage to get free, they couldn't work their way up to some status cause they had usually been branded and couldn't get work to even feed themselves. Many, particularly old people would surrender themselves to the Romans in hopes of getting a new master during the slave rebellion because they knew they could do nothing with their new freedom. Now obviously that is more then 10 kinds of ways of fucked up, but it was the reality that they where living in. 

You could argue Stockholm syndrome and you would be partially right, but the matter of fact is that it is possible to be an abuser or be abused and love each other. People that stay with an abusive partner doesn't do it only out of fear, cause a person in that position of fucked up power knows that if all they doll out is punishment eventually the person they are controlling will rebel against them. 

Read the book of the journalist who was helped captive for 3 years, the only thing he asked for was a yoga matt and in the beginning they did it to laugh at him, but eventually they saw him benefiting from it and he ended up teaching his captors how to do it right. At one point one of the guards had been careless and left a gun within his reach and had an oppertunity to escape or at least try. But in the end decided not to even though he actually thought he was going to be killed by them eventually. Now in his situation he was so old and had experienced western form of freedom for so long that he never grew to love his captors, but even he says there is an unexplainable bond that happens in that sort of situation. If you look at the relationship between Thanos and Gamora it's pretty much that of a child solder in africa who gets groomed to give the other kids hope that one day, they will have what little freedom that child soldier at the ""top"" has. They become their father figures and learns quickly it's grow strong or die. My friends grandfather had his mother raped and killed in front of him and was raised by the killer until he escaped Africa in the 70's and the day he found out that his mothers killer had been born. He not only started to cry but became deeply depressed and needed a psychiatrist to help him through it. Cause while he knew that his new life was better and that his mothers killer was a raping monster for almost 10 years he was the closest thing he had to a father. 

I'm not trying to justify Thanos at all, so please don't take what I have just said the wrong way or think that I am in anyway condoning such horrible acts. What I am saying is that while Thanos technically is an alien, aliens in the comic book world are more or less written like humans who just looks different. And his reasoning and action however flawed or evil are actually human, instead of wanting to impress death like in the comics. He looks at the world from a Malthus or pre 2015 China point of view when it comes to population control. The reason he doesn't want to reduce the population down to the number you suggest is because he has seen on Gamora's planet and probably more planets that it's not only about the amount of resources but how they get distributed and by doing reducing the population randomly. He is actually doing what you suggested the Joker did in the Dark Knight, although while the Joker wanted to spread chaos, Thanos sees it as creating order when the people that have survived now knows the most horrible action that can happen to them and the remaining people gather together to make the best out of what is left. 

What Thanos doesn't take into account however is that we have seen what happens when certain ""tribes"" gets seperated that where once bigger, smaller population means smaller amounts of knowledge and can make people go backwards. Like the tribe of about 10.000 people who got separated from a group of 70.000 people from various tribes because of a flooding. Not only did the population shrink, the environment they where living in made them revert back to a more basic form of living because they didn't have the knowledge of how things was done with having lost it over several generations. 

Yes more people means more mouths to feed, but also more people means more chances of people figuring out the most effective way of doing things. Now obviously the technology that is already on earth with having so much recorded will make sure that old knowledge won't be lost. But potential new knowledge however is literally turned to ashes. 

And when it comes to the marvel movies should be for all ages argument, I agree, but that doesn't mean we should shelter kids from this movie. Seriously before their 10 they have access to seeing people getting fucked by a horse in their pocket. And action video games is now mostly accepted to be played by kids even if their Mature rated so it's not like this movie is the most horrible thing they have ever seen, they play games regularly where you see brains being splattered on the walls. I actually think it was important for kids to see a movie like this, while those of us who knows most of the deaths won't stick, this movie handles very complicated and complex issues while being very careful about the message that it sends. While they try to make you understand why Thanos does what he does, it never once condones his action and every sceen he is in every hero threats him like the monster that he is. 

 It's okay that you didn't like the movie, and I respect your opinion even though I disagree with it, but while my nephew was really sad to see spiderman die, before I told him that they will bring him and the others back I was curious about what he had experienced watching this movie. It was clear that he now understood that just because you do your best and try to be a good person no matter what, doesn't automatically mean that you will win. I was actually really surprised that he understood Thanos' argument, that he really loved Gamora and while we objectively can call him evil, Thanos doesn't see himself that way. 

For 18 movies and dozens of other shows, games and movies he has seen the heroes come out on top. And that is great, it encourages him to be the best person he can be and I couldn't be more proud when he came home from school one day after we had started to see phase 1 together and Captain America had made a big impact on him. He stopped three kids from beating up a fellow classmate, without resorting to violence himself, he just grabbed one by the jacket to get him off and stepped in front of them while he yelled out for help. 3 of his friends came, held down the main bully until a teacher came while the other two ran away. The kid who had been beaten tried to kick the main bully while he was down and my newphew held him back and said they would tell the teachers what had happened but that hurting him now would just make him a bully aswell and that he hated bullies. 

Seriously that is incredible for a 10 year old boy to do. Some people ridicule comic book movies and say they are just for dumb people or small children, that they are just stupid fantasies (while they themselves believes in an invisible man in the sky who has a naughty or nice list with 10 things that completely forbidden but only two of which concern basic human rights) meant to cater to the male ego fantasy of punching your way out of a situation. I see it as teaching everyone various complicated moral lessons without the mind control part that comes with religion.",0,1,2018-09-01T11:39:02.000Z

Over the past 12 or so months I have found more and more problems with your reviews where it seems that you take the opposite view of the majority online possibly to bring voices to the decedenting opinions but I am losing the battle of finding merit in those perspectives. Perhaps there is good content to be made from those perspectives but thats not been my experience with your videos as of late.

This video was poorly conceived and poorly constructed only held together by the ever tight editing. I think your views on the messages, the characterization and the tone of the movie were all wrong. I think it was very evident about half way through the video you had a very heavy ax to grind from the onset, and I think you were extremely unfair in your criticism. Having a movie from the perspective of the villain doesnt mean the film agrees with the villain, I would honestly say you cannot find a single, a single example of the film agreeing with Thanos in the whole run time. His actions are condemned in the film, his behavior is seen as cruel as manipulative, his goal seems insane and watching him win results in having half the cast die doesnt seem to win the audience over to his cause, instead it shows the real result of such an individual winning. You didnt want to listen to what the film had to say about him because you were clearly too shaken up by the actions he took. Knowing if an author agrees or disagrees with a character is important to contextualize the narrative, and to conflate the two would lead you to miss characterizing any medium. This whole video is without any redeeming quality and should be-- to be perfectly honest, an embarrassment. 

I hope your health continues to improve and that you find the narrative voice again that made me subscribe at the start, but I have been feeling the need to turn off the video around the 60% mark on the last several reviews just means the channel no longer is for me.",1,0,2018-09-01T11:30:08.000Z
I dont think he actually loved her even though he was granted the soul stone. I think he thought he loved her. and he probably cared about her more (she was his fave daughter). gamora says it herself. 'this isnt love'. but I do understand your point,0,0,2018-09-01T11:29:07.000Z
"I think you missed the whole point of Thanos. He’s wasn’t portrayed as mentally ill, that’s a small portion of the audience that try’s to say that. He was portrayed as a monster, a tyrant, someone who’s truly evil. The writers weren’t equating abuse with love, they were showing that what Thanos sees as love is unmistakably abuse, because he’s truly evil.

 Thanos’ warped and skewed mentality is not a work of fiction either. There have been many people throughout human history that were truly evil. Adolf Hitler killed 10 million people because he believed they were what was wrong with Germany, a country that he loved in his own warped sense of reality. Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong killed hundreds of millions under their justification and perception of communism. Genghis Khan raped so many women that .5% of the population today (350 million people) carry his blood as well as killing so many people that the carbon dioxide level across the planet was changed. Monsters and true evil exist and that’s what makes him such a great villain. You don’t believe that he’s justified, but you do believe that he believe he’s justified.

You’re wrong about the MCU being for everyone though, Marvel makes movies for people ages 13 and older. That’s why all of their movies carry a PG13 rating and not a G rating. In 7th grade history class students learn about Hitler, Stalin, and Khan and the atrocities they committed. While this might come off as harsh and I don’t mean it to personally attack anyone, if Infinity War was “too much” at moments then you have thin skin and you need to work on your mental fortitude because the movie was never overly graphic or gory and fictional depictions of tragedies shouldn’t have that much of an effect on you, especially if learning about real world examples doesn’t cause you to have the same reaction.",1,0,2018-09-01T11:17:37.000Z

"The question of whether or not thanos's plan would work in the real world is not an interesting one, in my opinion. I think that it is fairly obvious that it wouldn't but you can't build super suits that spontaneously create nano-matter from nothing in the real world either. 
They make sure that we know that, in the context of the film, Thanos's methods have already succeeded in creating paradises on other planets he has decimated and that his own planet was destroyed by overpopulation, so we know that he is at least on to something or has reason to believe so with all his heart. So the interesting question is this, if you truly believed that you could essentially end all suffering in the universe and maintain life by sacrificing 50% of it, would you be willing to do it? Assuming you were right, would it be justifiable to do such a thing? It is essentially the trolly problem: do you let five people die or throw a switch and kill one person in order to save the most lives? Most people say they would throw the switch in order to save five lives. However, when you change the equation and say that you have to physically shove someone in order to kill them and save five lives most people say they wouldn't, even though the math is the same. From Thanos's perspective, the only reason why someone wouldn't directly murder one person to save five is that they lack the fortitude necessary to make tough decisions. However, that doesn't mean he enjoys hurting people. I think that the reason Thanos fights so desperately for the infinity stones is because he has been forced to push the man onto the rally tracks over and over again and he sees them as a way to convert it into the far simpler and easier flip switch. If you knew for certain you had to kill millions of people to save all life and there was a way that you could finish the job instantaneously and relatively painlessly how much suffering would you be willing to inflict in order to stop from having to hurt people anymore for the rest of your life? From Thanos's perspective, the avengers aren't trying to stop him from committing genocide, he has been doing that for centuries already and he will continue to do so with or without the stones. What they are doing from his perspective is hampering his ability to do his duty in a quick and painless manner, threatening to force him to create more suffering and death than I'd necessary to achieve his goal.
I should add that, even in the context of the film, I think thanos is the hight of arrogance to think that he has the right to make decisions on behalf of the entire universe and I am no fan of the idea of the ends justifying the means. That being said, I am willing to put myself into the shoes of someone who does think this way in order to better understand what drives people who do terrible things and to better understand myself, what I am capable of, and why I hold the beliefs that I hold.
The fact that you spent this entire review lamenting that they would even attempt to make someone who commits such heinous acts appear complex and sympathetic in any way leads me to believe that you haven't put enough thought into your own moral positions to risk seriously challenging them by attempting to understand the perspective of someone you find morally repugnant. 

Arguably they could have done a better job with suspending the audiences disbelief when it came to Thanos's plan. Personally A few quick lines mentioning that his automated bio-soldiers provide aid to the decimated populations of the planets he visits in order to help them get back on their feet or something like that and perhaps mentioning that he might use the stones to continually manage the population and keep it steady at the sweet spot would have been all I needed to be completely satisfied in that regard. Maybe they'll elaborate on that in the sequel. 

Your comment about the movie trying to paint what Thanos had with Gamora as though it were a healthy form of love was especially  ridiculous, given that the first person to shout, ""this is not love!!"" before being tossed over a cliff was Gamora herself. Just because Thanos is an abusive, genocidal asshole doesn't mean that he cannot be as capable of complex and contradictory emotions as any other human and people do all kinds of heinous shit to people they love. 
And no, Marvel does not have a responsibility to sacrifice depth of character for the sake of your personal moral positions on how to handle trauma and abuse in media. 
I'll give it to you that perhaps the overwhelming existential despair at the core of this movie should have earned it an R rating. I can imagine a few parents who loved Thor Ragnarok taking their kids to this movie and being completely unprepared for what they got.",0,0,2018-09-01T10:08:26.000Z

"12:50 ""It's a movie where the abuser won.""

It isn't a films moral duty to punish the bad guy just because he's bad. I'm not sure why it's irresponsible not to, either.

I can see how watching an hour and a half of footage leading to the most powerful and least morally justified character winning is probably super frustrating especially after 2016 where we got basically a whole year leading up to a similar circumstance, but I'd like to say that A) Realistically,  it's a two part movie where the abuser wins momentarily half-way through, and B) I sort of don't understand how that's a failure on the part of the film(?)

The abuser winning is the emotional crutch of the entire movie, it's what every decision leads up to. The filmmakers go through multiple different strides to say ""This man is wrong and his philosophy is flawed,"" through multiple different scenes, including the Gamora scene you showed footage from, but in the end he wins anyway. That's the point, this film is intended to be seen as a tragedy. I imagine that in Part 2, the filmmakers are intending to have some sort of catharsis for the viewers.

On the topic of Thanos loving Gamora, aka 'the thing everyone in comments thinks is the only important part of the video' I don't have much to say. I wouldn't argue that abuse equates to love as much as Thanos loved despite the abuse. When Gamora cries over Thanos' fake corpse, I saw that as more her emotions rising to the surface after a super duper complicated feeling decision, but def not mourning. Thanos *thought* she was mourning but that was his ego getting the better of him.

Also the ability to understand a bad guys motivations ie empathy isn't equal to agreeing or even thinking his motivations make any sense.",1,0,2018-09-01T09:45:50.000Z
"(Good god, so many comments... mine is just gonna get lost in the mix...)
I think the reason both this film AND this video are divisive is because we all have different perspectives on the dynamics of abuse.

"The reason for the constant torture is because the main theme of the film is sacrifice. What warrants sacrifice, when is sacrifice immoral, when is it heroic, and how sacrifice is heroism in of itself, but only when not at the expense of the loss of life. Thanos is the narrative protagonist, but he's still the villain because he is a dark reflection of the heroes. He is so sure of his heroism that he is willing to sacrifice everything, which is in direct conflict with Cap's ""We don't trade lives"". The torture is not arbitrary raising of stakes, every instance tests a characters heroism, and each leads to Thanos's victory, showing how heroism is about the act, not the outcome. Loki sacrificing the space stone for Thor, and then sacrificing his life to stop Thanos, Tony sacrificing his connection with Pepper to go into space, Peter sacrificing Gamora, Thanos sacrificing Gamora and half the universe, Strange sacrificing the time stone for Tony, Vision sacrificing himself for Cap, and Wanda sacrificing Vision. All are necessary continuations of these characters arcs. Loki finally becomes a true hero, Tony once again reverts back to his inner demons (as shown by the nano-tech armour) demonstrating the never ending cycle his character is trapped in, Peter is finally able to accept death on a personal level, but has his resolution taken away from Thanos and once again becomes the emotionally scarred, struggling man child who cannot deal with death, Thanos reveals his capacity to love and we're reminded of Gamora's evil origins, Strange learns to stop thinking about the big picture and focus on the individual, Vision learns what it means to be a hero. These are all done for specific character purposes, just as every other choice in the MCU.

And entertainment? This film isn't meant to be entertaining. It's not making light of the pain. It's not funny. This is serious emotional trauma that these characters are being put through. And that doesn't just artificially raise the stakes. It invests you in the stakes. All your favourite characters could meet their end at any moment, and you are invested in the film. Those are good stakes for your film to have, not cheap.

Thanos's solution is not accepted as truth. No one is ever meant to think that Thanos is right. That's the point. Thanos is the protagonist. He faces opposition against everyone else who says he is wrong. And he does not care. He faces all opposition with the knowledge that he is right, that he is the good guy, and that he must defeat the villains and achieve his goal. And we know he is wrong. Everyone in the film knows he is wrong. But Thanos doesn't. Empathy is different from sympathy. You can be emphatic for a person you know is wrong.

Cows eat more food because they're herbivores. There's less energy and nutrients in plants than in meat.

Abuse is not equated with love. Thanos is the villain. He's the bad guy. He does bad things, because his moral code is incorrect. And abuse is one of them, That still doesn't mean he doesn't care for Gamora in some capacity. But as Gamora says, ""This isn't love"". The film never says Gamora is wrong. It's heavily implied Gamora is correct.

You have correctly identified that Peter has regressed to his old behaviour. But rather than trying to identify why, you've just said this is a fault. Peter completes his arc in this film. He has had to deal with distant death when he is a child, and lose his father figure because of things out of his control (Ego wasn't his daddy). In this film, Peter has to make a conscious decision which will result in the death of someone he loves dearly. He has to make that choice. And he does. And his arc should be complete. But it's not. Because even though he pulled the trigger, Gamora doesn't die. And thus Peter is robbed of that resolution. He is left in fluctuation, having done the final thing necessary to become a proper adult, but not going through the emotional pain necessary. And thus he regresses, because he doesn't know what else to do. What can he do? How can you go back to being mature when trying to be mature did nothing?

We root for every hero. That's the advantage of the cinematic universe model. Time is not needed to establish a POV character. And you don't need a POV character when you already have an intimate knowledge of the universe. POV characters exist so that information is being relayed to both the character and the audience, making exposition natural rather than clunky.

It is a narrative. It's a different kind of narrative. One that is only possible with a cinematic universe. And one that works. This is more than just an event. It's a TV finale. After all, the MCU is nothing more than TV on the big screen. Individual episodes with different directors bringing their own style for variety with a season long narrative through line. The film is the result of every other film. The only thing that isn't a continuation is Thanos, and that's why he is the protagonist. Because he's the one new thing here.",1,0,2018-09-01T08:42:52.000Z

"Your take on Gamora: it IS possible for people to love their abusers. I’m not saying that they should, but if you spend your whole life around someone, even an abusive figure, some part of you may still love them. And abusive people often believe that they love their victims. That is no excuse for abuse. Thought poorly represented, I believe that idea was in mind during Gamora’s death. Part of gamora’s is arc as a character is realizing that her relationship with Thanos and everything she believed was wrong.

 I could get behind him killing her and still loving her(""kill your loved one to save the world"" is a fairly common trope that is used twice again in THIS movie - Peter trying to kill Gamora and Scarlet Witch trying to kill Vision), but ending their shared story of an abusing father and his emotionally confused child on that ""he really loved her!""note is a STATEMENT. It doesn't matter if it might be plausible, the way it is framed is a STATEMENT and it excuses the abuse, almost justifying it. Any ambiguity is immediately shut down by giving him the soul stone, IMMEDIATELY devalidating Gamoras often cited ""This isn't love!"".

I understand your point that this movie might be really, well, _triggering_ for people who were abused, especially children - that is why content/trigger warnings are a thing, btw.
But I don't see how an abusive parent is automatically incapable of feeling any other emotions. I _really_ don't want to downplay child abuse - it's a crime, and unforgivable - but I do think that many people are capable of committing crimes, when pushed in the right way. I personally know people who were abused as children by their parents, and decided to reconcile with them.
Anyway, I really liked your video overall, you made your point very well. It's just that I don't quite agree with your reasoning :D You're absolutely right, however, that the tone is very dire, and I see how that can be off-putting.

I WANT to see the bad guy pull out all the shitty, torturous, abusive stops because then when good triumphs in the end the message is clear: Being a horrible, evil person may let you get what you want but it won't let you keep it.

The human experience is complex in ways the reviewer is unable to grapple with. We can't define a person by only one aspect of their existence, no matter how horrendous it may be. Abusers are not emotionless psychopaths, nor are they so simplistic as to be reduced to beasts. Believe it or not, they're human like you and me. Which is what makes this character so difficult, because we can't paint him as irredeemably evil and actually have to deal with the fact that there actually is a thin line between humanity and monstrosity.

You eliminate half of all sentient living things in the universe it would take far more than 4000 years for it to repopulate.  Maybe you shouldn't of ignored all the math part for your math section.

As for Abuse=Love argument? Your argument makes zero sense.  Abuse and victim relationships are very complex.  You seem to make them 2 dimensional which is wrong. They are very complex and to ignore this would make the entire Thanos/Gamora relationship feel fake.  Thanos in his ""mind"" does love his daughters.  In his sick twisted way, he ""cares"" for them.  It's not real or healthy love, it's the sick love one finds in the evil mind of an abuser.  Abusers will always revert to tears and statements of love when their victim is taken away from them.   Victims of abuse more often than not will return to their abusers in the real world and claim love for them as well. Gamora hate for Thanos is real, her emotion when she thinks she killed him would be what one would expect from a victim killing a ""father"" like abuser.  What did you want for her to breakout in a happy dance?  That's not how the real world works.  That would be stupid.

"I feel like the simple fact that thanos won/accomplished his goal is clouding a lot of people's judgement of him being a great villain. I honestly feel he was a badly written, inconsistent character who is only interesting because he succeeded in his goal. Outside of that he's your typical villain who is doing evil just because. His motivation doesn't make sense, his plan/reasonns doesn't make sense and as hard as the movie tries to humanise him so the audience can empathise with him, his scenes with gamora left me cold. 

Seriously think of any of the typical villains in the MCU, outside of his power level and the fact he succeeded, what makes thanos more complex than any of the typical villains in the MCU(I'm not even talking about the well-written ones like killmonger/vulture) who believe that what they are doing is right despite how illogical it is. The main difference is thanos is given more screen-time and the audience is consistently beaten over the head by him with how he believes what he is doing is right and explaining his reasons. That's basically it, no backstory is shown of how or why he got to that point we are just meant to believe him cause he says so when his actions throughout the movie is so illogical that he's the last person in the movie you should take on his word. So what we are left with is a character going from location to location, killing people, occasional explaining why until he wins/accomplishes his goal at the end. Throw in a couple of scenes where he cries for someone he 'loves' because he obviously cares and has feelings and you have this supposedly empathetic/complex great villain that many will have you believe he is.

I have no problem with a villain doing the wrong thing who believes in himself to be right. That's what you get with your typical villain, I also have no problem with such villain accomplishing his goal but it seems a lot of people are letting that last part cloud their judgement of him being this complex, well written villain when he is far from it. There's nothing consistent about the character, the movie tried to present him a way that contradicted everything he was doing in the movie and that is my biggest issue of him as a character.

Joker in the dark knight worked so well as a villain because he is given no backstory, no one know how or why he got to the point where he wants to cause chaos in gotham just because. Therefore his actions throughout the movie of someone who is unhinged is consistent with the character shown. No one believes anything his says and there's very little if any logic to anything he does in the movie. He untimately wants to cause chaos in gotham and that's it, the movie doesn't beat you with him explaining why he is doing it or try to make him empathetic, they stick to a consistent theme of a character who is unpredictable and mysterious throughout and it worked as a result.

Likewise Killmonger worked but of a very different in black panther because the movie went out of its way to not only tell you but actually show you his backstory. The ending shot of the first scene is with him as a child looking up to an advanced aircraft that is leaving above his apartment which we later learn is of an actual blood relative after they had killed his father. His backstory is mostly shown to the viewer and the only expository parts we're given is when ross goes through his time in the Black ops. As a result towards the ending despite the fact he had done a lot of violent things leading up and had an illogical/immoral plan that involved arming people to kill their oppressors, when he asks t'challa ""could you believe it, a kid from oakland growing up believing in fairytales"" not only does it work and is consistent to the character through his backstory, it allows the audience to be both empathetic/sympathetic to him. That's what made him such a great villain.

So here you have two totally different types of villains who work in different ways because there's a consistency in how they are written compared to Thanos whom you felt the writers wanted to make him a bit of both these characters, They wanted to create an unhinged and illogical(mad titan/crazy) character bent on genocide but spent the whole movie having him explain why he was doing what he was doing. They also then wanted one whom you could understand and see his viewpoints but didn't bother to show(not tell) any backstory to how and why he became who  he is. So you're left with a character who is neither here nor there and just an overpowered, crazy, evil villain who wins at the end. That's complexity for you right there.",0,10,2018-09-01T06:49:50.000Z

"I do see the concern about abuse and all that. 
And you're right... I guess the movie isn't for everyone. But it's hopelessness is kinda the whole point. This IS Thanos' movie. But we're not meant to agree with him. We're just meant to see what he's like and see how HE attains victory. 
That's like saying Breaking Bad was about why drugs and crime is justified. It's not. Quite the opposite. 
And the concerns about kids thinking that abuse = love is the whole reason the movie is rated PG-13. The PG stands for parental guidance. I think it's pretty clear that the film makers weren't saying that Gamora and Thanos loved each other, but that Thanos is insane enough to *believe* he loves Gamora.
And it's quite clear that Gamora was crying over ""killing"" Thanos not because she loved him but actually because she hated him just that much. The level of catharsis was just overwhelming. Was Peter smiling when he took down his dad? No, he was frustrated to the very end. Giving a very bitter one liner towards the man who played with his emotions in such a twisted way. Gamora was RAISED by Thanos. I'm sure that if it was Nebula who killed Thanos, she, too, would've started crying her eyes out (if she can still cry).

But you're right. The movie... isn't for everyone. Because it is so good and well written, the trauma that occurs on screen actually feels real. Unlike some of the other crappy dark movies out there, this one actually hit home for people. Like, I knew Spider-man was gonna come back in the next film, but that didn't make his death not sad. I felt complete sorrow and terror when the kid begged for his life. A tear actually shed from my eye. I gotta respect that kinda film making.",0,0,2018-09-01T06:31:36.000Z

No amount of cute ewoks were going to fix that bleak outlook, especially in a kid's film. (George Lucas wanted these changes because he thought they would appeal more his young daughter.)

"""The abuser and abused child love each other?"" Maybe you've never lived through abuse, or known anyone who has, but yes... in a horrible, unhealthy, and not in the least bit authentic way, yes, that's what they THINK. Are they wrong? YES. And that's kind of the point. Gamora was Stockholmed. Her entire childhood was an act she was forced to play out and believe because she had no choice. She has horrific issues of guilt over playing out this monstrous role that her father prescribed for her, and her tears at stabbing her father are tears over the monster she is convinced that she is. It's the tears of someone who has been brutalized over years into believing that SHE is as much the problem as her father. And Thanos? He uses that. Thanos is a horrible, manipulative psychopath and abusive father figure. He thinks he knows what is best for everyone better than they know themselves, and yes, he THINKS turning Gamora into a killer is a parent's kind of love. Now, is it love that people should emulate and look up to? Dear god, no. Absolutely not. Nobody thinks that, except for the psychopath at the center of this movie. So if it's not love, you may wonder, why did the Soul Stone come to him? The point is the sacrifice had to be real to him. Not whether this sick purple asshole's feeling is some objective metaphysical concept of love, but whether it is a legitimately painful sacrifice of someone he believes he loves. The entire point is that Thanos is wrong, but utterly filled with conviction that he is right. That makes him terrifying.",0,0,2018-09-01T06:13:30.000Z
"My take on Gamora crying was because of that cathartic feeling when you know an abuser wont be able to hurt you anymore... not because she deeply loves Thanos in return (at least, not only) .

if anything, i feel that the movie shows a full, far-reaching extent of the consequences of one's selfish, abusive behaviour, and isn't glorifying Thanos' abusive nature at all.

i didnt have too much of a problem with Star Lord's behaviour; from the previous GOTG films he has always been depicted as rash and emotional (and rather self-centered), and one can argue losing a parent is wildly different to losing a romantic partner.",0,0,2018-09-01T06:13:04.000Z
"I must say that while I agree with you in many respects (and respect and understand what I don't agree with) I disagree with your take on abuse; not so much in the film, but in general. 
The thing that makes abusive relationships so psychologically devastating, hard to accept and harder to escape from is that there is often genuine affection on both sides. It's an unhealthy, toxic love, and one could argue that it's not ""real"" love, but it's there. It's what happens when the ties that bind become wounded and fester.

As such, I think that element of Gamora and Thanos' relationship was done right, and it very rarely is. It's Gamora's reduction to a plot device (to fuel her abuser's narrative, no less) that leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth. I really feel like there were a ton of talented people on the project who realized this (but weren't in a position to retool the plot) and tried their best, but...there was no saving it.",0,0,2018-09-01T06:04:51.000Z

Thanos is the old brutal dictator who tortured and murdered his own countrymen while making a better infrastructure for future generations to utilize. 

I see Thanos and I think of Hitler and the Autobhan. Modern Germany runs on infrastructure that was created during the Nazi era (and destroyed in the war they created but rebuilt again), Germans continue to use a variety of products made by companies created in the Nazi era comissioned by Hitler, the Volkswagen Beetle started out in Hitler's reign for instance, and we still buy them without the association with Hitler.

Like all relationships, abusive relationships can be complicated.  If all they were was an evil person and constant abuse, they'd be easier to leave.  But the truth is, most abusive relationships aren't abusive all the time.  Or even most of the time.  The abuser can be loving and caring for large portions of the relationship.  This cycle of love and abuse is what is so sinister and what keeps otherwise smart, strong people stuck in these relationships.  The idea (that you express) that someone who loves another person can't also abuse that person is the kind of idea that contributes to trapping those people.",1,0,2018-09-01T05:21:51.000Z

"This is a very confusingly personal video. I have discussed this film with hundreds of people, and that includes people that have suffered nigh-unthinkable abuses and trauma, and this was never brought up as an issue - but it has been brought up as a positive. A close friend of mine was tearful in remarking how devastatingly accurate Gamora's reaction was to thinking she had killed Thanos, her abuser and surrogate father. They know these feelings because they've thought of them, what it would be like, to confront someone like that. The same goes for the complexity of the abuser's mind and how they process their idea of love.

Mikey, I get that you're particularly sensitive to these things, and you're free to make videos on whatever subjects you like, but your inability to emotionally deal with fiction, in a way a vast majority of people of all ages, backgrounds, and past/on-going experiences can, does tarnish your credibility as someone who reviews and analyzes film.",3,3,2018-09-01T05:12:09.000Z

"I find it funny that people go on and on about the 'universe' accepting Thanos love, without questioning what sort of a people, and they were just people, would willingly give near infinite power to whoever was willing to kill those they loved most. As a character test, it's a pretty shitty line to draw. And it certainly didn't require some sort of ultra-platonic, super-good-plus-plus, love to beat the infinities... you just had to care _enough_ about someone that losing them would be an actual sacrifice. Thanos met that minimum bar of caring... About literally only one person in his entire fucking life. And he had a history of using them and treating them like shit.

Thanos didn't get the Soul stone because 'The Universe Agrees This is True Love!!'... He got it because a race who thought themselves wise was stupid enough to believe the world only shook out into 'good people' who wouldn't sacrifice those they loved without very good reason and 'bad people' who were incapable of love. Even then the movie makes it clear Thanos only makes the cut by the barest of margins.

So can we stop pretending that getting the Soul Stone required Thanos to prove he held 'True Love' to the universe itself, and instead take it as the searing criticism of black and white world views it was intended to be?",1,0,2018-09-01T05:08:45.000Z
"This is the worst video you have ever made, simply because the arguments don't hold up. I've disagreed with a lot of what you've said on the channel, but I always could follow the logic of how you got there. This video seems to boil down to Because the movie made me deal with some hard emotions it was fundamentally flawed from the outset. 

Personal feelings will always color our opinions on things, and that's alright. But to level a charge that this film wields trauma like a circus act is simply wrong. Go watch the recent CinemaWins video and its made pretty clear there that the scene between Gamora and Thanos does not say that abuse = love. She literally tells Thanos ""This isn't love."" As for the scene where she ""kills"" Thanos it shows that he is more than a rampaging idiot with power. He likes the mind games, and I think that Gamora's breakdown was likely indicative of a cathartic release for killing the man who ruined her life. Hell, there is probably some Stockholm syndrome mixed in there as well. Nobody in the theater actually thought that Thanos would let Peter kill Gamora, he was simply seeing if he could muster up the courage to do as Gamora asked. 

As for the stakes being unjustifiably high, what would you have preferred the movie do? You don't spend 10 years and 18 movies leading up to a storyline that is low stakes. Thor literally saved the universe as we know in his second movie, so its not like we jumped from Iron Man fighting a dude on a Nascar track to a psychopathic giant with a god complex and a ruthless approach to everything without the groundwork being laid down first. His motivations are established extremely well in the scene with Dr. Strange where he explains that his planet went extinct because they did nothing. If they had decided to kill half their population and then implemented practices such as China's One child policy, then a second culling could have been avoided. He sees this happen, becomes convinced that he is right and because he is psychopathic, he thinks the next logical step is to prevent total destruction of a planet by carrying out his plan on a galactic scale. The dots all connect. Obviously, no one in their right mind would consider this a ""good"" solution, but the Georgia Guidestones are proof that people have thought of this before, but on a more extreme scale. So your argument should be that Thanos is not evil enough, not that he is too evil. 

Also also, is it really surprising that the guy who has committed planetary genocide is willing to keep his daughter who he has mercilesly ripped apart her whole life in some state of torture. It's probably like any other Wednesday to him, which is why he is the BAD guy of the film. The entire point of the movie is that death, destruction, sorrow, and other bad adjectives are what is left in the wake of his success. His success is not championed, it is condemned. You have fundamentally misunderstood the movie's message.

Finally, I really enjoyed the Guardian's portion of this movie (Also rehire James Gunn). All the characters play off of each other well, and Peter reverting back to a manchild makes sense given how we saw him react to Ego's revelation that he killed his mother. He shot him, knowing full well that it would do absolutely no good. The one person that he has come to trust and love in one way after his mother is Gamora, and he is probably not in the best emotional state after working himself up to kill her and it being for nothing.",3,1,2018-09-01T05:08:28.000Z
"I really respect your opinion and the issues you addressed about how victims of abuse may respond was eye opening. But I'd just like to say that for one when Gamora cried after posibbly killing Thanos was a cathartic response to ridding herself of her oppressor. The issue with Starlord can be seen as jarring yet if you think about it, it makes sense. In the two guardians movies it dealt with Peter dealing with the deaths of his loved ones, even killing his last blood relative but also understanding that he now has his own family in the guardians. This is a similar arc to Gamora which makes it easier for them to connect, they both want a family. Gamora completes Starlord which in my eyes justifies his complete lack of rational when he attacks Thanos, Starlord lost a part of himself, his other half in Gamora, the half that gave him a reason to fight for his family.",0,0,2018-09-01T05:06:54.000Z

When you make this type of the movie that is a behemoth of a blockbuster, it is irresponsible to have characters such as Thanos. They aren't a representation of only themselves.

"I think something people have to remember is that Thanos' plan might not make sense to many, because it's simply a re-write of his ORIGINAL plan in the comics. Thanos eliminated half of all life in an effort to impress Mistress Death and establish his godhood after obtaining all six stones. They chose not to go with that route, because not only would it be incredibly easy to predict the outcome of the movie, but because they wanted to create a more complex character with complex motives. They wanted people to be conflicted by his choices, they wanted people to be divided in those who understand or at least empathize with him, and those who see him as insane. In his eyes, he is trying to save the universe. That's the point. He thinks he's doing a good thing, and he's fueled by the fact that his home planet DIED because no one acted. So, in an effort to save everyone else, HE is acting. I love you Mikey and will always support you, I just can't really agree with your stance in this video.",1,1,2018-09-01T04:51:52.000Z

"There were a few things you said that I disagree with, but I wanted to talk about the abuse = love point. I don't think Marvel is saying that abuse equals love. They are saying Thanos loved Gamora. I believe he loved her in the way abusers love the people they abuse. They never see the true harm they cause. If they did, they wouldn't be abusers. In context to this film. Thanos believed he loved Gamora. It is shown that he favored her. The soul stone does not need to decipher if the love is healthy or true only that the person making the sacrifice believes they love the person they are sacrificing. 

For Gamora, I think she may have cared somewhat for him. It is shown that he favored her and I imagine there were times in her life with him where he was kind to her. I think she remembers that and it has an effect on her. 

Overall all I think the writers and the Russos did their best to show the complexities of the relationship between the two characters. 

Compare the relationship of Thanos and Gamora in this film to the relationship of Bella and Edward in Twilight. Infinity War shows us that the abusive father is the villain. Twilight shows us that the abusive boyfriend is the hero.",0,0,2018-09-01T04:29:22.000Z
"Look, before I ramble, you're points are valid on some form, and I respect your opinion to the greatest degree. But I have some issues. 

Firstly, I have to be blunt. Marvel Movies vary in degrees, and I understand the general consensus is that they're made for everyone. While true, I think people misinterpret that phrase. It means that there's a movie for everyone within this cinematic universe, and the thing that keeps people coming back is variation. That's Marvel's strong suit, and that's what kept it going for this point forward. 

That's an issue I want to stress to you greatly. Marvel NEEDS variation in how it does things to keep going forward. If this movie wasn't structured a certain way, it would have ended up as just an average movie, one of the most highest complaints audiences have addressed over and over. 

I believe Marvel was correct in taking a risk with this movie and touching on uncomfortable themes. It was within it's design, and that's okay. These are the movies that stand out, take them away from being pure entertainment value. 

Now, addressing the abuse thing. Kids will automatically reject Thanos due to the fact he's the villain and he's outright attacking their heroes. I know that's blunt and a predictable answer, but that's going to be the general result. Unfortunately, there's risk for every single movie that something will be interpreted wrong, and while not ideal, that's the risk of art. It invokes different emotions for everyone, and that's not always going to be a positive thing. It becomes a problem when it becomes the general consensus, or at least forms a damaging opinion on a wide degree. 

I'm going to get kind of deep here for a minute. Love. Unfortunately, it's so broad a term it can be interpreted in any form. The philosophical definition ranges it from brotherly love, pure lust, and romantic, etc. Overall, the general definition is caring about something on some level. 

You can disagree with that, but at the end of the day, it's one of those things that is hard to define. And abuse is an even more complex subject. One thing that is constant is abuse is never fucking okay, but the abusers are on some vague level human, and therefore, most of the time in a twisted sense, will care for something. 

The Soul Stone demands something to be given that you cherish to some degree, basically some form of sacrifice that will cost you. Perhaps the way they set up 'love' was a poor move, since it invites poor interpretation, but again, it all depends on how the majority takes it. 

I nearly completely agree on your point about the Guardians, although I think Star Lord's development from being a complete man child was hurt by Guardians 2, which went completely backwards on him. Gunn, the writer of both movies, wrote the Guardians parts. This is just simply a problem carried over from the other movie rather than completely on Infinity War. 


Anyway, I hope what I'm saying makes sense.  If kids can handle the Joker, Killmonger, Loki, and other villain arcs that run the risk of being damaging, they'll be okay here with Thanos. And as for the whole 'half the universe' ? It's in the comics, it's dramatic, and as for the math, people forget the casualty rates will be high enough to set humanity back at least a bit (falling planes, delicate work that would go horribly wrong if a person disappeared,global car crashes, etc.). It's , remarkably, an actual philosophy, and there have been people who thought on that dangerous scale, which makes it, unfortunately, realistic.

"I LOVE your channel and I normally respect a difference of opinion, but this particular take seems wildly unfair. I'm not much a Marvel fan, but to counter your main point about the movie, Marvel movies not only are not all ages affairs, but they made it a point to build up to this movie with mature subject matter. Iron Man 3, Civil War, Black Panther, and Thor Ragnarok were all films that handled very deep topics in a not child oriented way. Infinity War is the logical conclusion, and it is PG-13, so the messages it sends have the leeway to be nuanced or even immoral, because anyone old enough to watch the movie is old enough to at least feign understanding of those concepts. I thought the violence scenes were graphic, but it is a war for their lives. This movie is dealing with the concept of zealotry and abuse. They aren't to be taken lightly. Sacrifice and Mortality are big thematic staples of the film, and pain and trauma aren't to be sugar coated for that.

"Interesting - but 1.) I agree your thoughts of the guardians and StarLord. Did him dirty reversing his character ark then dusted him like that 2.) ok a real disagreement -  I think of this movie as half a movie and that sha-plumps the logic of your narrative structures.. well slightly - so the snap began a really long intermission. 
3.) As one who has my BA is psychology (most useless degree ever) EXcept now - in this moment..here.. nooow - the Thanos abuse stuff well I do get that yet it is almost universally recognized that one aspect of the psychological profile of an abuser is that in a twisted and megalomaniac kind of way, they genuinely care about their victims. That’s why the trauma creates a loop where the victim feels for the abuser and you get what is called  “battered wife syndrome” It is a disturbing psychological incongruence that does happen - yet in no way justify any abuse at all ever - please do not read what I wrote to justifying such things. Thanos with his deeply Nietzschian  worldview and quantitative utilitarian ethic emotionally plays out just as they have showed him. I found it disturbing because it was so accurate. My point is the psychology is sound even if the messaging may be off - but I don’t think it is. Even though he is the protagonist narratively anyone watching except maybe my uncle joe (he actually has been under a rock for years) knows Thanos is the big baddy. Thus all his actions should be understood in a negative light 4.) rating system in place for a reason - a 13 year old and older can get such Nuance. If kids see it younger than it’s on the adult who took them to see it. The rating system is for a reason (OK I can see the hate coming - I will crawl into a hole now) 

Ps. Love your channel - agree with you 68.7% of the time - Your videos make me have “feelings” 100% of the time. And I genuinely experience a deep gratitude for you and your work - the words seem to light but I will say it anyway - Thank You!! Keep up the good fight!!",2,2,2018-09-01T03:41:48.000Z

"I disagree, I disagree, I disagree.  How the hell is Quill responsible for Gamora death? 
How Quill acts is a progression of his character, no journey is a straight line, he let people in, let himself care, took responsibility for them, let himself be vulnerable and when she asked him for death (his worst nightmare, his greatest failure), he didn't look away, he didn't run, he faced it, looked her right in the eyes and pulled the trigger, because otherwise, it would be too terrible to name.
 And then bubbles. A joke a laugh, torturing them for the fun of it.
 She was taken away, she might be tortured but he has a chance of seeing her again, because He didn't let her die. And then Quill finds out, not only was it for nothing, he got what he wanted and she still died. Quill did everything RIGHT and she still died, and Thonos WON. and then Thanos has the gall to be sad, to feel one inch as he does. OF COURSE he regresses, yes I'm disappointed but I understand, that wasn't about being a manchild it was about being human and despite working on your flaws you can still surcome to them.

And the relationship between Gamora and Thanos is complicated. Abusive relationships are complicated, there is often still love in them. Twisted and painful but still love. T.L.D.R if Loki and Odin can feel love for another, so can Gamora and Thanos.
He raised her, taught her, made her everything she is, she lived and did so many terrible things for his smile, sometimes he was even sweet and kind, ""it couldn't all be a lie "" just because she knows how bad it was doesn't make it go away, logic only goes so far.
Thanos is crazy, but human. An extremist gone too far, working off a delusion. 
In his mind, he found a starving child that had sprit and out of curiosity and pity took her away, made her a princess, taught her to be strong to never be helpless again, took pride in her achievements, took solace out of her belief in him, in this plan. Then she leaves, starts working against him, against all they believed in and it Hurts . But he still loves this favourite unexpected child. Still the plan must succeed he is so close so has been so much pain, and he will stop it, and for the greater good he sacrifices what means most to him, his favourite child the one that stood up to him, never disappointed him.
In another story, for a different cause, Thanos would be heroic. How many stories end with the hero sacrificing who they love for the world. Eg. So many were mad that Joel didn't make that diseasion to let Elly Die in the Last of Us.",127,7,2018-09-01T03:02:02.000Z

"Mikey you are right Thanos is a bad guy and we should not follow his example. We should fight people like him. It is a movie where the abuser won,  but don't worry there is hope, there is a part two. 

Everyone is the hero of their own story. And I agree that Thanos plans are very dumb. If anyone thinks that it was a good plan they are wrong. That said you can empathize with him because you realize he, Thanos, believes its true. From his perspective he is the hero, doing the hard thing. From our sane perspective he is a crazy man doing crazy things. 

You feelings are valid of course, that is what you felt when you watched the movie. This was not a happy movie, being sad afterwards is a normal reaction. I can only recommend the 2nd part, as it will probably be very therapeutic (well as much a big budget blockbuster can be). Since I guess watching this crazy abuser get his comeuppance and seeing his wrongs righted will be a very good time had by all.

"I think most comments already made most of the good points, so I'm just gonna add to it that, Marvel movies are constructed so that anyone can find something of interest in their films. From Spider-man to Guardians of the Galaxy, to Thor, to Thor Ragnarok etc.
They are similar, but deal with different characters and different themes. 
With that said, I think you misinterpreted most of Infinity war, and that you are taking Thanos to be something more than what he truly is. It's not what Thanos does that makes him so interesting, it's the conviction and the manner he takes on this crusade that makes him not a RELATABLE, but a more interesting and deep villain. Now I will like to mention the fact that you published a video, showing and explaining an opinion to an audience, and then you closed the feedback that this audience could have potentially given you. I think that was a HUGE fuckup from your part, you shouldn't treat your audience like this, if you really can't trust us to handle these subjects then you should probably start to change your formats, this  is what annoys me from modern media platforms. There is no more trust and respect for the audiences' opinions and comments, it's like everyone took it up to themselves to decide what can and can't be discussed. I don't really find the video upsetting, it's this immediate reaction to take away the voice of your audience into a video that has some controversial themes that really left me with a bitter taste...

Edit: You do have some points though, like the lack of correct depiction of mental illness in superhero genre is a bit obvious, but then if you take a brief look at the modern superhero stage, this is as good as it gets (in what Marvel and DC goes, other more independent editorials and studios might have a better take, but I am talking about the main stream superhero stage)
This sounds like a really stupid argument considering Logan, which might be the best superhero film in the last few years, but then Logan is good because it is more of a western than a superhero film...

"I'm just going to be completely and utterly honest here. This video is complete garbage. I had to stop watching 9 minutes in. Hopefully next time you're better.
You're fine to have your opinion and all, fair enough, but really? Infinity War endorsing abusive relationships? What the fuck.
Really from what I'm gathering you wanted the typical cookie-cutter villain who just wants to get the Infinity Stones for the sake of killing half the universe, not for any other reasons, and has no real emotional connections with anyone. At least that's what it sounds like, judging by the way you plainly dislike Thanos as a character.
People have different definitions of love. Thanos loves in his own twisted way. He's the guy that thinks killing half the universe instead of multiplying resources is the right way to do things. He is an absolute psychopath. That's the whole point of him. He isn't normal, he doesn't feel like a normal person does. 
Unhealthy relationships exist in heaps of media. Infinity War isn't going to be the catalyst that justifies abusive relationships. If you think that it endorses abusive relationships, you're taking the message the completely wrong way.

It shows the one of main themes of the movie: failure, that's even Thanos first line in the movie. ""I know what it's like to lose, to feel so desperately that you're right. Yet to fail, nonetheless.""
And if you're going by the ""Marvel movies are for everyone"" argument, can you imagine if Infinity War was built up for all these years, only to be the same quippy shit every Marvel movie has been before? If I go to see a movie built up for a decade and get AoU but with more characters in it, I would've been severely disappointed (though happy because this video wouldn't exist then.)
Also the ""TORTURE"" argument? Iron Man 1, the same movie you make a point with and the first movie of the MCU, has a scene of Tony being tortured. Hm.
ALSO also: ""It reminded me of bad things that happened to me"". So are all movies with torture or worse triggering for you? Is TDK bad? Is IM1 bad? Is Logan bad? okay.

My point is they are getting the wrong message from it. None of the characters besides his henchmen believe he is doing the right thing.

"That point about abuse = love is very dumb. Abuse is a lot more complex than that and I commend Marvel for at least trying to delve into that in Infinity War. 

The movie makes a point to state that Thanos is a monster with a flawed and twisted ideology. We have seen world leaders have these types of dangerous ideas pop up in history all the time and it leaves untold devastation and misery for the population. Thanos is like that and the movie goes to show that his conviction is stronger than all of the Avengers in this conflict. If anything it tries to convey the dangers of blindly following an ideology. 

Like you said, it culminates 18 movies into this one to be a big climax, we know who the heroes are, they don't need explanation in Infinity War (stating that's a flaw is really dumb). But we did need to know who Thanos was, and making him the protagonist makes the film work. We have seen many films have a morally corrupt protagonist, it's only new for a big film like this.",6,0,2018-09-01T01:07:19.000Z
"As a break from the abuse discussion, I'd like to make some points about the maths of eliminating half the universe.

Firstly, killing off half the population at random wouldn't mean that half the population survives. If one lorry goes out of control, it can block a motorway for hours and wipe out multiple cars and their drivers and passengers. What happens when half the world's lorries are suddenly driver-less? How long do power-plants keep providing electricity when half their current shift are suddenly gone, half the replacements are also gone, and most of the rest can't get to work because the roads are impassable. And how much coal do they have stockpiled? Think of the chain that gets food from the fields to your mouth. How many links in that chain will be broken? And how long will it take for an organised response to clear key transport links, and arrange for supplies to start coming in? FEMA's also been hit. There's no untouched regions to start providing support and leadership from. By the time the dust settles, and things are stabilised, that 1% survival rate may not seem so crazy.

Secondly, reducing the population isn't the same as turning the clock back - for starters, dropping the population to bronze age levels wouldn't remove the knowledge of how to work iron, or how electricity works, or any of millions of technological advancements from the last few few thousand years. And that's before considering the social and psychological consequences of mass death - look at the social upheavals in Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries following a 30%-60% reduction in population.

In the movie, Thanos says that Gamora's homeworld is now a utopia as a result of his attack teaching them the value of life - the obvious question is whether he knows it through having gone back to check (or sent reliable witnesses to come back and tell him the truth rather than what he wanted to hear) or if that's just what he believes/was told by unreliable witnesses who knew what he wanted to hear. Taken purely at face value, it is evidence that, at least within the bounds of the MCU, Thanos was right (at least about the impact of his plan for the next couple of decades - the long term consequences are anybody's guess). Of course, if it's not true then it's more evidence that Thanos is deluded.

Anyway: the finger-snap is only the beginning of the death toll, not the end; and resetting the population level doesn't mean resetting history - instead, a dramatically reduced population level combined with modern technology would give us the ability to recover population at a staggering rate - a hundred-fold increase could plausibly happen in around a century (that's looking at less than quadrupling every generation - or an average of less than 8 children per couple) - or we could stabilise at the new level and stay approximately steady pretty much indefinitely... What's fairly certain is that we won't just reprise population levels from history.",0,0,2018-09-01T01:05:25.000Z
"I agree with most of the points you made. I wonder if you watched Film Theory's take on ""Why Thanos was right"" - it makes some good points, but ultimately Thanos's plan would fail for other reasons. Essentially, he points out that the world population has been leveling out, not so much due to resource constraints, but due to education and technology changing the way humans behave. Iff this is a universal behavior for intelligent life, cutting the population in half (if that didn't cause societal collapse) could actually lower to peak population level.
Where it fails though is, even if accepting the premise, you'd have to cut each world's population at the point where its technology and society hit the right point of development. Not just slash the whole universe's population all at once.

That's what a father does. Thanos believes he knows best because he's the parent. He sees what his children don't or won't.

"As someone who suffered from abuse, I will say that this movie depicted an abusive relationship in such a raw and honest way. I can understand how this is very difficult for people to absorb, but this movie was so important to me to see. It was such a catharsis. My abuser won. It was such a relief for me to see a movie where the abuser wins. It made me feel not alone. I'm sorry that people saw this and were hurt by it. I wasn't hurt by it.

"Maybe my sensibilities are changing; maybe I'm reaching my superhero-movie-saturation point; but something about this movie felt kind of forced - like all the trauma the characters go through felt more like a decision of the filmmakers than a consequence of what happens in the story.

I care about these characters (it's the main reason I like the MCU) and it feels icky to watch them go through all of this trauma for (what feels like) nothing.

I also really, really, really don't like where they went with Thanos; all that stuff that's supposed to make us ""empathise"" with him feels pasted on.

"This was interesting, but there are some things I don’t agree on. Like while you are right about Peter’s actions on Titan, you also made it sound like he did nothing, but make poor decisions the entire movie when that’s not the case. Like on Knowhere, Peter tried to stop Drax from attacking Thanos and does try to formulate a plan of attack before Gamora rushes Thanos instead. If one wants to say it’s still his fault for not killing Gamora the second she was captured, well, it would take a certain level of not giving a damn to immediately shoot someone that you love. And despite what you said about the Guardians being poorly written, you kind of gloss over the fact after speaking about Quill as you don’t really talk about the other Guardians at all save for Gamora crying over Thanos’ corpse.",0,0,2018-09-01T00:44:08.000Z

"Honestly, the thing that annoyed me the most in the movie was the Gamora sacrifice. It would be better, in my opinion, if 1-it didn't work or 2-the actual sacrifice wasn't the point and the jewel triggered for a different reason. I can't say I relate to being re-traumatized with the bleak tone of the movie, other than offer condolences, but I do recognize that the main problem, in this case, is that heroes are supposed to be symbols, and the movie let go of their positive impact so they can shift narrative focus to go on Thanos's ""hero journey"" and reduce complexity on the narrative - which honestly impressed me the first time I realized it. Also a problem is that if the inconsistencies in the Titan's plan aren't addressed correctly and he is just beaten up on the second movie, it will brush off the actual ideological fallacy of the villain. Somehow I don't think they will take care of that in a satisfying manner or at all.

Ah, on second thought, Peter Quill also annoyed me on this one for the reasons you pointed out. He was set up like this and his reaction during the climax was really predictable. I still enjoyed the movie, but I can only agree they could've avoided some easy mistakes.",0,0,2018-09-01T00:28:32.000Z

"I appreciate how the non-stop grimness of the film is off-putting for a lot of viewers. I will say that I thought it was a significant improvement on the second Avengers film which I found utterly forgettable and where the stakes seemed non-existent. I found this one quite depressing to watch, but am hanging my hopes that they do lift out of the grimness in the follow-up film. Interestingly enough, a lot of your criticisms mirror my thoughts about... The Handmaids Tale! The second season made an art out of torturing viewers with one hopeless, depressing episode after another, with themes that hit a little too close to home for a lot of people. Granted, the audience is much narrower than MCU - probably not a lot of kids watching that one.",0,0,2018-09-01T00:11:43.000Z
"I really respect this take, and I'm pleasantly surprised that this comment section isn't a pit of hellfire. While I disagree with most of what you've said, I'll say upfront that I do agree with your position on all the torture in this movie. It was just too much. It made me too uncomfortable.

That said, I have some things to say. Many others have articulated roughly why I see Thanos as a truly sympathetic (though irredeemable) character, so I won't repeat them here. I want to speak to the issue of Thanos and Gamora in this film. Maggie's point really crystallized this for me: often, abusers are not villains to their victims. I want to explore that situation she described more. What about that same child watching a different movie that depicts abuse? A movie that actively avoids showing the abuser as loving their victim? That child is able to sit in the theater, look a the character on screen and then their real life abuser and see them as being nothing alike. Their real life abuser has love for them, so they cannot be abusive. They aren't the villain, surely. They're not like the villain in the movie. On the other hand, watching infinity war, that child may well look at their abuser and find themselves naturally equating them with thanos, a villain. I think that's a valuable thing for cinema, especially popular cinema, to depict because it's so rare.

That isn't to say that all abusive relationships are also loving. That isn't to say that abusive relationships, especially ones involving minors, are always enabled by the conditioned beliefs of the victim. Those things aren't true for a even a majority of such relationships. But there are a heck of a lot of people out there whose abuse is internally justified, in part, by the picture hollywood paints of all abusers being heartless, unsympathetic monsters. Someone who believes that abuse and love are mutually exclusive might find themselves one day saying something like ""he can't be abusive. I know he loves me."". That is really dangerous, and it happens all the time, and I think that an ultra-high-profile movie directly challenging that can only be a good thing.

I should say that I think infinity war falls slightly short of portraying Thanos and Gamorah properly, in that it never directly rebuts the idea that thanos' love for her is a redeeming feature. That is an important point to make, that you can't use an abuser's love for their victim as a means for them to escape judgement for the terrible things they've done to them.

Can this portrayal of abuse be harmful? Of course. Any portrayal of abuse can be harmful. Abusive relationships are so diverse and individual that you cannot find one portrayal that matches all of them. And someone in an abusive relationship who sees a portrayal of abuse that does not match their own experience is reasonably likely to be harmed by that in some way. Is it then in some sense irresponsible to publicly portray abuse? Yes. Does that mean we should never portray it?

PS., to some other commenters: if your position is that someone's intense negative reaction to a film because of prior trauma is ""Film is supposed to make you feel things"", please... re-think whether by ""feeling things"" you mean to include ""being actively harmed"".",0,0,2018-09-01T00:07:39.000Z

Also, I feel like all the social/political negative implications of Thanos' outlook on life/evil plan are curbed by the fact that he's the villain. There's all this hype about how he thinks he's right, but he's ultimately going to be proven wrong, no one of the things he does is supposed to be positive, he's not a role model, he's a bad guy.",0,0,2018-08-31T23:54:08.000Z

I don't come to the same conclusions you do, nor do I think this movie wasn't made for everyone. Sometimes films deal with uncomfortable subject matter and they should, pretending they don't exist - even if you're a marvel film - does the audience a disservice. 

I have friends who suffer from depression and anxiety, who have had arguably abusive upbringings that walked out of this movie loving it. Who didn't even mention that the torture or abuse was too much or implied the wrong message. I don't take the people who say 'Thanos was right' seriously. It comes across as another meme inspired by the satirical phrase 'Hitler did nothing wrong' often wielded by internet trolls.

"I never thought of Empire during either of the times I watched Infinity War. My mind went to Deathly Hallows pt2. We already know all of these people; like you said near the end, Mikey, it’s the event, not the story. 

Be that as it may I can understand the necessity for story regardless. We see glimpses of it with each of the characters when they have their moments and that’s all they are: moments. 

Completely agree with you on Quill. In my head I rewrote that scene to be he and Nebula grabbed onto each other and glared into others eyes- not romantic, not feeling some deep connection, but single tear of pure hatred coming out as they need to reign in their fury for Just one more minute before they try (and most likely fail) to kill a god. 

Speaking of whom- this is the first time I’m hearing that Thanos and his dynamics were seen in this light. The entire time I never thought of him as a sympathetic person who’s secretly an abuser. I thought of him as so set in his ways you can’t pull him back. Making another Deathly Hallows reference- he is beyond saving. 

“Love” may not have been what he felt for Gamorra (though he’d disagree) but maybe some twisted form of affection? Synonymous with how someone feels for a pet or treasured memento? 

I’ll admit I’m one of those fans who shrug off Thanos’s actions to be his moniker; but it felt more of an evolution of the “mad genius” motif than anything else. 

I wonder if the writers took more cues from cult leaders and their early lives before the mass suicides happen- focus on Thanos being megalomaniacal and focused on his own legacy rather than “the greater good.” Make him more Grindelwald and less Dumbledore.",0,0,2018-08-31T23:29:51.000Z

Not only that, in her sister's eyes their ausive parent made Gamora complicit in said abuse.

This movie is a halfway point. Much like I was let down by LOTR The Two Towers when I first saw it, but now the whole series is released it seems much better.

Why anyone thought it was going to be an upbeat movie when we KNOW that many heroes aren't making it out of this endgame confuses me.

It had to be dark, they have been building up Thanos from day one. If he was just a generic bad guy people would be pushing the ""marvel can't do bad guys other than Loki lolololol"" line.

     If you did the same to the Elves of Middle Earth, then you have probably killed off that race for good (okay, not sure about the fertility of the Elves, but any race that only produces children at a low rate).

     The problem was that the movies wanted to make movie Thanos different from Comic Thanos, who simply wanted to impress his girlfriend, Death Herself.  By making him more of a 'thoughtful' character, they also left a HUGE 'plot hole':  Why not simply say ""Enough for Everybody, Everywhere, Forever"".

"I think the biggest disagreement I have is that the MCU itself isn't really marketed towards children? Do kids like superheroes? Definitely. Do kids play with marvel toys? Yep. But when you look at the movies (at least in my opinion), these versions of the characters are made for teens and adults. These movies haven never been the most mature or the deepest, but deep issues have usually been at the forefront, just simplified. I mean Iron Man with ptsd from Avengers, Cap trying to fit in a future world, Widow dealing with her past, Thor having a complicated relationship with his brother, and I'm not even going into the morality issues of Civil War or the controversial issues of Black Panther.
My point is, these movies have characters that kids enjoy, they have a bit of branding towards kids outside the movies, and kids can like most of them. But at the heart of it, these are not movies aimed towards children. They are action movies aimed towards adults with bright colors. Spider Man and maybe Ant Man are the only movies I can think of that seems geared towards a younger audience. It's a parent's choice to let their child go to these movies, and while most of the time that is perfectly fine, I don't think it's fair to limit a film maker's vision on a movie because there is a younger audience that wasn't necessarily intended. I mean, looking at the first couple (Iron Man and Hulk), there are definitely show that these movies were not originally for kids.
Overall, I love your critique on this, love your channel, everything. But I feel like you almost had too simplistic views of some of this stuff. Thanos is the bad guy, so he needs to be BAD. His plan is inherently WRONG cuz he's the villain. Abuse is completely black and white. Starlord grew as a character so there's no way he could've emotionally hit someone who killed the girl he loved. I feel like this movie just tried hard to cover some intense, complex stuff, and you're taking those complexities, simplifying them, and saying that they're mistakes.

"To me, the vital component of this film that is often overlooked is how it actually takes cues from Guardians Volume 2. If we look at Ego, it becomes very clear that this is a universe whose conception of love accepts murdering a ‘loved one’ to accomplish a larger goal. What that movie also made clear was that the main characters, the mortal beings trapped in that reality who were thus treated as things to be used, knew it was wrong. That’s what Infinity War built on. Gamora’s last words were “This isn’t love.” The universe disagrees, but of course it does. We know it does. Guardians 2 taught us the universe doesn’t understand love—it acts in direct opposition to it. Avengers 4 is going to be about the Avengers literally bending the laws of the universe to enact their will on it in order to preserve our values and morality. 

Infinity War was brutal because it was real. It’s the moment we’re in right now. Because, as 2016 taught us, we can lose. Horrifically so. Because the universe doesn’t care. The universe is wired for entropy. But we have to come back stronger. We have to hold true to what we know is right and kind. The only thing that we need to improve is our strategy. We have to come together, in solidarity, stronger than we are separated, and we can win back the world that’s been ruined. Perhaps with sacrifice—but, as Wanda and Vision were meant to symbolize, true love is a WILLING sacrifice. Peter Quill’s punching Thanos in the face made them lose, but it was also a statement of values—using other people for your ends isn’t love. Starlord unknowingly doomed the universe to prove how much that moral stance means to him. 

We didn’t lose because we were wrong. We lost because the cards were stacked against us. Because the Soul Stone offers itself to someone who’s willing to sacrifice someone they claim to love. In a universe like that, we’re playing s rigged game. An evil murderer can very easily get a head-start in a system built in their favor.

But even in that rigged game, Dr. Strange tells us we have a shot. And if you disregard the fact that he knows it had to be done, the way this story ends will only happen because Dr. Strange sacrifices the Time Stone to save Tony. An act of irrational compassion, an act of self sacrifice, is THEE reason the heroes will likely be able to come back winning in the end. That’s not an accident.",1,2,2018-08-31T21:59:51.000Z

"Regarding the ""Thanos has a point..."" thing,
The problem with Thanos' plan isn't that the _plan_ is bad, it's that the problem isn't real. Overpopulation doesn't actually work like that, look up somethnig called the demographic transition model. Populations will go through periods of fast growth as child mortality drops and medicine improves, but the growth rate will eventually come down again as culture changes. Unless something changes drastically, the human population probably won't ever become much bigger than twelve billion, which is far from the maximum carrying capacity for Earth's resources, let alone the solar system. It's not that Thanos has a bad plan or that Thanos is insane or whatever. The movie is saying that he's accurately diagnosed a problem with population growth. He has not. The fact that a lot of people think this 1800's Malthusian eugenicist garbage ""has a point"" is honestly fucking terrifying.

"I wouldn't necessarily say it's Abuse=Love. I mean, there are multiple times in the movies where it explicitly says or shows that Thanos is not a good person or a good father. What he did, specifically to Nebula and Gamora, was obviously wrong and portrayed as such. To me it was more character building. This dark, evil character, who is psychotic, dangerous, and abusive, was just made waaaay more complex by showing he has a ""human"" side. He does feel emotions, even if they are seriously screwed up. The film never justifies Thanos inherently. True, it does show him as the protagonist, but it never says what he's doing is right. However, it does allow for the question of ""is this right"". And as others have said, a lot of times abusers do love the people they abuse in a twisted sort of way. My complaint is that it was almost too realistic for the plot it was portraying, but I think it's fine.
I just think it wasn't necessarily trying to justify him or to say Thanos was a good person, I think it just has complex character and story building that is a bit mature for younger audiences.",0,0,2018-08-31T21:46:49.000Z

Sometimes you have to say something in literature/art/film that WILL be misinterpreted by a sizeable chunk of the audience. People think Agamemnon obeyed the gods or showed his willingness to do his duty and uphold his honor but that is exactly the wrong lesson to take from it. I think the same thing about Thanos and yeah, some people will watch it and come out thinking Thanos is right or should be emulated but I still support the directors' intent (or at least what they seem to be trying to say).

You should be able to empathize and understand the actions of anyone, even evil people that are completely morally wrong and reprehensible AND a timeless lesson that being good is more important than doing the ethical thing or something you believe is right if it brings about harm to other people.",0,0,2018-08-31T21:10:31.000Z

Okay I must admit I didn't saw that correlation that Abuse = love and I feel dumb for not seeing it. The only possible defense I can think about it is that well Marvel had already said that exact same message in GOTG 2 with Yondu. Now the thing I disagree is that Quill acted out of character. He didn't do anything wrong before well he fucked up everything. The worst thing you can say is that he was jealous of Thor I guess. And about the the fucking up everything his reaction was exactly the same as in GOTG 2 when he discovered Ego killed his mom. So yeah I wouldn't say it was out of character. And now I didn't understand why you though the stakes were artificially elevated but in any case the fact that this movie has such big stakes doesn't mean that Marvel is going to dish out smaller scale conflicts this has been proven by Ant man and the wasp.,0,1,2018-08-31T21:03:04.000Z

You said it yourself, after 18 movies the stakes had to be appropriately high or the movie would not have worked. Thanos had to be a threat of universal proportions. But guess what? Just because Thanos won doesn't mean he was right. Just because he's the protagonist doesn't mean the movie was justifying his actions and ideals. You are meant to understand his motives, and that he himself is convinced he's the good guy and that his path is righteous, but at no point does the movie ask you to side with him.

"See, when I first saw Infinity War, I actually felt like Gamora was the protagonist -- because I felt like it was ultimately the story of her abuser coming back to haunt her in the most exaggerated, universe-smashing, horrifying way. And the movie kind of felt like what it can FEEL like when an abuser smashes their way back into your life. And I liked that even after she was dead, the movie made it clear that Thanos still fears her judgement. I was all there for it, until. . . well, like you said. It's very clear that the people who made this movie see Thanos as the protagonist, and tried really hard to make him empathetic. And there's just too much goddamn discourse about ""Oh, Thanos was right! He had a point! He's the real protagonist!"" And I'm starting to think that I was so eager to read the movie as feminist/progressive/whatever that I may have given the creators too much credit. I still really like the movie, but I totally understand people who hate it for the way it clearly romanticizes an abuser. (Oh and also I totally agree that the beginning completely undoes the emotional+thematic spine of Thor: Ragnarok but that's a whole nother comment)",6,4,2018-08-31T20:40:56.000Z

Now it seems times have changed, you didn't care for this movie and several reviewers who I've watched who are tired of Marvel movies loved it. So clearly Marvel movies are not for everyone.

"""That's not the way mental illness works"" 

Yeah, because mental illness always manifests the same way from everyone who suffers from it.  Sure thing there, chief.

Also, I have to disagree with your take on Thanos and Gamora in the same way many others do here.  I think he genuinely loved Gamora, but his obsession with bringing stability to the universe and the lengths he had to go to in order to achieve that goal always took precedence.   People can become so enveloped in what they believe to be their respective destinies that they will be willing to do anything, even the most heinous of deeds, to ensure those destinies come to pass.  Even those as important as their own children can become obstacles or sacrificial lambs to be eliminated to aid towards their greater goal.  I think Thanos is sane enough to know that what he does to Gamora is the worst thing a father can do to his child, but he's also insane enough to believe that he has no choice.",4,0,2018-08-31T20:32:31.000Z
"I loved your video and you touched upon a lot that I didn't consider as far as the abuse angle, but I feel in focusing so much on that and the oppressive tone of the movie you missed out on a deeper message.
A few of the reasons why I enjoyed the movie are detailed in Movie Bob's video here I'd suggest you watch it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLvux3kpu1o&t=638s before reading the rest of my comment.
Over the decades'  cinema has existed to tell stories and in many, there's a consistent expectation of the Hero winning and the Villain losing. I remember sitting in the theater just waiting for the Avengers to turn the table on Thanos someway somehow, even as Scarlet Witch followed through on sacrificing vision and she's crying her eyes out in the dirt Thanos just turns back the clock rips out the Mind Stone he came for, and at this moment Thor crashes in to meet the man that wronged him but he's far too enamored with stroking his own ego with the ""Gotcha!"" thang when he should have ""Aimed for the head."" and in that instant he FAILED... Thanos snaps his fingers and the rest is history.
The moral of this story is; sometimes the Bad Guy wins to horrendous results because good people are too divided over petty **** to realize there are greater problems than what is between each other and think THAT is something we all need to keep in mind. It's hard not to see the parallels between the Trump Administration and its supporters, even after everything they still follow him because their Idea of what is right is either so warped or they don't understand there's another way that could be found. Thanos' mindset is especially unnerving ""I alone am willing to do what is necessary to fix it.""
Your supposed to feel revolted that someone like Thanos has been able to become this powerful, not only Physically but also charismatically.
And to me, all this is what makes Infinity War so impactful. The best stories are the ones that hit you where you live and make you reflect upon your life in some way, unsettle you with its Sympathetic characters or force is to face a point of view that some have and will act upon for what they believe could bring about a better world.

there is a factor in the speed of population growth and it is the advancement of a species it goes like this if you don't count in war and stuff
the more advance they get the less they feel the need to procreate and it will get to a place that the growth nearly stops and they only replace the population 
for example with 7 billion people now the estimation is we will have about 15 billion but if in this point and time there was 3.5 billion people it would be stopped some were around 10 :/

"Great video as always, I especially love getting the fresh perspective on this film.

I find it odd that the things you don't like about this film are the things I thought were portrayed especially well. Gamora's relationship with Thanos is heart wrenching because you can't just deny someone's feelings exist because their actions are incongruous. People are incongruous, love is messy and fucked up sometimes, and showing he did truly care for Gamora points out to me that you can't justify actions with love in the way a lot of movies do. Quill tried to kill her out of love, and Thanos succeeded, and the contrast is a big freaking deal. THAT is why Thanos is 'Mad', he can't understand how his responses to his feelings aren't the same as other people, so he calls others naive.

And Gamora broke down after stabbing Thanos because he raised her; abusive, toxic, but the relationship was real, it was her whole life.

As for Quill, killing a loved one is kinda his bezerk button. This is incredibly consistent across all 3 films. Really I think they nailed the Guardians almost completely. Except for Drax, who went from red-hot vengeance seeking in Vol.1, to mr. jokester. He barely even mentioned his family when he went up against the guy he holds responsible for their death, too busy making 'wacky misunderstandings'.",0,0,2018-08-31T20:08:56.000Z

I do have one small gripe about the being picky about Thano's and his capability for love. He adopted his ""Children"", he raised them, he sheltered them. In his mind he was caring for children who's parents were on the wrong side of the equation. So YES, I do believe that he was capable of LOVE and that he truly loved Gamora. If you can accept a Space pirate loved a child who he kidnapped, that he could have returned home instead of keeping on board, why can't you accept that someone even as Mad as the Titan can love. Thanos is probably the BEST CG character ever. You can see it in his face when he talks about his home world, what happened to it, his choices he's made since. He was numbing himself to the deaths he was causing, but not the lives that were left in his wake.

"You Sir are very wrong about Thanos!  Yes he is definitely a villain! He is a MONSTER!. He did completely unforgivable things!  He was how ever at one point a victim.  He is the only surviving member of his race. He saw the inevitable doom of his people and he tried to convince them to do something about it and they completely ignored him.  That is a tragedy we can't hope to understand.  Sure his method for saving his planet was harsh and maybe even barbaric but, what every they did try obviously didn't work. After his immeasurable tragedy in his now completely broken mind he truly feels that the loss of many if far greater than the loss of all.  I ask you is this not true? Horrible yes! beyond measure but non-the less true.  We lost millions of troupes in WW2 and that loss is tremendous but we did it for what we considered the greater good.  Thanos is doing what he thinks is best for the greater good.  He has been so broken by the loss of his people that he truly believes what he is doing is necessary.  You can see that this isn't what he wants repeatedly through out the move.  He shows compassion by taking in a young Gamora,  crying when he is forced to kill her.  Killing her isn't what he wants to do but its what he has to do in his mind for the greater good.  No one wants to send a loved one to a nursing home when they are no longer capable of taking care of their needs but you have to make a hard decision. they don't want to do it but they believe they are doing the right thing.  Thanos is right!  the universe can only accommodate a finite amount of people for a finite amount of time.  This universe we live in, our actual real world will eventually end and there is nothing we can do to stop it.  the best we can hope for is to prolong our existence in it.  If we however go around like the aliens in independence day wasting resources so we can simply multiply and conquer other worlds our time in this universe will end much more rapidly.  Thanos is simply trying to prolong that inevitable end.  He goes about it completely wrong,  he does unforgivable things, he completely under uses a device that could with the snap of his fingers grant endless resources to the universe.  Remember he is mentally broken from a tragedy we can't begin to understand.  He is actually relatable in this way.  people go through things in life that are horrible and they have to find ways of dealing with it and processing it.  Anyone who has gone through major tragedy has come to that line drawn in the ground.  Most of use see it and step back and find another way to recover from the tragedy.  Others however don't, what ever crossing that line might have been for them once they crossed it they could never come back.  Thanos crossed that line.

As for seeing an abuser showing love and some people thinking that being abused is a sign of love that really is dependent on the person.  I personally have seen a lot of tragedy in my life.  When he threw her off the cliff and she was fighting him the entire time my personal take on that was ""YES!!! YOU FIGHT NO MATER WHAT! YOU FIGHT TILL THE BITTER END! DON'T GIVE UP, DON'T GIVE IN!""  that's what i took away from that.  As for her crying when she thought he was dead, again my personal take on that was that she was crying tears of joy because her tormentor was finally dead and she was free.  I really feel that moment was more like how I imagine a captive person would feel once they were finally free and safe IE: back on American soil or safe in a police station after having been kidnapped.  I'm a fighter I don't like to give up no matter what it is I'm doing (don't ever play board games with me).  My fighter nature was a response to all of my personal tragedies.  I felt I had no choice but to fight back or die trying.  For me and I personally feel for the other fighters out there this movie had a completely different tone.  The tone I got was People or things will get in your way and it may feel like you are in an unwinnable situation but no mater how grim the future may seem you must always keep fighting, keep moving forward.  Even when things go wrong keep trying never stop trying.  We all know the future of this is that everyone survives (maybe not tony, contracts be what they will) and Thanos gets defeated.  This is a two part movie, we have not yet seen the finish line.  I consider the entire world is just in a very long intermission right now.  I don't look at this as a normal movie having a normal 3 act structure to it.  It is simply the first half of very long movie,  how many of your beloved movies would still hold up if you stopped then half way through.

"Hey. Really nice work you did here with this video.
A few things I want to share.
First: you are right about that thing in the beginning, with movies are for everyone. The first time I saw it in the theater, there was this mom with her two boys, maybe aged 10-12. I thought to myself that it's weird for me, a 34 years old woman, to be there. Maybe this whole franchise is for kids. At the end, after crying like crazy in my seat while Spider-Man was dusting away, I was thinking about those boys, how they must have felt. And about their mother, who must have felt awful for taking them (I would have)
Second of all, yes, they did not get the tone of the guardians right. Consider this: they started working on this movie's script at least 3 years before it hit theater... So many things happened in that time. And the dialogue was just awful... I mean, that banter from Drax that Thor was a man, not a dude and many more, felt so forced... I felt like I was watching bad theater live...",0,0,2018-08-31T19:08:12.000Z
"y'now going in to this movie and expecting a movie that in your own word is ""meant for every one"" i can see how you would be disappointing or even uncomfortable by some of the themes and motivations of the what you didn't know going in would be the main character (and i completely agree that certain themes in relation to abuse should have been handled better. as well as the fact that in no way was his plan correct and any rationalization for it would either be false on the very bases of it) I cant say that i myself didn't enjoy it as i myself have always gravitated towards shows, movies and stories what are inherently sad, tragic or just plain shocking emotionally (don't ask why I couldn't tell you) and this hit that mark for me. though in the end i would like to point out two things that i took away from the movie.
one. as you said at 18:21  ""there's no story, its an event not a narrative"" that is exactly what it is, an event, some thing that comic books have been doing for many years and done many times to great success. in these events a few or even many characters tend to die for any number of reasons. (mostly shock value, like the death of superman or captain america) though we comic book fans have long accepted that it wont last forever and they will be back. wouldn't be overly surprised if that's what happens here. another reason i see this as an event is mostly due to the fact that events have 
often been used to ""reset"" the universe continuity to a simpler point and start again and as you brought up where are they gonna go after this. (I don't think its just chance that many of the original actors were the ones to survive the ""purge"" when they're contracts are ending soon as a treat of this level seems a good way too send off beloved actors and begin to differentiate them from their characters)
two. One of my main take always from you're ""how we see star wars"" videos was that you shouldn't judge or make to many opinions for a trilogy (or in this case a two part movie) before the whole thing has been released as what see now may later be expanded on or our perception of it will change based on any new information we receive.",1,0,2018-08-31T19:07:38.000Z

"What I took from the Thanos / Gamora matter as it was handled in this movie, being someone who works in mental health and has worked with clients going through or dealing with the aftermath of abusive relationships, isn't that ""abuse = love"" but rather that ""abuse =/= not love"". That is, just because someone is abusive doesn't mean they don't love, and just because someone is abused doesn't mean they don't love. Abusive relationships are complicated, and there are multiple reasons they can be hard to leave. More importantly, it shows that love alone is not enough to make a relationship okay, healthy, or even survivable. Did Thanos love Gamora? Apparently - he got the Soul Stone, after all. Did Gamora love Thanos? In some way, as she cried over killing him before seeing it was an illusion. Was their love enough to make their relationship healthy? Obviously not, because Thanos killed her in the end. That itself can be an incredibly difficult but important message - if you're in an abusive relationship, and you believe genuinely that your abuser loves you and you love them, that's not enough to make the relationship not dangerous to you.

To be perfectly blunt, ""love conquers all"" is a dangerous and pervasive notion. It really gets put out there a lot, and it is that notion that primarily drives some victims of abuse to stay in an abusive relationship. Love is powerful, and it is a wonderful thing in /healthy/ /context/. But it won't save someone from abuse until they love themselves enough to leave an abuser. Even Thanos was hurt by what he did, despite feeling he had to, and that's tragically not unrealistic. Abusers, too, will not be saved from the consequences of their own abusive behavior just because they love the person they abuse. Not unless and until they find it a reason to change.

Walking away (in cases of danger, such as with physical abuse or relationships trending that direction) and getting therapy as appropriate (in all cases) is the answer to abuse, for both the abuser and the victim. Love alone won't make it okay. It's a hard truth, but it's even harder to see someone trapped in a dangerous relationship because they believe in the love there and are convinced that love will fix it before it reaches a tragic conclusion.",185,7,2018-08-31T19:04:31.000Z

"You always seem so intelligent in your previous videos, but you've made a lot of assumptions in this one. Without the second part, in a continuous storyline, then making conclusions based on half a story isn't going to stick. The whole point of the film wasn't to follow heavy storythreads. It is an event narrative. It doesn't presume to be empire. It's itself Mikey. Having the previous movies made following the characters based off all their previous storylines an invisible strength. We've followed up until now. its been win after win. These were the questions - why do the avengers exist? should they? is it a good idea to keep doing these movies?

"I think at least one thing you didn't get right: you don't need to be right to believe in something - which of course Thanos does with all his heart. That's what makes him empathetic and complex - not that his plan is supposed to make sense. I didn't see the blue ray commentary but I think you mixed that one up - even though I might be totally wrong about it. 
Also to view love as this singular thing is not healthy for any human being who wants to enjoy any longterm relationship. It wouldn't make sense for this movie if the universe judged anyone whether his or her feeling is actually love but instead it's only important whether this being feels love no matter what this means for anyone else. Yeah this also opens up the possibility of harmful love or whatever you want to call it to be included in the definition of this single word 'love' but if you want to measure this movie to reality this depiction holds up much better than any other approach. Romantic love is such a stupid thing in society - at least to me. I dont know where I heard it but in I think it was in ancient Greek where to love someone meant more like ""to want to learn about someone specific and teach that person about yourself""  
Well anyway its always good to hear another opinion on anything but usually your analysis go more in depth and kind of make more sense. I mean I think I understand your point and that it just wasn't for you but then why didn't other movies make you feel the same way? Star wars is abhorrent as it teaches a philosophy that justifies every evil doing with the dark side: ""ahh it's not him. he was just seduced by the dark side. usually he loves dancing and cuddling with puppies...""",0,0,2018-08-31T19:01:26.000Z

"I'm a fan of your videos, however like what seems like most of my fellow ""commentors"", I couldn't disagree more with your take on the concept of ""love"" in this film. One aspect of love that you don't seem to take into account is that love is messy and more often than not, NOT black and white. It was at the point in the video where you question whether or not Gamora loved Thanos (citing the scene where she stabs him and weeps for him, though this is a fabricated reality of Thanos's creation) that I began to see that you have a bit of a skewed viewpoint on the types of relationships that exist that can be considered ""loving"". Yes, Thanos was a twisted murdering sociopath, however Gamora as a character has always (in the films) been conflicted in her relationship with him, beginning in Guardians 1. It is possible that she loved him. He raised her for most of her life and treated her as special, nurturing her into the ""fiercest woman in the galaxy"". The film, The Truman Show, comes to mind as I write this because there is a line that has always stuck with me. ""We accept the reality with which we are presented."" Gamora is the embodiment of this philosophy in AIW. While she did learn to hate Thanos in time, for the majority of her life he was her guardian (no pun intended). I argue that the relationship there between what is essentially an abusive father figure and an adopted child is more complicated than you present and that love takes many forms, not always a clear cut distinction between love and hate. Sometimes its a combination of both and sometimes love and hate are more similar to each other than we, as humans, care to admit. And THAT is what I argue is one of the defining morals of this film.",0,0,2018-08-31T18:46:20.000Z

"Everybody gets the whole ""Thanos is the protagonist of Infinity Wars"" thing, but did you also get that his ""Destroy Half of All Life"" plan and his ""True Love for Gamora"" thing were supposed to not make sense?

Every child in the world can point out that Thanos's villain plan makes no sense. It's literally and figuratively a crazed Supervillain plan. What makes it dangerous is that Thanos believes in it. And we see the devastating results, Just as Thanos believes himself to Love Gamora, and we see the equally disastrous results.

Of Course Thanos doesn't love Gamora. He tortured her, murdered her family, abducted her, and genocided her species.

What's dangerous is Thanos Believing he Loves Gamora. 
The Soul Stone Reacts to Belief not Love. He sacrificed the thing he believed he loved. And that Belief was *real to him*. It's intended to articulate that he's so single minded it worked. He obtained the Stone.

That was supposed to be the Tip-Off for his character though: Thanos is Insane. Like Actually Insane. He's a Genocidal War-Monger with Delusions of Grandier (in case Squidward's opening Speech to Thanos wasn't also a give away, ""The Might, The Majesty, Etc.""), and his unwillingness to compromise on things the world around him realize is insane is what makes him dangerous. He believes utterly that he's in the right.

And there's more to sink into here about the meta-narrative Infinity Wars is attempting to discuss. The nature of Fatherhood and Masculinity (Two Major themes of the MCU not to Mention Infinity Wars). I could discuss, how Thanos is intended to represent Weaponized Masculine Entitlement, or how he's a deconstruction of the Solitary White Man with a Mission trope that make him a reflection of all previous MCU protagonist archetypes.

But Mostly, I just want people to stop complaining that Infinity Wars Equated Love with Abuse, because it really didn't.

"Sorry, but I just cannot agree with most of your points. Aside from perhaps the Ant-Man films, most of these movies are not designed for young kids. The stakes have always been relatively high, with world-ending or dystopian consequences, and plenty of death and destruction result from the actions of both the villains and heroes. While you seem to make a big deal about the abusive relationship of Thanos and his daughters, you don't seem to have a problem with the rather dark subject matter common in most of these films. Why isn't the same level of hand-wringing applied to Peter killing his father, Tony Stark dealing with the guilt of creating an AI that almost wiped out humanity, the maiming of War Machine, the attempted fascist surveillance state, the destruction of New York City, or anything else? I find it rather strange that you draw the line at Thanos - a villain who believes what he is doing is right, yet still has to deal with the pesky emotions of knowing that his actions will most likely kill the few people he still cares about.

As far as where we go from here, it doesn't really matter. This iteration of Marvel characters that we have all grown to love aren't going to be around forever, because their actors are getting older and don't want to play these roles forever. Likewise, there's no telling if the popularity for this franchise will last much longer. Some argue that we have already hit peak Marvel.

"The trauma stuff is deep and heavy, and I get it. I think one thing you may have overlooked is that a lot of people sympathize with hurting people they care about, and live in world/family where abuse and love are not exclusive concepts, but messy piles of feelings, and generally involve dumb plans. It seems as though you make a case that Thanos being wrong or cruel makes him less sympathetic, less human, and that POV is at least as scary as the idea that population concerns can be solved with the snap of a finger. I get the movie seems to support Thanos, but the whole thing is framed as his victory being a unilaterally bad thing. The movie itself asks 'where do we go from here?' and acts like it hasn't already promised an answer, even though, as you said, every adult knows better. And so it's hard to tell what trauma is 'justified' and what the overall message is without Part 2.

"Yay comments are enabled. First time I saw the video they weren’t. Alright can’t say shit about abuse, never been abused and never abused. Not my field of expertise, on the other hand criminals, terrorist, and the criminally insane totally in my wheelhouse. Thanos isn’t “crazy or psychotic” he’s narcissistic not unlike Tony Stark or Doctor Strange, but he’s an eco-terrorist. And like all terrorist he has a doctrine that drive him, and if you don’t follow the doctrine he’ll teach that lesson again. So if Earth or any other plant in the Universe didn’t follow his doctrine afterwards he would just go back and teach them the lesson again. The only time Thanos kills outside his doctrine is for the Stones, Vision and Gamora. Everything else is half must die for half to survive. Loki, Hulk, Heimdall, and Thor were on the half the ship that was to die. Proof is in when Thanos used the power stone to disintegrate the remainder of the ship. All his other conflicts, the fight on Knowhere, Titan, and Earth no one else was killed by his hand. Until the snap.

However, what I didn't pick up on, is the abuse. This is a very good point that you make, Mikey. So many times, the abuser IRL, sees what they did as harsh, but necessary, and the abusee tends to come around to seeing said abuse the same way. As an abused kid, I tend to do the very same, and saw someone who was just harsh, but did what they thought was right. Evaluating it with the curtain drawn and with abuse in mind, that particular aspect of the film and the character is hot garbage.

"As someone who grew up in a verbally abusive household, the movie just sorta felt real to me. 

I am still to this day conflicted about my relationship with them. It seems on the surface to be better and mostly functional. I don’t know if it should be. I don’t know that I should forgive them. Idk. I guess holding grudges isn’t natural for me though 

I do genuinely believe that my parents love and loved me. At the same time though, we treated each other like dirt and had multiple domestics with police involved. Even after getting into shouting matches or physical fights, I would still feel bad and want them to love me. I actually really related with Gamorrah in that moment you point out. I have definitely said some things that were as deeply cutting as possible. Things meant to hurt and cut to the bone and had a strange moment of awareness where my heart was breaking while i did it, but I kept on cause I wanted to hurt him for hurting me. I always wanted to cry after those.

You can be a shitty person and show that love in a shitty way. That love doesn’t necessarily redeem anything. Thanos is still a horribly misguided and evil piece of dogshit. He can be that and love Gammorha. Neither precludes or absolves the other, it just adds complexity.

He’s not right. He’s not worthy of sympathy or empathy. He’s a sociopath. That’s what i took from it anyway. Him loving his daughter doesn’t change any of that.

So with that said, I don’t think this movie stands on its own. Those things i listed are not the text. I think it needs part 2 to actually prove some of those things then. That’s what you’re supposed to cling to when shit gets this dark. You gotta hold hope. That the bad guy will loose, that the good guys will prevail, that it only posits a theory to prove it wrong in the next one through the vehicle of its ideological and physical clash between characters. My opinion of this movie is going to heavily depend on what happens in the next one and how well they execute that. Maybe that makes this one a failure? I’m not sure.

I understand it, my first reaction was also to hate it because of how it ended and how Starlord acts. I get it it's hard and depressing but that it promotes abuse is just wrong. Thanos is represented as a highly psychopathic being and his abusive relationship to Gamora shows it even more. It portrays the complicated relationship between abusive parents and their tortured children right imo. I mean they always have some sort of bond even though they are being mistreated. It's the only ""family"" they have known. Call it stockholm syndrome or whatever but this sort of behaviour was observed by psychologists for a long time.

"I respect your point of view, and you adress lots of relevant points that need to be discussed. However, I would like to comment particularly on the moment you ask if Gamora loves Thanos, as if that is an impossible thing. It is not. In fact, there are countless cases in which a person loves the abuser, despite the abuse. Gamora grew up having Thanos as a father figure, even if an abusive one and, as we don't know the whole story, I supose that, as with every case of abuse, there were good moments, especially considering that Gamora was ""his favoutire daughter"". Mind me, I am not, by any means, delegitimizing her suffering, it was terrible, and the movie frames it as so, but that doesn't mean that Gamora didn't feel any kind of love for her abusive parent. She does love Thanos, and it's clear to me that she realizes that and hates herself for that love, because she knows she shouldn't feel it. And when she ""kills"" him, she breaks because even though she does what is ""right"", she feels the pain of losing a loved one. And that is understandable, and something you can't control. That felt real.

One other thing I would like to adress is that I believe that the framing of Thanos' claim as a legitimate one comes from the fact the he is te protagonist. Even Gamora's death is framed that way. Her death worked because Thanos believed he loved her, and she was his most precious thing. And maybe she was. There is a comment in this section that states that you are oversimplifying the issue of abuse, and I agree 100%. The thing with love, is that it can't be defined in one simple way. I am, again, not saying that this excuses Thanos' abuse, I'm only stating that there are millions of forms of love, and Thanos feels one of them. One that is toxic and uneccaptable, and it is our job to not tolerate it, and teach people that they shouldn't have to live with it. But, for Thanos, that WAS love. Hence the reason why it worked. The movie his framed to agree with his vision, it is our job as the viewers to dismantle this and support all these people who are fighting him because we know he is wrong, not because the film tells us to, but because we have moral values.

Which brings us to my last point. You are right, this movie is not for everyone. It starts not being for everyone the moment you have to have watched at least some of the previous ones to know one person from the other appart betweeen all that crowd. And, especially, it isn't for children. And that's ok. Not all super-hero movies are for children. 10 years later, Marvel decided to chang the tone for its most important piece, and gave us dark, serious drama. And I particularly like that, while I understand why you haven't.

"As always a superb job, mister! As I just recently heard from another awesome dude, Patrick Willems, we NEED the different points of view when we consume criticism, not just some echo chamber that solidifies what we already believed. In this case, I think that, as many comments here say: 1) we just saw half the story; 2) the infinite variety and intensity of mental disorders does not allow us to say 'abuse and love can't go together in a person's mind', because it can and that's how little we know about human brain and human consciousness; 3) as you always say film is a form of art, and my personal opinion is that art can do whatever it wants when there's a message (whether the viewer/consumer likes it or not), 'cause if we take a notion like 'we must stop this kind of product reaching the masses because it's ugly/sad/depressive/subversive/rude/violent/etcetera' then we're becoming the censors, and censorship it's the worst that can happen to art and thought and I honestly believe it leads to narrower minds and that leads, in the end, to things like bigotry, xenophobia, racism and so on.

The movie understands this as well, considering that it takes the greatest efforts to make sure you know that Thanos, a literal genocidal maniac, IS THE BAD GUY.

Also, I have to push back on the idea that Marvel has “a responsibility” to its audience to portray or not portray abuse in a certain way. Did The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo have a responsibility to not portray the harrowing reality of rape? As soon as we start judging art not by the quality of the craft but by the way it portrays its subject matter according to our own sensibilities, we abandon the creative enterprise wholesale.",592,25,2018-08-31T17:45:17.000Z

"Gamora is crying because you can ""love"" and hate someone. He was all she knew, and the trauma he inflicted was part of an abuse cycle that causes those conflicting feelings. Guilt is a big one, used by abusers as leverage. If she had felt nothing but satisfaction, I wouldn't have believed it.

I found her reaction something I could relate to. The abuse was relatable, painfully so, for someone who was abused. And sometimes the abuser wins, even when they shouldn't. I think Thanos' plan is dumb, and he thinks it's a positive thing, that is something that exists. The idea that abusers know what they do is bad deep down is a misnomer, some do know it's bad, and some really don't understand why it's bad. It depends on what causes the abuser to be an abuser.

"I understand 100% what you are saying about this movie and in a lot of ways I agree. This movie was NOT for children. This movie was NOT for people who have or are still suffering from abuse of this nature.

I am neither of those things. And when I watch Gemora cry after she ""killed"" Thanos I understand that she was crying not because she loved him, like he (a fucking psychopath) suggested, but because she was relieved. The man who killed her family, kidnapped her, and did unspeakable things to her for years was now died. The though, ""she actually loves him"" never crossed my mind for even one second.

And when I watch Thanos kill her and cry I did not feel sorry for him. Leading up to that moment I thought that I understood him. that even though what he was doing was fucking terrible, that his reasons were sound, ruthless but sound. Until this scene. This was the moment when I realized that he was a delusional psychopath with no real understanding of love compassion or empathy. That moment cemented in my mind that he was undoubtedly and without question THE BAD GUY.

Yes, he wins. He's even rewarded for killing his daughter. But guess what, bad guys win ALL THE TIME. There are plenty of people out there as I'm typing this that are abusing, raping, murdering and getting away with it. That, however, has not happened in these movies yet. Every enemy is takin down some way or another by our heroes. This was SUPPOSE to be the movie where all that changed. I didn't read the comics of this event but I know a whole lot of people that did and they would say that if people didn't start dying in this movie that they were giving up all hope because everyone was supposed to die. The movie was supposed to be dark and hopeless. And the deeper into the movie you get the move hopeless and uncomfortable you are supposed to feel. When i watched this movie with my girlfriend about half way through she asked me when were the heroes gonna start turning this around and winning. I said nothing because I knew that they weren't going to win.

like I said I 100% understand you and agree with you on a lot of things, but I don't think it was a bad storytelling. This movie told A STORY about a specific group of people in a way that it was ment to be told. they didn't accidentally make Thanos a good guy, they very clearly mad him the bad guy who doesn't even know he's bad BECAUSE HE IS A PSYCHOPATH.

"While I disagree on almost all your points, I can't deny I understand why you have those views. On Star Lord's evolution, I have always viewed him as having had no reason to change his impulsiveness or childish behavior, because everytime he has been challenged in any way, he has allowed his irrational behavior to take over (prime example: Immediately trying to kill Ego with a mighty fury), and in the end, he has succeeded in that irrational goal. From a logical standpoint of psychological behavior, Quill has had no major consequential results from his actions (some might argue that Yondu's death is his fault, but I could argue back that his death is not directly caused by Peter's actions (indirectly maybe, but direct action is what drives human psychology change)). 
The stakes being ""too high"" seems strange to me... Iron Man started with Tony being tortured and manipulated by terrorists, the Winter Soldier's entire character arc is about overcoming psychological torture that has been placed and programmed in him for over 70 years. I personally don't believe that Infinity War is far too much of a step away with deep, dark topics that can be too disturbing to some. Now, does this mean I disagree with how those scenes can affect certain individuals? Not at all. I too found them quite bothersome and unsettling. But to that effect, I say the same about those previous bits that I mentioned about the other films.
I've seen a few people already explain this, so I won't delve too deep, but I don't believe the whole ""abuse = love"" bit is accurate. I've seen many people who say they ""love"" a person, but in reality, only love the power they have, the things they can get away with, etc. Abusers, more often than not, don't realize they are abusers, and to me, that was the entire point of the Thanos/Gamora relationship. Marvel wanted to bring to light the idea that abuse is not, perceptively speaking, a person doing evil and knowing they are doing evil.
On being sympathetic with Thanos... I am aware that Mikey already declared this to be an unfair argument, but you can't deny that his motivations are deliberately driven by some kind of madness. Madness is not always caused by mental illness. I have seen many people become driven by a single goal, no matter how impossible the task. And on top of that, there are an incredible amount of villains that are driven to madness by a one-minded goal that they feel they have to complete under every circumstance. On his bringing up of Empire Strikes Back, I would like to point out that the villain of that franchise became the dark lord of the Sith because he thought it was the only way to save his wife. Say what you will about the prequels, but they had that motivation laid out rather plainly. The only failure I would say about this one-note motivation is not on the part of Thanos, but on the failure of all the other characters to truly debate him. Sure, we had Gamora try and argue with him on his ship (which personally was my favorite moment in all of Thanos's motivation), but beyond that, no one truly challenged his ideology. It was purely a goal of physically stopping him. But given how committed and understood he was on his goal, I think it is clear that Thanos was supposed to be intimidating in how deranged he had become, while maintaining the persona of sanity.
If there are any points I missed that anyone would be interested in hearing my take on (unlikely I know but I need to be available in the event it happens), thensushi comment and ask.

"The justification that the Russos gave really muddies this up. Even if it was their intent to make Thanos empathetic, I hope that anyone with an ounce of real empathy recognizes that when the movie equates love and abuse it is only as a mirror to Thanos' narcissism - I say hope because I know that that isn't the case since people are constantly dealing with their own trauma, perspective, and/or privilege. The mistake that I think was made here was not only the poor choice of words by the Russos, but also the, albeit necessary, gap in time between this movie and the next which forces us to hold on to the pain and uneasiness. Because it is absolutely the case that Thanos is a very accurate depiction of the abusive guardian, and the hope is that the next movie teaches us how to defeat that particular dragon - an allusion that shouldn't need to be explained to the audience of this channel (the metaphor falls apart because the solution is going to be rounding up your best friends and curbstomping the asshole guardian but maybe it'll be cathartic, at least). It is sad, but inevitable, that toxic humans will latch onto the megalomania of toxic fictional characters, and I think when you point these people out you answer your own question about how the Black Order formed.

I loved the movie, but I don't know that it was *entertaining*. You laugh at the jokes and moments of levity because the rest of it is so oppressive. At the end of the movie the theater audiences I was present for were always dead quiet. And I think that even though the subject matter is not for children generally, this is about superheroes and superheroes always find a way to come back, from beyond death even (thanks Superman), and win - I think children, especially those in dire circumstances and abusive homes, get that.

I was lying. 

I feel as if you must’ve grown up in a home where no one hit each other. I did not. I got [bad] news for you: for too many people, abuse does equal love, and love equals abuse (fictionally, one need look no further than Gamora losing her shit after “killing” Thanos on Knowhere.)

It’s sad, but it’s true. Yeah, I get it. It’s sad. But Marvel hasn’t exactly shied away from addressing big themes, in comics AND movies.

"People are saying that the portrayal of abuse isn't justification for abuse, and many abusers claim to love the people they abuse. Mikey's point, quite simply, is not that it is bad that Thanos says he loves Gamora, nor that Gamora loves him in return. I'm sure that's realistic (though let's not get so carried away as to say realistic is always justified). But the universe agrees with Thanos. He sacrifices the person he ""loves"" to get the soul stone. What that means is, not only does HE define his relationship with Gamora as loving, but so does the MOVIE UNIVERSE. That is the problem. It is irresponsible to tell children of abusers that what is happening to them is in any way ""loving."" They hear the ""love"" justification from their abusive parents/guardians/adults. Mikey's argument is that the film has a responsibility to say that abuse is NOT actually ""loving,"" no matter how the abuser may ""feel"" about the victim. The actions of abuse are cruel. That is no definition of ""love"" we should buy or teach young people to buy or tolerate, period. That's the point.  Additionally, I see comments about how it's ok that Thanos broke the mold, shocked people, etc. This is also unresponsive to the criticism. Mikey says that structurally, the protagonist of a film is the character perspective through which the audience accesses the narrative. This means we will naturally empathize and side with the protagonist, as the story is told from his point of view. Mikey says there is something bleak and cruel about forcing audience sympathy with a genocidal monster; that really seems like observation more so than opinion. It's not about upholding Marvel to some standard of ""white knight-ness."" It's not about saying they must not innovate. Mikey simply argues that the choice--out of the box or not--to force the audience to sympathize with a person who successfully murders half the world is harsh. And seeing as we come into Marvel movies expecting something funny, human-centric, and uplifting, it's a shock in a bad way. Shock is fine. Black Panther was shocking, because the villain was sympathetic, and the hero was wrong. But this kind of cruel, ""fuck humanity,"" nihilistic trauma-baiting leaves Mikey (and many others) with some pressing questions for the future of the franchise. Mainly: are all the films going to be this bleak? Because they are going to need a reset if they want to go back to any kind of light or silly tone after this. But resetting means we experienced all this movie-trauma to no plot end or higher reason, only for spectacle. And trauma as a spectacle is a questionable strategy. It's probably true that we should handle trauma, and the trauma we ask the audience to endure, with care and respect, because enduring even voyeuristic trauma is asking a lot of people  (sometimes, it is asking them to relive their own traumas or to at least give up their imaginative escape from those traumas). It's absolutely ok to love this movie. Mikey's just pointing out that the movie traded empathy and uplifting power for spectacle and nihilism, and that's a bit of a cheap trade...because guess which one is harder to write, rarer to find, and has more pull and relevance for audiences of all kinds?",0,0,2018-08-31T16:41:30.000Z

"Hmm, interesting points, but I don't think I agree with any of them I'm afraid!

Just because Thanos is abusive and he thought he loved Gamorah doesn't mean that the movie is telling you that abuse is okay. That's the movie telling you what sort of person Thanos really is. He thinks he's a God, he acts like a cult leader, abusing his 'children' and that's what he thinks is right as long as it furthers his goals. 

Although Thanos is the mad Titan, mental health was never the focus of the movie! It comes in many different forms and with someone like Thanos, it was his ambition, lust for power and believing in his quest that really drove the story. Although how mental health is put to film is important, I personally never felt it to be distracting or anything in this one.

Although Quill has grown in the Guardian's movies, I totally understand why his character would be unstable in a way that he would be act the way he did. He'd killed his father and now he only has the Guardians as his family, when Thanos killed her, it makes sense for Quill to snap the way he did.

Plus none of the points take into account that this isn't the end of the story, many of the plot threads will be completed there and it will be much easier to judge them more completely when that happens. Perhaps Thanos regrets his decisions, maybe Quill learns to cool it, perhaps Thanos' title as The Mad Titan will be more fully explored, we just don't know at this point! It would be like judging the tone, story and character actions of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows by only Part 1, rather than both together.

Either way, still a thought out video and any new takes are always appreciated, keep being awesome Mikey!",0,0,2018-08-31T16:41:09.000Z

"I think what may be broken in this film could be corrected in the second part. This did bring a good couple points up but I believe that if they double down that abuse =/= love it could redeem that. I'm not sure exactly how they'd do it, but I'm sure it could be done. I totally get behind you though on starlord though, his character didn't feel like himself for the whole movie. That may be in part to not having James Gunn working in the character in this film, which I believe to be the case. There's a lot to love about this movie, but there are some glaring mistakes that will need to be corrected for the following films to feel like they are part of the series that we all fell in love with. The heart of this movie was creating an allegory for current times, the problem is that they ended up making it sympathetic and just expected everyone to see that Thanos was bad cause he killed your favourite heroes instead of really looking at how people are taking political discourse in this time. How the worst things are being justified for the greater good of civilization, with complete disregard for human decency.

"This is trash, sorry. It's fucking outrage culture. Abuse = love, my ass. ""If you depict bad stuff in your art - you support it"". It's just like that story with joker doing shit to a woman, and suddenly it's propaganda of rape culture, or that detroit something video game bullshit controversy. He is vilian, when you make villians do stuff, usualy you expose that stuff as bad. And it's a good thing to explore bad behavior and it's motives, to understand how it happens and why, instead of making mustache twisting bad guys, who just bad cause their some kinda ihumans. 
Because people doing horrible shit usualy justifying it. And a lot, probably most of abuse of children comes from loving parents for fucked up reasons, and they justify it for themself like ""i'm doing it out of love"". And btw victims of abuse often justify their abusers exactly the same way. Showing a crazy phychopath behaving  and thinking that way, while staying evil psychopath and while every good persons in the movie being against him is exactly what can make people reevalute this shit. 
Understand where exactly it's coming from, why exactly it's wrong and can't be tolerated, not matter what.

I get the idea that Marvel movies are for everyone, but I think the stakes this movie posed were easily justified as there has been a decade of teases and build-up, and the character of Thanos fit the bill to a T with his execution of his beliefs and actions. 

Thanos is an atrocious guy, and the torture and death are needed to really show this, but what makes him so incredible is that despite him being a brutal sociopath in areas, he is deeply complex, nuanced, and empathetic in others. You see and feel where he is coming from, and though we don't accept any of the things he's doing or has done, we still understand where he comes from and even feel for him in parts, which is what makes him so. good.

He's the bad guy Mikey. And abusive relationships are complicated for both the abuser and the victim.,0,0,2018-08-31T16:34:40.000Z
"As a victim of abuse, I think it is important for me to point out the things that this movie does right in portraying the complexity of emotions victims feel in abusive relationships. I don’t see this film as supporting or glorifying abusers, at all in fact. There is a sort of ambivalence that I feel towards my abuser, because I simultaneously hate and love them because they are a member of my family. It really isn’t as simple as “they are a bad person therefore I fully hate them” no matter what they do, which is a very sad and terrifying thing. But it is a feeling I can’t escape. I genuinely want that person to rectify their issues and become a better person, because they are not irredeemable and simplistic in nature. Often times abusers vacillate between really kind and really evil actions, which make it really hard to get away from their manipulative tendencies. I think it is really hard to have an abuser in a movie that is portrayed as fully evil because a fully evil person would be easier to escape from because there is no manipulation drawing you back in, no apologies, and no scattered loving moments. This movie actually does a pretty decent job of trying to portray the complex duality that victims feel in abusive relationships, and I appreciated their attempt at accuracy.",0,0,2018-08-31T16:34:33.000Z
"I personally don’t agree, but everyone is allowed their own opinions on films, like I personally really like bvs, but there are a lot of arguments that you use that I can’t agree with because they’re things that aren’t subjective, but please hear me out until the end. Like with the guardians, especially peter, not learning from their past films I disagree with, he’s joking because it’s been YEARS since the first 2 guardians, and he’s trying to move on from that, going back to being a little bit “jokey”, and that’s ok, but he’s obviously grown as he loves gamora and is willing to kill her on her command to save the soul stone’s location. And with the Thanos plan thing, you’re not seeing the implications it would have on our society, many people want to drastically change our lifestyles to better the environment, but there are too many people, and they prefer to stay with this same lifestyle, this provides a chance to do that, and for society to learn and grow, and hopefully not make these mistakes again, it would be the biggest historical event ever, it is not a “dumb plan”. And with Thanos “not being an empathetic villain”, I also disagree as he lost his whole planet, everyone he cared about, and believes he could of prevented it, and now he’s trying to do the same for everyone so they don’t have to go through that, but he’s gotten twisted and overtaken by his plan and has become a bit psychotic, gamora even hints at that, and her death by Thanos is not only a way to show how far he’s willing to go, but shows he believes, whether right or wrong, that this will help the whole universe. Also, with all the deaths, i mean, did you want NO STAKES in the biggest, climactic marvel movie!?

Thanos “evoking” sympathy or infamy in his willingness to go any lengths for someone he loves contrasting Wanda forced to do the same. The heroes could be more focused protecting Vision and mending bridges while the Guardians are helping Thor get to Earth (Gamora in the hot seat dealing with having to face her father).

"I already stated my point about this video over at twitter, so I am just gonna copy/paste (with a few edits) it over here.

""I usually love your videos and insight, but man, this is just. Nope. First time ever I disagree on every point you make against the movie. 
- Love isn't a pure thing, horrible people are still capable of feeling it, even in a twisted way. And abused people can still love their abusers in an equally twisted way, while still hating them. Just because you can diagnose someone's evil as a mental illness doesn't mean that it magically absolves them of whatever evil they committed. And some people are just beyond forgiveness. I bet you can diagnose just about any horrible tyrant in this world with a plethera of mental illnesses, that doesn't mean that they deserve our sympathy. Thanos is a great villain *because* he still has a human side to him. Real life villains are people, wether we like it or not. 
- And Starlord's possesivness of Gamorra is perfectly in-character, because despite him being one of ""the good guys"", he still has issues. That is the entire plot of GotG2 and why Gamora is only willing to give into her feelings for him upon learning that she will most likely die and this might be her last chance. The entire point of her not giving into his bullshit any time sooner is that she *knows* he'd be a horrible boyfriend, even if she has romantic feelings for him. And for the same reason she loves Starlord, she also feels a certain type of love still for Thanos. Cause love isn't logical and often we love people who are not deserving of it and bad for us, and Gamora is *aware* of that, which is why I think she was actually excelently written in this movie. She is a complex character with a lot of self-awareness. 
- I get that you are worried about the whole ""Thanos was right"" angle some people take, but that is meta and you always have some shitlords who'll take away bad/ the wrong message from a movie or the likes. That doesn't mean the movie is bad. 
- In regards to your ""Marvel is for everyone"" argument: Not really. Some of the movies are, yes, but then you have stuff like Iron Man 3 which is about dealing with PTSD and therefor was pretty polarising for a lot of viewers as well, cause PTSD is not a universal issue. Granted Infinity War is more polarising than any of the previous movies in the MCU, but how is that a bad thing? The whole beauty of movies is, that they let people experience things that are alien to them in a safe context. You mentioned children maybe getting traumatised, but that is actually not really a bad thing, kinda? It will emotionally prepare them for in case anything ever actually bad happens in their lives, such as losing a loved one are dealing with a truly evil person such as Thanos. And for those kids who have have already gone through such experiences, they may actually find some confort in this movie. ""Marvel is for everyone"" is a pretty weak argument to make.""

Originally forgot this point tho: You seem to be confusing empathy with sympathy here? Just because we, as the viewer, are made to understand Thanos' mindset doesn't mean the movie wants us to agree with him. It's basically a character study for a twisted madman.

Also, aside from that, the reactions to this video aparently really upset you (based on your twitter posts about it and how comments where previously disabled). I don't know how well you police comments and stuff, but what happened? Sounded like you got harassed over it?

"Mikey, fascinating opinion as always. One which I do not  totally agree with, but your points, were, as always, well thought out and articulated. 

Thanos to my mind is like a religious zealot in many ways. Everyone told him he was wrong, but it didn’t matter, because “only Thanos had the strength to do what was right” - a sacred duty as it were. To balance out the universe, even if that made no sense to an outside observer. It was Thanos’ mission, no matter how nonsensical it is. Thanos would do unspeakable things in order to achieve his objective. It was a bold move to cast Thanos as the “protagonist” in Infinity War. This was his story, much like the first Iron Man movie and Captain America: The First Avenger were to those two characters. 

“Marvel movies are made for everyone” you say and I quite agree. But with Infinity War, it was gratifying to see my investment in this universe so rewarded. I’ll put it this way, you don’t watch a season finale, without catching up with the previous episodes. 

Ah, yes on to the Guardians. In ensemble movies you often get each of the characters  - or should that be characterizations - turned up to eleven. Take the first Avenger’s film – old man Cap; snarky yet charmastic Iron Man; theatrical yet endearingly dumb Thor etc. But with Quill they regressed him to a man child, as you so succinctly put it. 

As to Gamora. She cried on Knowhere because of relief or seeing her family avenged etc. Maybe she did love Thanos in some way. Stockholm syndrome maybe. Either way, Gamora found it very traumatic, which can be attributed to several reasons. I always found Gamora to be a cold fish, but in Infinity War, I really empathised with her. Plus she’s dancing and singing when the Guardian’s are first introduced. Which shows how much the character has come. We should've known that the Guardian’s were in for a bad time. 

Interesting that you make the point about “love = abuse”. I could see that abusive relationship does not equate to love, even if it does appear that warped way to a villain like Thanos. But what of the younger audience members? What lessons are they going to take away with them? A good question.

That’s my two cents worth. Keep up the good work Mikey.

"I overall disagree,  but still a well done argument as always. But I think conflating the fact that Thanos has a broken worldview with the idea that the film endorses that worldview.  He may be the protagonist but he's still the evil villain. And the abuse story beats are not unrealistic. So many abused do love their their abusers. That love may be real or just a twisted result of the emotional manipulation. But either way breaking from that abuser is traumatic for the abused.

"The part that really had me rethink my views on this movie was the mental illness bit. I knew Thanos had a dumb plan, but dumb people with power can make the wrong decisions. Power doesn't mean smart. Look at a few specific cases of today's leaders. I knew it was a more mature movie with all of the abuse but I didn't really care because I am an adult without kids so that is never really on my mind. 

As soon as the mental illness topic came up it really got me thinking about Thanos' real motives though. The director tried to make Thanos stubborn, but also tried to show him to be intelligent. Which means my first point doesn't apply to Thanos. Using ""He's insane"" is the tool of sloppy writing and the fantasy viewpoint of insanity.

Yes, of course it was. However, originally Thanos was looking to wipe out half the universe because he wanted to impress the personification of death itself, because he had the hots for her. MCU Thanos had a noble goal, saving the universe, which he perused in a phenomenally wrong way. Comic Thanos was cartoonishly evil and selfish.

You can't expect Marvel to lie to you forever, eventually, we all have to grow up.
It's sad but it's true & it is something we ALL have to face, so, yes, Marvel movies are supposed to be made for everyone, & Infinity War is no exception.

I doubt anyone at Marvel set out to make a film where they justify abusing children, but they spent so much time trying to polish their villain, they accidentally affirmed that abusers really love their victims.

The filmmakers are in way condoning, or absolving any of the choices Thanos makes in this film, and the fact that many people have unfortunately bought into his philosophy is neither the fault of the filmmakers or the film itself. To put it simply.... Thanos is Donald Trump, he's a toxic, abusive, fear mongering bully who tricks people into following him through conviction and charisma.

He is an abusive being and like many abusers, he cannot see that, at all. I feel however that a lot of criticisms of Infinity War are not taking into account that this is only half of the story. As a story this is showing everything going right for Thanos, he gives up everything he has and fights off all the wrong people and makes everything perfect. Which cannot be true, none of it if this story is going to be a good well story. Everything Thanos did for ""the right reasons"" he will have to live with and atone for. It's the only way for this film to have any meaning, for it not to be a glorification of abuse and torture and murder.  The next movie has to firmly show Thanos suffering for his actions by his own hand, show him that even with all the power in the universe, in reality, in time, he cannot be satisfied with what he has done, he cannot put out the fire he lit.

(Nevermind if any of the filmmakers have used the word 'sympathetic' at some point, irrelevant) Full stop, Thanos is not a sympathetic villain. You're not meant to feel bad for his pain in any way. Hes the protagonist because you're meant to *em* pathize with him - to put yourself in his shoes and follow his train of thought, to understand how he reaches the conclusions he does. You don't have to like someone to empathize with them. In fact, it's *really important* to empathize with people you hate or find contemptible!

Everyone does the things they do for a reason. Understanding why people do horrible things is *so* important for preventing others from making those mistakes and rehabilitating those who already have. Thanos is probably irredeemable, but making him a bullheaded strongman that's uncomfortably close to real life is the point - the world needs now more than ever understanding of why and how people do terrible things, or else we'll never fix them. You don't have to condone or tolerate to understand. Always fight evil wherever you find it, but a refusal to empathize only consigns evil deeds to being inscrutable shadows that can never be solved, rather than the result of circumstances or upbringing that can be prevented, tantamount to giving up.",280,12,2018-08-31T15:45:47.000Z

So, does art at that size have a responsibility to be for everyone? Does it have a duty to the people more than to be entertaining or smart?

"Honestly Mikey, I think the most incorrect thing about this video comes at the very beginning when you state ""This piece will be divisive and I don't intend it to be, but this movie is unapologetically divisive.""

The movie was met with acclaim both from fans and critics alike and in no way can be considered divisive. It's the same way (for example) that the Justice League was panned. To say that movie is divisive (as many have tried to claim) would again be incorrect as most people disliked it.

What I think has happened here is that in your quest to find favour with your opinion on a truly divisive movie (The Last Jedi), you have projected all the counter-arguments against that film onto this one. 

Consciously or subconsciously you have intended for this video to be divisive. This is the sequel to your defence of The Last Jedi.",62,2,2018-08-31T15:39:10.000Z

Comic Thanos does what he does because he sees (and up until recently, it could be debated it was all in his head) Death and does everything to woo her. The effort made to omit that just makes him kind of... a white supremacist.

I knew marvel did something right when I followed a couple children out of the theater and the were sobbing and telling their parents they didnt like the ending. The shock value worked. Obviously the Avengers have to win in the end so the shock should be temporary for most viewers. Really the long term impact of this film relies on the strength of the next one.

I left the cinema thinking that Thanos is a cruel, destructive character that doesn’t see anything wrong with his motivation and will do anything to see it through. That includes torture, personal sacrifice and mass killing. He can’t see another way and that is what is really wrong with him. 
 With the Guardians, I always felt they were a bit off. I know their stupid antics and the stuff they say is supposed to be funny but it feels out of place. Swearing all the time and being dicks too each other is just annoying.

"Mikey, my guy. I love this channel and will continue to love it. However, I disagree with you on this one and I want to argue my viewpoint.

I get where you're coming from. I can only imagine what you went through last year and your reaction is valid. I do, however, disagree with your arguments on Infinity War on a movie-level. Specially regarding abuse and Thanos. I don't think the movie portrays abuse = love at all. Gamora herself doesn't believe Thanos loves her. What the movie argues, though, is that Thanos is an horrible being and in his horrible mind the feeling that comes from the act of taking Gamora under his wing and seeing her grow to become this fierce assassin is love.

It is not. It may be a screwed-up version of pride, but not love. Love wouldn't let a man kill his own daughter like that. But in Thanos mind, he loves her. I understand that you argue that if Thanos is the protagonist, the story validates what he does. But if that was the case, every time a hero-like protag did something wrong (see: Tony Stark in the second Iron Man) and the people around him tell him IS wrong, we'd still have to say that the movie portray's the hero's reckless actions as right. And we know movies don't do that. There are character arcs and journeys and points A and points B. People change.

That's the same with Thanos. Much like heroes who do the wrong things before learning to change and becoming better, Thanos does wrong things because he believes he is right while even his own daughter tells him he is wrong.

The difference is Thanos is a villain and as a villain, his actions are worse. And when the movie actually shows him NOT changing and following through with the plan (the logic of which is really dumb, but hey, suspension of disbelief) it is numbing. We leave the theather feeling like crap. That is not validation of Thanos' actions. That is, however, an honest portrayal of a bad person, and we can't hide from that. We can't even hide children from that. There are bad people and they do bad things and we all should see that the consequences of these actions hurt. That's why they're bad in the first place.

Showing this is valid, but showing this does not validate this behavior. It would if by the end Steve Rogers turned and was like ""you know what, he is right!"". No one does that. Thanos is evil, and that shouldn't be hidden. That needs to be shown and fought because if it's not, we get the end of this movie: sadness. The world is full of evil. Hiding it is not the way to go, validating it isn't either. I don't think this movie does any of that. 

But again, that's me. I cannot help but interpret this movie as myself and you can't do it any other way either, that's why places like this and channels like this are great. We can all talk and be respectful (which I hope is the case with anyone who responds to this comment).",0,0,2018-08-31T15:10:29.000Z
"I think you are wrong in such an important way, you neglect to realise the truth behind the story of Thanos, to this character, this scenario of starvation and over population happened - So to Thanos this is the truth that he sees and this alone easily explains why he does what he does. To go deeper you can explain how he suffers a mental trauma from his past and its not unlikely that a man who lost everything would come to love another child who is not his own. Stockholm syndrome for Gamora  is a very common and known mental illness, you just wave past all of this. 

Thanos is a strong character because what we see are all his floors and depression and anxiety. He can't fail because if he does he feels the universe will fall apart, that is why he is okay to kill his daughter. IT IS NOT AN ACCEPTANCE FROM THE WRITERS, the writers never said killing your children was an okay thing to do. But to give Thanos believable story that he is willing to do anything, he had to do it.

He was killing the thing he loves most in his life, so that he may succeed in the higher ideal of his mission. It more like, duty=life-love. His duty outweighs everything, including the thing he loves most. At the end, gamora asks him, ""what did it cost?"" He answers, ""everything."" Also, thanos is not a depiction of mental illness.

I felt like they really wanted to make us uncomfortable by making a guy who, on the surface, could pass as rational and sympathetic, but is honestly someone who isn't actually doing anything worth dedending. 

He's pushing his agenda for his own goals, and is a worse person for it. I hadn't seen those interviews that you brought up, but honestly, I think there should have been a stronger rebuttal to this philosophy because it is wrong. I hope they do rebut it unequivocally in the next film, but I digress.

"*Bit of a long reply, but I feel as though its very important. 

I felt that having Thanos as the perspective focus of the film works well to both show his complexities and discredit his ideology. Thanos is complex/""sympathetic"" in the sense that he knows his actions are horrific, but thinks that by culling the universe he'll ultimately be saving it. His desire to save the universe is nobel, but his method is COMPLETELY wrong,horrific, barbarous and evil. The MANY moral and practical flaws in his plan/goal are shown and lambasted several times in the movie. Like when he tortures Thor and Nebula in front of there siblings for the Space Stone and Soul stone respectively, strangles Loki to death while forcing Thor to watch, and also when Gamora, Dr. Strange and Nebula (separately) talked about how Thanos doesn't know that the universe is destined  to run out of resources like it did on Titan. Thanos is sympethetic in the sense that his fear of the universe's limitations are plausable, while primarily unfounded. If in the far future it came to fruition that Thanos's warning was true, the people of the universe may look back and think ""He was right. He was trying to save us "". BUT, the major flaw in this, besides all the murder kidnapping and tourture, is that he is doing all of this based on a hunch. After all, would a savior of the universe and its people take such glee in wholesale slaughter and tourture? That's why they didn't use the trailer line ""Fun isn't something one considers when balancing the universe. But, this does put a smile on my face."" It makes the point the movie was trying to make too obvious.

On the subject of Thanos and Gamora's relationship, I thought they handled it very well. Thanos shed tears when he killed her, because he came to truly and deeply love and care for her. Yeah, he's a massmurdering sociopath/psychopath, but he still has feelings, evident in the aforementioned scene and in the Soul World scene. Now, Gamora crying when she thought she killed Thanos was a masterpiece to me. First and foremost, Gamora's and Thanos's relationship is ENTIRELY abusive and toxic. But, her crying at his apparent death, illustrates the deeper impacts of those types of relationships. In GotG 1, Gamora made it very clear she hates Thanos and sought to escape his grasp/control. Make no mistake, she has very clearly identified the toxicity and wants to escape it. But, Thanos's brand of abuse and manipulation would have irreversible affected her. After all, he apparently raised her with enough ""love and caring"" along side the horrific abuse to garner her loyalty for a time. Like Harley Quinn and Joker, he gave her just enough love to make her think he cares, whilst also treating her terribly. Although it seems Thanos did truly love her,  but his love was incredibly toxic. Gamora's tears at his apparent death show how when someone is abused and manipulated for so long, the abuser takes a bit of them away forever. Thanos's twisted love slithered its way into her heart long ago and took hold. Now, some where deep in her heart she loves him, alla Harley Quin and Joker. And she KNOWS she shouldn't, but she can't undo the manipulation he did. She's likely furious at herself for feeling for him dispite knowing he was a horrible person. It would have been entirely disingenuous for Gamora to not cry at his death. Because abuse doesn't end when you escape your abuser. The scars it leaves on you emotionally and or physically never go away.  

Now, Starlord's reaction to learning of Gamora's death was infuriating as an audience member, but totally understandable. Over the course of the two GotG films, Gamora was the driving force behind Quill's growth and maturation. He'd lost his mother, adoptive father and biological father rather recently. The main thing holding him together would have been Gamora. She was strong willed, kind and despite Quill describing himself as her ""extended booty call"" he very obviously loves her. He tries to dismiss his deep feelings by underplaying how he views their relationship. But, without Gamora, he's emotionally broken and incomplete. She was the glue that held him together, and when Quill realized she wasn't coming back...he fell apart...

And lastly, I felt as though the emotional deaths of the Avengers weren't for cheap thrills and feels. I felt like they were used to give a greater characterization to the victims and there companions while simultaneously discrediting Thanos's goal further. Does a 15 year old crying and begging in fear and confusion look like ""Saving the Universe"" to you? As the audience, we often overlook the human side of these characters. But, under all the action, colors and music are supposed to be people, with real emotions and fear. The looks of confusion, horror and utter despair on the faces of the survivors and Spider-Man works INCREDIBLY well to convey there humanity. Our heroes were at there most vulnerable and weak ever in the MCU. Spider-Man's death in particular was so heart wrenching because it illustrates his and the heroes humanity and fears. At the end of the day, there just people. They feel, they hurt and they fear just as easily as us. Although we, as the audience, know these deaths won't stick, the in-universe characters don't know that. We saw them at there lowest, and it was so impactful/upsetting because we saw them as Human for the first time.",144,13,2018-08-31T14:48:02.000Z
"One interesting thing I think is worth unpacking a bit is the idea that 'winning' means 'being right' or 'being justified'.  This is where I think a lot of the issues with Thanos and people saying he has a point or he is right come up, and I think also forms the core of why people need to actually try and refute his argument in some mechanical 'this won't actually be effective' manner.  But sometimes I feel there is the expectation in modern society that success == justification, morality, or divine providence.  That if someone succeeds, it is because they were meant to succeed and have a certain degree of...  something.  Divine providence?  The blessings of fate?

It's never luck, or things happening to fall together properly.

I've always felt that Thanos' plan is extremely easily refuted - Cap puts it best.  We don't kill one person for the good of the many, and we certainly don't kill every other person for good of the remainder.  But there's also another important message there, and one I do hope is born out by the other half of this movie:  a hero tries to save everyone, and doesn't settle for sacrifice in the name of expedience.  By trying to show that the mechanics of Thanos' plan are unworkable, I feel that people give far too much credence to the *morality* of his plan.

'This won't work if you only delete half!  Thanos doesn't go far enough, we need to wipe out like 90 percent of all life!'

Screw that noise.  The snap is *never* justified in a universe where we care about love, hope, and people's right to life.  I feel like this point gets ignored far too often in favor of arguing the mechanics - and by doing so, we accede to the villain a greater moral standing based on the fact that he was successful in his mission.",0,0,2018-08-31T14:47:52.000Z
"I'm gonna have to respectfully disagree with you a little bit. You're math about his plan not working is OK, but it doesn't take birth rate, or development into consideration. Our population isn't rising exponentially forever, it's smoothing out and birth rates are falling as tech goes up and child death down. When you take this into account Thanos plan could work, but it would have to be more evil. By wiping out half of the population where there birth rate is low because of high tech development and the likes, it wouldn't be a reset, but actually do what Thanos want. But he would have to only do it to worlds that are evolved/developed enough and he would have to not pick who dies at random, because his random idea is actually the real reason he's plan doesnt work. As we see in the movie, when a random half of the population disappears, chaos ensues. I.e plane crashes and other accidents. And what if all the knowledge to move forward was lost in the half that disappeared? (potential for heavy loss of infrastructure and knowledge)
So his plan could only work in theory and couldn't be implemented the way he does it. So the plan is stupid (we haven't Even talked about the world's where he already wiped out half or how exactly half works; half of everything, but divided into world's or everyone in one pool?).
With the evil part, I get what you're saying, but my counter would be, that this movie isn't for everyone, but for people who have already seen all the other movies, and watching all those movies takes years and you grow up and mature with the films, and hopefully you understand how evil Thanos is, even though he has a twisted version of love. What I mean by that is, young kids shouldn't watch the movie. 
I personally thought they did a good job at doing exactly what you described; raising the stakes. There was a lot of torture and evil from the Hands of Thanos and his disciples (or cultist) and to me it really showed, that even though some of the other villains we have seen were evil, they don't come close to Thanos. Because Thanos evil is of a fanatical, almost religious, belief, one that he feels he's proven through the tragedy of his own world and the flourishing of gamora's after his solution.
So I guess it's like you said in the beginning, it's a divisive movie. I actually haven't heard this take before and I feel for you, but maybe if the movie affected you so much, it shows how well made the movie was (wether or not you like the intentions of the directors and studio etc.).",0,0,2018-08-31T14:47:42.000Z

Of course some of your other nitpicks such as the abuse = love and whatnot are fair (although i believe the Quill scene was fine), and i respect your opinion and that you may have had issues with the film.
Also speaking of the abuse = love, it wasn't quite the case (from my interpretation). Gamora was constantly lashing out and trying to kill Thanos, but that didn't stop her from feeling connected and emotionally tied to him regardless. It is a genuine psychological concept and scenario for someone feel for someone abusive regardless because of the relationshop they have built, and even defend the abuser against their better judgment. Gamora was still emotionally connected to Thanos, and Thanos believed himself to be doing the right thing in has misguided view leading to the tearful thanos receiving the soul stone. It was a lot more simple than you made it out to be, they had a relationship, toxic but nevertheless a strong one.
Characters like captain america and captain marvel are going to be the big redeemers tackling thanos in the next film from what i hear, remember that thanos only temporarily won and the story hasn't ended, you kind of mentioned this with the ""darkest before dawn"" point but i still feel it was relevant to point out and remember.
Yes, they did swing around their stakes and power to influence misery, but i don't see how its that genuinely sickening aside from maybe the Gamora/Thanos complication.

"I respect your opinion, but I disagree on almost every point you've made in this video. So as not to nitpick every line of the script though I'm going to just keep to what I veiw as the main points.

Infinity War's scenes are too dark and uncomfortable to watch: In a movie where the protagonist is the villain and the villain wins. By all accounts this is not a good thing and the movie does not treat it as a good thing.It is dark because Thanos winning is an incredibly dark scenario. If you hae a problem with that, I'm sorry but I don't think this movie was ever going to be for you.

Infinity War glorifies Thanos being abusive to Gamora: No. It does the exact opposite by treating it as a terrible tragedy that Thanos is so warped and twisted that he does genuinely believe his treatment of gamora constitutes love, and that he believes he is sacrificing that love for the soul stone. We, being rational people understand that what he is doing is wrong and terrible, and Gamora tells him point blank that this isn't love. But the test of the Soul Stone doesn't differentiate between the two because as far as Thanos is concerned, regardless of how he's treated her it's all been for her own good.

Starlord ruining everything when he finds out thanos killed gamora is example of Starlord not learning from any past mistakes and growing as a character: You tied this in to James Gunn's firing and I do not understand why as I believe a movie should stand or fall regardless of what goes on behind the scenes of it's creation. I have not been following the behind the scenes drama here as it doesn't particularly interest me. There was no narrative throughline in the past two GotG movies of Quill needing to learn how to control his temper. I don't know where you got that impression. If there was any sort of narrative throughline in the GotG series it's how they are all growing as a part of this dysfunctional family and the overcoming the challenges that come with it.
I would further charge that this was entirely keeping with Quill's character to go ballistic after learning what's happened to Gamora, because what he has with her does constitute actual love. You showed a clip of the scene where Quill shoots Ego multiple times after learning that Ego was the one who game his mother cancer. I view that as one of the best scenes in that movie because it was once again a perfectly realistic response. The scene where Quill learns that Gamora is dead and attacks Thanos is a perfect mirror to that scene, the difference being that it was the exact wrong thing to do. And once more, it is not treated as the right thing to do.

We are undercutting the struggles of actual people suffering from mental illness by defending the movie with the idea that Thanos is insane: No, I don't believe we are. You are conflating real world issues with escapist fantasy where a big robot piloted by a man who can turn into a green rage monster fights alongside a talking raccoon and his kid tree and a king who drank super plant juice to become strong against a purple man who wants to kill half of everyone. Yes, mental health is a serious issue. It is also not something that a writer, be it of movies or comic books should have to consider every time they want to write a story where the villain is doing something that rational people would consider insane.

It is wrong that Thanos is being hailed as a hero: I'm going to assume for a moment that people making this claim aren't just shitposting in the vein of ""Hitler did nothing wrong."" as my only reply to that is that jokes don't have to be serious. What I'm understanding of your argument here is that people are making the mistake of using Hero and Protagonist interchangeably with regard to Thanos, which is correct. Thanos is not the hero, he's the protagonist. The movies do not treat what he is doing or has done as a good thing that is to be encouraged, if anything the movies are doing all they can to try to prevent what he is trying to accomplish and failing.

Where do we go from here?This is part 1 of a two part movie, the culmination of everything these marvel movies have been leading up to. Yes, it feels like a season finale and a cliffhanger because it is. Yes, we know it's going to be reversed because of course it is. The heroes are going to win and the day will be saved. That's how stories work. There can be no triumph without hardship, and I expect there will be great triumph come infinity war 2.
You can absolutely go low stakes after high stakes because we saw that in Spiderman Homecoming. His stakes were not world ending or global by most stretches of the imagination, he just wanted to stop the flow of alien weapons on the streets. Its street level crime.

"Yeah a lot of the points made here simply don't make a lot of sense. And I'm not just taking a dig because you're dissing Infintiy War, I legitimately don't understand where you're coming from with a lot of what you're saying.

First the Gamora and Thanos Abuse thing. This point only makes sense if you think the Movie is portraying Thanos as the Good Guy. It's very clearly not. He's the one going around murdering people for crying out loud. I mean think about what your own interpretation means when you make a logical continuation. ""Oh no kids that are abused might think that it's all okay because their abuser really loves them"" and then they keep watching for literally another 30 seconds ""Oh fuck my abuser might actually kill me this is bad"" and then they watch the rest of the movie ""My Abuser might take away everyone I love and is a generally horrible person this is not good!"" like you seem to be cherrypicking here in order to create your own narrative as to why you don't like something. As a few others have said it seems a lot more like your own personal hang-ups are coloring your perception of events. Like when you called this ""Irresponsible filmmaking"" it felt like the equivalent of calling Die Hard or John Wick irresponsible filmmaking because a Warvet had his PTSD triggered watching it after hearing gunfire. 

But yeah the biggest thing is that you seem to have somehow interpreted the movie as saying that because we focus on thanos and are set to learn why he does the things he does, that that's supposed to mean that he's the good guy. But nobody actually thinks that everything he's doing is right. At least nobody that's sane. Like even if we accept that Thanos's plan would 100% work, that doesn't make it any more ethical of a plan. And the movie doesn't need more than one scene of Gamora telling Thanos he's wrong because you have to be an idiot to think that killing half of everyone is the best possible solution, even if you believe it'd work, and it seemed like the videos you put on screen to try to demonstrate your point of people siding with thanos, were mostly talking about what would happen if he killed everyone not saying that we should just start doing all those murders. 

Understanding his motivations and why he's taking the actions he's taking is what I call good villain writing. Good antagonists don't see themselves as the antagonists. Everyone is the Hero of their own story because you don't just do evil things for the sake of being Evil. That's why the Vulture in Spiderman Homecoming was so good, because you could actually empathize and understand why he ended up doing the things he was doing and how he got to the point of being a typical comic book villain. But nobody is saying that what the Vulture is doing was right, we just were able to understand how he got there. At no point is the Movie trying to say that what Thanos is doing is right nor does it portray him in a good light. All that happened is we got to see much more of the typical comic book villain than we used to, and we understand how Thanos believes himself to be the Hero, not necessarily that he is the hero. 

Also as a side note with the population culling thing. It is a tad more complicated than you make it out to be. You seem to be under the impression that Population grows at a static rate and that if we went back to 3.5 Billion or 72 mil that it would take exactly the same amount of time to grow back to the current size. However population grows at different rates for all sorts of other factors. The main reason we've seen such a huge population boom in the last few hundred years is the advancement of Medicine, and then a change in culture. 

Medicine and general sanitation was so shitty that People used to have tons of kids because hardly any of them would make it to adulthood. And due to all that even the ones that made it to adulthood might not live super long. But then as science and medicine developed, more people were able to make it to adulthood and live longer lives, but people were still having tons of babies. That's why the population suddenly exploded so much. Overtime culture shifts to match and people start having fewer and fewer kids, but this is a shift that by its nature takes several generations to make. But already we're seeing a dramatic decrease in the number of people being born and the population will continue to grow more slowly until it stops entirely when people on average are having only 2 kids or less. So theoretically if you cut the population in half, we wouldn't just suddenly start skyrocketing in population again like we did in the 70's. The Global Growth rate has decreased since then and will continue to do so, and we wouldn't suddenly go back to the culture of having 5 kids on average per family anymore when we're currently around 2.5. For a better and more detailed explanation of this phenomenon, I recommend that channel with the name that's super hard to pronounce: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348 . This honestly wasn't as much about trying to prove Thanos right but more to clear up the oversimplification you made the issue out to be. I mean if you watch that video they show that Population growth will eventually solve itself which that alone kinda breaks Thanos's plan. 

But again, none of this matters. I could sit here convincing you for hours that Thanos's plan would or wouldn't work, but it doesn't matter how good or bad the plan is because there has to be a better way. Yeah the Pyramids are pretty cool to look at, but they probably aren't worth the thousands of slaves it took to make them. At no point is the film like ""Yeah thanos's plan is a great plan and we should all get behind it"" I mean all of our favorite superheroes are currently doing literally everything in their power to stop said plan from happening. All that matters is that the plan makes sense to him well enough, in order to help justify his own Actions. There are countless Villains in real life, hell that are currently elected president, who have downright stupid plans. But they believe that their plan will somehow work. And as long as it's believable that he could believe his own plan, then 

So lets talk about Starlord. At first I had a similar reaction to Starlord thinking that it was a massive character assassination, and I'm honestly shocked that you went with that same gut-reaction that so many other people had coming out of this movie. But everyone seems to have forgotten what those previous GotG movies are about. Primarily I'd say that both movies lay heavily on the themes of Family and Love, not just physically related family but also those you form close bonds with. Yes Peter matured a little bit over the movies but have you seen how both of those movies end? In the first one he literally starts singing and dances at the bad guy. And in the second one they establish that if you reveal that you've harmed a loved one, that he will not hesitate at all to attack you. Gee that sounds familiar. 

Peter is hardly the mature adult that you seem to make him out to be, he's still a goofball and whatnot by the end of those movies, so him being jealous of Thor and whatnot all makes sense to me. I mean from what I understand James Gunn himself helped direct those scenes. His increased maturity in those movies comes more from having a better understanding of the people around him and caring more to not want to piss them off. He's still impulsive at times. He's still a goof. He still loves outdated technology and great old songs that remind him of his Mom. His personality is more or less the same as it always was, he just is willing to stop acting out around people he cares about. That's why he acts nicer around Gamora and Drax, but then when he starts interacting with people he's never heard of before like Tony, he starts acting like a dick again.

And I mean talk about trauma. Starlord was just forced to make possibly the hardest decision in his life, hell one of the hardest decisions that anyone could possibly be forced to do: being forced to kill his own loved one for the greater good, and then he had that decision ripped away from him at the last second by Thanos. If there is one character whos thoughts might be a little cloudy at that point in time, it would be his. And sure he was back to being happy-go-lucky on Titan, but think about it. From his perspective Gamora might still be alive, she's only been kidnapped. There's still a chance that if he kills Thanos here and now that they win and he gets back Gamora. But then Thanos reveals that no. He killed Gamora. That extremely hard decision that he was forced to make only a few hours prior, not only was taken away from him at the last second, but Gamora died anyways and Thanos got exactly what he wanted.  Literally the worst possible scenario for him suddenly came crashing down onto his shoulders all at once. I'm pretty sure you could put any character in the MCU in Starlord's shoes at that moment and they'd act exactly the same way. And the fact that Peter cared that much about Gamora as if she were family, fits in line with the primary themes of GotG, especially the end of GotG 2 where they heavily reinforce that Family isn't just blood.",0,0,2018-08-31T14:35:52.000Z

"Soooo... Some things I'll agree on all day.

The guardians lost a lot of their nuance and I felt it big time. Drax was back to being fairly flat revenge man. Peter Was full man child instead of the growing up manchild. Mantis was there for comedy and her power. Groot defaulted to a mean spirited little teen who still gave a shit to fight at the end for some reason not known. The only characters given their dues really were Gamora (Who was miserable) and Rocket.

On the subject of her death, yes we are supposed to take away from this he loves her and yes her killing him does trigger an emotional response. Yes that IS very fucked up. It's supposed to be fucked up. Thanos isn't crazy, he's locked in his own reality and wont hear a counter point as valid (That's far more relevant to modern life than insanity.) Gamora is the victim of constant gas lighting and abuse. Yes, reality check you can want these people dead, hate them with every fiber of your being, and still have an emotional breakdown when it happens If nothing else for the release of pain. These 2 people, as much as they are willing or eager to kill each other for what they believe still FEEL SOMETHING about it. Was this the correct decision? That's up for argument. I know more than my fair share of folk who were abused and thankfully they connected with Gamora and understood, instead of feeling helplessly at Thanos' side. I certainly do pity the folk who experienced the latter.

This movie was quite dark from the word go. I'm sorry if that felt too real for you. It is not a pleasant time to be a empathetic human right now.",2,2,2018-08-31T14:28:47.000Z

He's not shown to be doing the right thing. Of course he justifies is in lots of ways... But every villain of an arc of storytelling does this.

"I agree with the tonal and messaging issues of the “Abuse = Love” critique. Sometimes it is difficult to understand the deeper intents of writers, because although it seems like it is all on the screen, they don’t just come out and say what they were going for. Considering that this is part one of a two-part story, I can’t help but feel like the point of having Thanos as the protagonist was to give the audience the opportunity to explore in a meaningful way a villain that not only has an ill-conceived plan, but to also see all of the awful ideas and character traits that constitute the villain. We know it is illogical from the omnipotent view of the audience, but I think the point is that within his own head it makes sense to him - and we are supposed to sympathize with him while we hate him. Maybe that is giving the writers too much credit.",0,0,2018-08-31T14:10:28.000Z

It's just a hard word to define that is defined differently between people, cultures, species, etc. So saying Thanos doesn't love someone like Gamora is a bit of a singular view on it.

"When it comes to comic book movies I have a policy of taking what's given to me and going from there. When I think about the plot of the movie 90% of the time I don't ask what the writers were thinking because I'm not watching the writers, I'm watchig the movie. So when I listened to Thanos explain himself I didn't ask, ""why would the writers write Thanos that way,"" instead I said to myself, ""oh that's an alien being from a different part of the galaxy who's views of the universe are clearly twisted and corrupt because of countless years of being more powerful than everyone else he's ever met since the destruction of his home planet leaving him with trauma and his corrupted mind has resorted to this philosophy so he can cope with the things that have happened to him."" No I don't agree with him nor do I think his look on life is particularly logical, but that's because he is dealing with one form or another of PTSD. And I don't think it's fair to say the stakes of this movie were unjustified, a powerful person (Titan) with already a lot of power got his hands on some pretty powerful shit and did what he wanted. It's justified to the person (Titan) with the power, even if it isn't to us the audience. I can't speak for anyone else, but that's how I saw it.",0,0,2018-08-31T14:03:04.000Z

"One of the director's Tweet said that half of all life in the universe includes animals and plants. That means Thanos screwed over every overly industrialized planet in the universe. Take Earth for example, if half of all human died, the planet would be healthier. Half of all plants die means half of all Carbon Dioxide sucking oxygen making factory dies. It will royally screw over Earth's environment and oxygen production. Even with 3.5 billion people left on Earth, they'll still need electricity and factories to build stuff, CO2 will still get pumped into the atmosphere. 
With a crisis like this, the starving people overly populated planets still won't get fed. Half of the living food supplies, crops and farm animals, also just turned into ash. 
Thanos may just 'increase' raw resources like minerals two fold by killing half of all life in the universe. Plants and fungus probably will do fine, but anything that's needs to eat plants and animals will be screwed!

"Love isn't one thing, one standard. ""Bad people"" also love and do bad things to people they love, because of that love. Abusers do love (as in they can, not that it's a rule) people they abuse. Abused people do love their abusers (and sometimes that's why they stay with them). Love is very subjective and it's a two-way street - you give your interpretation of love to someone else and you get their interpretation. It's rarely that same exact thing - with Thanos (and abusers) that difference is taken to the extreme.

I didn't like a lot about this movie but this part I think they made really well. Where Thanos and his relationship with other characters aren't one-dimensional. At some points, you can 100% understand his point of view and it might make you scared afterward. But that's ok because he's a complex character with heavy moral problems. Everyone would like rainbows and unicorns but when it comes to certain problems and certain decisions the lines become blurry and there's never one clear right and one clear wrong. The history will decide, written by the winners, in hindsight. Was dropping the bomb, or any for that matter is a good thing? You kill people but you might end the war. The point is that you might disagree but some things aren't clearly bad or clearly good. You snap your fingers and half of the population dies, giving whatever time to the rest. You could also snap your fingers and double the resources. Each of this decisions has consequences - none of them are the good or the bad one. Not if you're willing to live in the grey areas and not just follow the simplistic views or right and wrong, of villains who should be defeated by the good guys in the end.

You can argue that the movie made Thanos too likable, too relatable for a comic movie. That they didn't emphasize enough that the abuse towards his ""daughters"" is a terrible thing, but what you essentially say here is that Thanos should be just a generic villain that no one loves, that strangles a random woman because she asked a question (Killmonger) - just to emphasize that he's the bad guy. No - this time the villain is a bit more complex - he loves and is loved in his own way, like many people in similar relationships. He has a more complex goal that the girl or the money. You can hate him, you can disagree with everything he does but with Thanos it's just not going to be that simple as saying that his just a bad guy.",0,0,2018-08-31T13:52:52.000Z

"Disagree about Quill, agree about Thanos. Quill’s arc made sense to me and I don’t think he regressed, he was just thrown into a unwinnable situation. I feel sorry for him and Gamora. 

I have 0 empathy for the abusive grape and the writers/directors failed to convince me Thanos is sympathetic. I feel like they kept jerking it to an abuser throughout the movie, as many people do while ignoring, blaming, mocking the victim (Gamora.) This happens a lot in real life and the dude writers handled that so terribly. It is not nuanced to me because they failed to manipulate me into feeling bad for an abusive murderer. They rewarded him for killing the woman he kidnapped twice and canonically tortured. 

“He tortured me.” Gamora said this in GotG, but fans ignore her, blame her, mock her death  bc the Russos framed it so badly. They nerfed Gamora and dumbed her down to make her abuser look good and competent and that whole part of the movie infuriates me. As an abuse survivor it is horrible, telling me that abusers are right and their toxic love is what really matters. Survivors like me will just get killed anyway for being dumb and irrational. Gamora getting 2 seconds of falling while her abuser gets 5 minutes dedicated to his crocodile murder tears is really disgusting to me. The writers like him way too much and this is why millions of people stan an abuser. They should not stan abusive toxic relationships but many people don’t care about abuse survivors and worship abusers in fiction and real life. 

The fact that Tony, Thor, and Quill get Badass arcs and survive their daddy issues but Gamora gets kidnapped, dumbed down, barely gets 2 seconds to fight and discarded like trash, furthers shows how bad her ‘arc’ is in IW. 

The movie does some things right like Quill pulling the trigger (which Pratt and Gunn changed in the script) and I liked seeing Quill and Gamora together, but other things like Thanos and Gamora’s stuff left a bad taste in my mouth. I don’t think his relationship with Gamora was portrayed well at all. It was too one sided to make him look good and Gamora stupid and weak which is why people like that she died and praise an abuser.

Ego was handled the correct way. We could hate Thanos but way too many people think he’s right and what with all these shootings and women being kidnapped and killed, Thanos being idolized among fans is very uncomfortable to me. There is a sickness in our culture in which abusers are seen as correct and strong and the dude writers/directors (I’m including Gunn in there) just went along with it bc they don’t understand what it’s like to be a female abuse victim. They think we are trash while cool guys like Tony Thor and Steve get all the glory. It was sad to get confirmation of this “abuse is good! Yeah killing and torturing women is cool, kids!” With the triumphant music playing over Gamora’s fridging in a weak attempt to parallel Yondu trading his life for Peter’s in vol 2,

I’m certain Gamora and Nebula won’t kill Thanos (they are the most deserving ones but Russos don’t really care about them other than using them to make Thanos look powerful and heroic). the Gamora-Thanos only felt like a flimsy way to tell us to like the villain. Which I don’t, never will, and I am not excited about more “let’s glorify and praise an abusive murderer!!!” circle jerk in A4.",8,24,2018-08-31T13:51:18.000Z

Honestly, I loved this movie. But it's terrifying that people think Thanos actually loved Gamora. That's not what love is. No loving parent would chuck their kid down a cliff. Thanos had to sacrifice Gamora not because he loved her, but because he thought he owned her. Like when you're a kid and your parents say that if you want a new toy, you have to donate an old one. Gamora is the old toy, she's the means to an end, a tool. Maybe Thanos even thinks that he loved Gamora, but he *didn't*. She was his plaything, and it hurt his pride when she escaped. He sacrificed her because she was as valuable to him as the stone, but that doesn't mean he loved her.",0,0,2018-08-31T13:50:55.000Z

You have a really naive outlook on love and abuse here amigo. The hardest part about parental abuse is dealing with the fact that they DO love you but that the best thing for you to do, as their child, is to hurt them because you don't deserve the abuse.  That just because someone you love loves you doesn't mean that you should keep them in your life. That's fucking hard. 

The justification Thanos uses isn't strange at all. It's been used many many many times.



I do agree that it was painfully obvious that they're just going to undo it. I don't understand at all why people liked the ending. Or were moved by it. It didn't affect me in the least because it was obvious none of them actually died.

What's funny to me is how much of your criticism here makes way more sense in criticism of The Last Jedi. Which is strange that you liked.

"I honestly think we need to wait for the conclusion. I don't think the movie was that calous in equating love with abuse, I believe it made the point that Thanos himself believes that, but we shouldn't, simply because he's wrong. Not even necessarily mad, just very wrong. 
Comparing it to Star Wars, by the end, in Jedi, Vader says to Luke ""You were right about me"". Vader, whom we start to empathize for a moment in Empire because he tries to reach out to his son, ends up understanding he was completely wrong about his entire life as Vader, and that power alone won't help him solve everything he finds needs correction. And maybe there really wasn't anything needing correction in the first place.

(and let me apologise in advance for bringing Hitler to an internet comment section) just like Hitler and his pals believed their actions had a point, which was to make the world a better place from their pov, they were infinitely wrong, for so many reasons, and not only reasons related to justice and morality but also from a scientific perspective. And so is Thanos. His logic is completely failed: it _is_ immoral, no matter if the erasing is random or not, and the universe isn't a static system, so this ""solution"" isn't permanent and thus it's a scientific failure.
 
I've experienced a parent's ""tough love"", when in reality it just ended messing me up almost completely instead of helping, but from that parent's perspective they were trying to help me out of afection. They were not helping, they were wrong, but I can say that they _did_ love me. The problem is they were pretty messed up themselves, and not in a mental illness kind of way (alone) but in a ""something made me like this and I don't know any better"" kind of way. Thanos' motivations in the comics are slightly different, and perhaps that's what's missing from the movie adaptation, but in the comics he's also more of a black and white villain, which isn't as interesting. Yes, there will be kids or even adults who get a conflicting message from Thanos' portrail, but I think that will be solved in the sequel. We get terrible messages from media all the time, and several take us years to realize were the wrong kind of message (insert 80% of Disney movies with young women being rescued by rich princes who think the girl is pretty, thus making them marriage material right here). 
But the last movie is around the corner, and we have to give the film makers a chance to clear it up. After all, we're still on the side of the good guys here, not Thanos' side. As for those youtube videos defending him, there are flat earth videos all over youtube as well. The interpretation of information depends on the person at the receiving end, and if when all evidence points to the contrary, a few people still think we're on a disk and not an obloid sphere, that's not the evidence's fault.
In any case, I always apreciate your videos and insight (which most of the time forces me to look at stuff from a new perspective), so you get an upvote.

"Fantastic video as always. You do such a good job putting your thoughts into words (and images? idk man!) I don't totally agree, and I think the source of that disagreement stems from seeing Thanos as less empathetic than you. I didn't interpret the film as supporting Thanos's conclusion or methods; likewise, I didn't see it as implying that Thanos's love was real. Indeed, Gamora (who the audience actually *does* like) explicitly calls him out on this.

Thanos is empathetic in that his goal is at least somewhat understandable (especially compared to some Marvel villains, whose aims aren't more complex than ""destroy the world""), and he's mildly interesting in that *he* believes his abuse is real love.

That said, the point about children -- especially abused children -- seeing the film hit me really hard. I think it's totally fair to say that the film does not go far enough to condemn Thanos, especially for its core audience (y'know, kids?) who might not be mature enough to draw those conclusions.",0,0,2018-08-31T13:42:04.000Z

"(Please read to the end.)
People don't have as many kids as they did in the 70's.

I mostly agree with you in your videos but I have completely opposite opinions to you about TLJ and this movie. While I think TLJ was a dumpster fire that made no sense, was unfaithful to the themes and point of Star Wars and the previous movies and was just flat out boring, I adored Infinity War.

Thanos's whole character, including his abuse and plan, are ment to show the danger of basing morality on logic instead of compassion.
Case in point, everyone gets the goal of Thanos's plan wrong. As populations grow, resources grow more scarce. This fuels competition for those resources, which leads to war. That war DESTROYS the resource generation capacity of the population, which leads to the death of the whole system.
This can be observed (in part) with terrariums or sea monkey habitats. Once the animals consume the plants too quickly then they won't be able to replace themselves fast enough to the point that eventually the last plant will be eaten before the last sea monkey is dead.

The common objection to this is ""just double the resources"", which is absolutely stupid. Where would they go? If you double the planet size, the gravity would kill everything, if you make gravity weaker, the atoms would dissolve, if you make copy of every planet, where does the copy go and who goes to what planet? If you make the solar systems and galaxies bigger to fit these extra planets then you have the same gravitational problem on a much larger scale, ect.
As you can see Thanos's plan has a lot of logic to it because it keeps society intact, progress and resource generation capacity isn't lost. You won't have the same problem in 30 years because the fertility rate is not what it  was back then. Nowadays the global average fertility rate is about at the replacement rate of 2.1, which means if you were to  cut the Earth's population in half today, it would grow to and stay around 5-6 billion for the foreseeable future. His plan is also also devoid of compassion.

For the abuse I see two layers. One, it shows how Thanos's philosophy applies to relationships, he does whatever gets the result he wants, including torture. He sees no conflict in love without compassion.
Second, people aren't always logical. Despite going through abuse, especially from a parental figure, as I can attest to from personal experience, there is a complex mixture of love and hate this betrayal and manipulation causes. It doesn't behave the way you think it should and is messy. I saw Gamora collapsing after finally killing Thanos as a mixture of relief that this was finally over, grief over her lost family and years and perhaps some pain for losing her ""surrogate"" father as well. That's pretty meaningful if you ask me.

In a movie this big they can't give equal time to everyone so this movie chose to focus on the characters that actually have a significant stake in the Thanos plot, effectively making it simultaneously a Thor 4, Iron Man 4 and Gaurdians 3, with other characters being supporting roles. The emotional weight of all three of these character arcs failing to defeat Thanos was something I personally loved and felt earned because they all legitimately tried their best in every respect, and they still failed. Talk about being relatable. How many times has that happened to you?

I also don't think the movie is dangerous (where did that come from?) people aren't going to be exclusively shopping at Hot Topic and cutting themselves because Loki died or Groot disappeared into dust.

They actually take time to explain why he got to his logic and I just think people have a hard time accepting that because we see flaws in it, but that's the point. We don't like Thanos because we see the flaws, we know what he is putting everyone through will never truly fix the problem and that's why the ending leaves such a sour taste in our mouths.

"No.  The movie does not justify abuse with love.  If you're really thinking that, then you're not only watching the movie wrong, you're absorbing entertainment wrong.

To make that argument, you need to forget a very key element of storytelling that a lot of people don't even think about because it's so common across the world:

THE VILLAIN IS THE ONE WHO IS WRONG.  

Not the antagonist.  The Villain.  Sometimes, the Villain is the protagonist.  This is why Hero, Villain, Protagonist and Antagonist are all utterly divorced from each other, and always have been.  It's just that Hero and Protagonist are usually married up, just as Antagonist and Villain are usually married up.  But they are all separate character traits, regardless of usual execution.

Thanos is the villain.  He is wrong.  He is insane.  He is abusing everybody around him because he believes he's the only one with the answer.  Gamora even reminds him that he's wrong, that no matter how he's twisted it, what he feels for her is not love, his plan is monstrous and insane, and he's the villain in the story.  It is beaten over the audience's heads ""This guy does not have the answer, he just thinks he does.""  Then we get a rarity: the villain's plan is followed through.  We're given gut punch after gut punch to hammer home the fact that this was the WRONG THING TO DO.  Everything Thanos did to get to this point was the WRONG THING TO DO.

That's not justification.  It's condemnation.",474,86,2018-08-31T13:34:35.000Z

"Hey, man. Loved the video as always, even though I think much more favorably of the movie. Just one thing I'd like to add is that it seems to me that Thanos really is a character that should be discussed through film. It's true that his plan doesn't make sense - and I don't support the idea that it's supposed to be dumb - but I would say that the fact so many people agreed with him says a lot about our society. About people who want to do what they think is right, and are blinded by misinformation (I don't agree with the premise that Thanos is mentally ill, just a bad ""person""). This kind of wrong doing is not only fresh, after ages of Hitler-like villains, but also reflects a specific kind of real life harm, one very present in the Trump era. But what guides my opinion the most about Infinity War at this point is that it's only half of the story. So far, I think the story has presented us only its premises, and none of the conclusions, which might lead us somewhere completely different. For that, I'll just point to Wisecrack and a video they made trying to predict Avengers 4 based on the film's philosophy. Keep up the good work, man!",0,0,2018-08-31T13:32:59.000Z
"Yeah- I was able to go with the movie- but out of alllll the Marvel properties it was weak. I think what makes me feel more and more ""eh"" about the movie is just how many people say Thanos is correct.

The distaste that someone deciding to take it upon himself to kill half of all the people of the universe- randomly, is being supported by so many has retroactively made me dislike the movie a bit more. 

It's the only one I can honestly say I could never watch again and be fine with.

I mean, I feel pretty much all the deaths will be undone next movie- my brain is actually boggled by people freaking out and thinking these people will be dead forever-

But to me what happens next movie is irrelevant- the reaction to Thanos in THIS movie tells me more about the mindsets of way too many people around me, and it makes me feel really disheartened and disturbed.

Again, if Thanos was using DeathNote-esque logic where yes, he was killing pretty much half the people on a planet but was using a moral judgement to do so- say targeting whatever groups were stockpiling food and causing the starvation of others- THEN we could have a moral debate about it.

I feel all the people who are saying ""THANOS IS RIGHT"" would feel differently if it was say- their parents or children melting in front of their faces. It's easy to claim he's right when it's being done to OTHERS, and it's true people like simple answers to complicated issues. The combination of that makes me unable to watch it again.

For me real life people (not you), have ruined the movie for me, making me go from ""it's ok"" to ""God this whole thing disgusts me"".

And I feel they go too far trying to make Thanos seem, sympathetic- while he's being a horrible abuser with a God complex too. Even without changing how he sees things, it seems to me the movie tries too hard to make people go ""Oh- but his heart is in the right place""... which may be a sore spot for me because I've seen abusers of people I love be pillars in the community, and have claims be ignored because ""Oh- he can't be that bad, his heart is in the right place""- which of course makes me feel nothing but contempt and revultion when watching the movie as well...",10,23,2018-08-31T13:31:12.000Z
"Personally I never felt like the film was trying to get us on the side of Thanos. I think it was trying to make us understand why he is doing what he's doing, but at no point did I ever think the movie wants him to succeed. And no I don't think he's crazy or anything like that. Is he an abuser, yes. Can an abuser believe that they love the person they abuse? Probably. Living beings aren't always 100% rational. Doesn't make it okay or right obviously, but I never felt like the movie was trying to do that personally. Also about the whole ""it ruined Ragnarok"" thing, I'm fairly certain Thanos didn't kill all of them. Considering we didn't see Valkyrie or Korg (who isn't technically Asgardian but still) I think they got away and I'd need to go back and look to be 100% sure but I think somewhere in the film its mentioned that half of the people on the ship got away.

And this is in a Disney movie. Talk about a break from tradition.

Maybe what we're getting at here is a more nuanced understanding of the interpretation of the words that we use - the idea that love is not always a positive thing. Then again, this might be confirmation bias on my part, since I already believed the statement.

And it's not just because of the whole ""kill half, so the rest can live"" deal"", it's because we, the audience are only ever told why Thanos wants to do this. The movie doesn't take the time for you to see Thanos in his home world, to see how overpopulation is slowly ruining things, how they tried every other option before stumbling upon this desperate move. He just tells us why. 

And again, having a bonkers villain is fine. There are plenty of warped baddies who do what they do because they see themselves working for the greater good. But I can't remember the last time in which the villain was basically the protagonist. Honestly, they would've been better off if he just a blood-hungry genocidal super monster.

I was actually surprised with some of the earlier deaths in the film in terms of how it raised the stakes [albeit, completely crippling franchises like Thor and Guardians].

They will find a way to undo this disaster, the money train will keep on rolling, and all these world-ending stakes will mean nothing in the big picture. 



And the thing is, the whole MCU, with every new character and end credit teaser has been building to this moment for a decade. So now that it's here, what do you do? It'd be a good place narratively to end things, but that will never happen, so all they can do is build up to the next event.

"Hi,

I want to start off by saying I fully appreciate your position.  I even had to really think about it because my spouse had to walk out on it for a lot of the reasons you stated.  I think one of the problems is that the Avengers tent pole team movies try to respond to the meta-narrative around them (Full credit to Bob Chipman for that)

Avengers 1 -  Putting all those heroes together won't work  = Loki saying you gathered those heroes to stop me, it won't work, movie resolution it did specatcularly
Avengers 2 - Superheroes are unsustainable and should be replaced by something new = The Avengers can't stop everything and we should make an AI to replace us -this turns out to be the worst solution and the only way to walk it back is to make a new Super Hero
Infinity War - There are too many characters in your universe since you started adding to it = There are two many people in the universe to sustain - end of movie they take away all the new characters do you feel better? 

Because they wanted the new characters to be taken away to feel like such a hit, they spent the movie kicking you around to make you more vulnerable to the knockout punch. Now All that being said I can say with total confidence that this could have been done without the dire tone you note here.  And it absolutely could have been done without the abuse = love stuff.  Gamora having any affection for Thanos is especially unearned because, and I say this as someone who has complicated feelings about someone who abused them, there was no sign of the behaviors that would have offset the abuse.  There's no good Thanos time shown.  If he was built up as someone who actually had repeatedly failed to find other solutions for the lack of resources and then turned at some point that would have made a lot of the other stuff they noted more powerful.",0,0,2018-08-31T13:07:27.000Z

"""Ooooo, yeah....ummm, I'm gonna have to go ahead and sort of disagree with you there."" Thanos is not the protagonist, he's the antagonist and those have accomplished their goals in other movies too so just because he wins in this movie doesn't make him the protagonist. He's the villain so the abuse = love crap is something a villain my do with their mental gymnastics. You can see similarities to this with Gul Dukat from Star Trek DS9 and if you search youtube you will see similar videos about how he was a compelling villain. Quill doesn't show ownership of her; he talks like a boyfriend from the 70's earth would have but you grew up during idiotic SJW times so you wouldn't know about this apparently. Protip- women don't want you to unironically address them as M'lady. It seems that you're projecting whatever trauma happened to you onto this movie and this review is your chance to ""fight back"". I'm not going to be a grumpy bitch and downvote but I just disagree with this take. Hope you work through your demons my dude.",0,0,2018-08-31T13:05:35.000Z

"I'm happy that you turned on the comments for this one. I do hope that there won't be many of that type of people who made you turn them off in the first place. And if there will be I hope that you will be all right and able to just dismiss them as comments from people who can't distinguish giving their own opinion from personal attacks.

That being said I don't completely agree with you on Infinity War. I kind of feel that some Guardians weren't represented perfectly (Drax and Mantis). On the other hand I think that Quill's behavior is in line with his growth, mainly because a significant part of his character journey was to become more matured emotionally (as you said in the video), and his actions in the movie ARE in my opinion of a person who finally is more in thouch with his feelings and someone who tried to build a healthy attachment to Gamora. As to your argument that he claims ""ownership"" over Gamora based on how he refers to her, I think it's more because he is in distress and can't find more eloquent and proper way to say that (after all he isn't that bright, not stupid though, I don't mean that). So his choice to punch Thanos comes from a place of deep pain, suffering, regret and helplesness, as opposed to cold and logical calculation.

As to the abuse=love thing that you stated, it really didn't occur to me that someone might read Thanos's actions that way. The way I see it though is that he really DOES love Gamora, just not the same way as an actually good parent would, which makes him a bad role model for his ""children"", who, as we see in the previous movies and Infinity War, formed their own viewpoints of his person (except the Black Order, but they are fanatical proteges who clearly followed him for a long time now and he has given them a taste of power, and power corrupts). Gamora and Nebula hate Thanos, but Gamora seems to still have some form of love towards him, though it's hidden very deeply and only surfaces when she KILLS her father, and even though he was a horrible person someone who is actually a pretty sensitive person (and we can see throughout the movies that, despite her tough appearance, she is quite sensitive). Besides Gamora herself doesn't believe that Thanos really loves her (""This isn't love."" she says on Vormir). And before anyone says ""but then if Thanos's love for her is questioned why does he get the stone?"", I think it is because HE really believes that he loves her, in his own twisted way.

And that brings me to Thanos's plan and why, despite its flaws and being illogical, it still works as with his character. Thanos, even though he is powerful, is a broken man, with a somewhat bent moral code. He was clearly damaged from the beggining, but seeing his whole planet suffer from what he thought could be avoided finally casted him into obsession (not madness in my opinion, because that is a lazy excuse, and I'm not sure if anyone in the movie ever calls him the Mad Titan). That obsession clouded his judgment and he desperately wanted to prove to himself that he was right up to the point when he disregarded every other option. That's why he doesn't even think about any other use for a full Gauntlet, because at this point it isn't really about helping others, it's about reassuring himself that he is the only one with the solution. And finally, after he achieved his grand goal, even though he lightly smiles in the end, before that he experiences doubt and even (to some extent) regret when he sees Gamora as a child and to her question ""What did it cost?"" he answers quiely and shakily, with sadness and deep pain resonating in his voice ""Everything..."". I think (and hope) that we have yet to see him realizing what he had done and what were the actual consequences to his actions (both large scale as well as personal, his and other people).

I myself am not sure how to view this movie It definately could have been better, it isn't the best MCU movie (Civil War all the way! I recently rewatched it and damn, that movie is emotional) and I'm not sure that Thanos is the best MCU villain, at least not for now (we'll see what happens in A4). It's good that there are people out there who criticize it for reasons more reasonable that ""it's jus another dumb blockbuster"" or ""it didn't make sense and wasn't logical"". Constructive criticism is always great (though I do think that at some points in this video, intentionally or not the jokes and slight ridicule weaken your arguments and make it seem as you just make fun of some aspects of the movie.

"I think you are wrong on the issue of Thanos and Gamora as well as the person you cited in the video. The issue of Abuse is much more complex than the manner in which you are portraying it. The reality is that abusers can and often do love the people they abuse. Abusers are broken and often do not know how to grapple with the feelings and conflicts they experience.  There is no dichotomy between the two as they are not opposites. Your vision of love and abuse is a simplistic one. 

The film in no way glorifies this abuse, it is clearly portrayed to be horrible and that the things Thanos does are unforgivable.",788,44,2018-08-31T13:01:15.000Z
I feel like Killmonger was a genocidal dude who was framed just as sympathetically as Thanos. Why doesnt he have as many video essays?,2,1,2018-08-31T12:59:17.000Z
"I think you can empathize with someone without justifying their actions.

For example: it’s possible to empathize with a criminal due to whatever circumstances led them to that path (poverty, being unjustly fired, etc.) However, that doesn’t mean that we could ever justify it at all. So Thanos is empathetic imo in the sense that he saw his planet collapse and wants to spare other planets and people the same fate, but I also acknowledge that he’s a freaking psycho so yeah I don’t have any sympathy Grimace. I also agree with your point about him loving Gamora. In his mind he does in some twisted way (even if his love itself isn’t twisted, the way he loves and the circumstances in which it manifested DEFINITELY is.) Also she probably loves him in some twisted way because we love our family no matter how messed up and horrible they may be (ask Thor.) Again, it’s DEFINITELY not justified but it has its own logic and, when viewed that way, is pretty Shakespearian.

Also I didn’t love Peter Quill’s portrayal in this film, but here’s something I thought of that might explain it at least a bit:

In Guardians 1 he learns to let other people share his pain and become part of a group. In Guardians 2 he learns to become equal with that group. At the end he embraces the parental role he plays in Groot’s life along with the others. In this movie, PERHAPS he’s acting like a cocky idiot because he’s taking his role as a guardian (to everyone now not just Groot) too seriously. Men tend to get beside themselves when their families are messed with and can do impulsive things. He acts self conscious around Thor because he likely feels inferior in terms of masculinity. He lashed out at Thanos because he was protective of her and “family first yoo!” I mean he had no reason to care about Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Doctor Strange. For him they were just a means to him getting a dialogue and possibly killing the guy who screwed with his family and took the woman he loves. THEY’RE his main focus, not three strangers.

Hopefully the next movie he learns to be a Guardian to everyone and not just those he knows personally. If not then I’ll be annoyed. Drax obviously learned to hold his composure, unfortunately Peter didn’t. I mean that look on his face after Thanos leaves is of pure, genuine remorse, so I hope he got the point.",0,0,2018-08-31T12:57:37.000Z

"I appreciate your take, and you make some excellent points.

Here is the thing about the character Thanos, and why I fundamentally disagree with you. It is really hard to say he is mentally ill. At least not mental illness as a hindrance to functioning in society. He is the worst actor in a social space, the type that adheres to a monstrous philosophy and coldly and rationally carries it out. 

It is easy in comics to say, ""well the riddler is crazy, that's why he is robbing a bank!"" it is harder to cope with a man with a philosophy that hurts people that other people follow, almost with devotion. This is not something new to history. Thanos is essentially the worst part of people, he is an abuser, he is power hungry, he feels he can force his will on to a universe, all they while thinking he is right. Every time he is confronted in the film with a choice where he can stop and do the right thing he pushes past it, as if his will to succeed is some sort of noble virtue. 

I get the arguments about this being a multi part movie, in a multi part series, but I would argue that Infinity War does make a statement about Thanos, and men like him. He wins in the film, he gets what he set out to do leaving a wake of death and destruction to do so, and in the final moments you see the results.

And it is awful.

The movie makes a definitive statement. When men like Thanos get their way, the results are tragic. The result is the loss of friends and family. The results are somber and real. 

If the movie ended with the results of the Mad Titan leaving the world in a better place, then yeah, I would hold Marvel to task for making everything else that he does in that movie justified. But it doesn't. We are left with this horrible feeling of emptiness. Questioning what was it all for. And that is the ultimate message of the movie.",622,29,2018-08-31T12:55:38.000Z

"People do have complex emotional bonds with parental figures that abused them. Love can be toxic, and corrosive. Love can be ugly. People who have experienced prolonged abuse can find themselves being bad at relationships because the foundational template for love is not something fit for disney. Which brings me to there being two kinds of movies. The aspirational movies, and the reflective movies. Disney movies are generally aspirational. This is how we would like the world to be, and how we would like to be. Reflective movies draw not from the external, but from the internal, and are generally speaking personal, are drawn from deeply personal experiences which gives them the ring of the lived and true, and that can be very disturbing. 

Remember that Eminem and Rihanna music video for the song ""Lie To Me""? It was about a really troubled relationship. At the time it was framed as an abusive relatinship, but I think people got confused by the wifebeater Dominic Monaghan was wearing. If you want to frame it as abusive, then they are both being abusive to each other. At the time this came out it made some waves, being seen as either transgressive or as being a bad influence. I think the value proposition here is missed. Aspirational media shows us how things could be, if things were different. Reflective media shows us that we are not alone. That our experiences, no matter how fucked up and out there and alien seeming, we're not alone. I think the Eminem music video has done a million times more to help people who are in painful relationships full of crazy intensity, drama and pain than the million morning shows othering the people with those experiences by simply proclaiming those experiences as bad and wrong. It's fine if you don't want to see that in a Marvel movie, but the people who have cried over the broken love they felt for a person that abused them after they freed themselves of them are legion. Showing that isn't bad. Framing that as harmful is kind of fucked up. What the Russo brothers did here is the opposite of the erasure, the alienating and othering of the children in the audience that are in a situation of abuse that Disney tends to engage in.

Let me put it this way. If we only paint pretty pictures, what are we telling the children whose lives aren't that? If we're telling them THIS IS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE all we're doing is injecting more shame into an already shameful experience. If the discussion about toxic, fucked up broken love is taboo, if we are denouncing it by saying it does not exist, does that make it more or less likely that someone overhearing that  is going to reach out? Aspirational media has it's place, but so does reflective media. Fucked up shit makes people whose lives are filled with fucked up shit feel like they are among the counted, and that is something that matters.",0,0,2018-08-31T12:47:45.000Z

How is that balance? 

Also according to the directors or someone else equally important Thanos not only halved half of all sentient life, but also of the non-sentient life, like plants and animals. So he halved the people so that there'd be more resources for everyone.... and then also halved said resources because balance....?

"Thank you for sharing your honest opinion, regardless of how people might react to it.  You are a braver man than me in a lot of ways, especially considering the whole Get off the Floor... thing...

That said, I think I still like this movie, and I still like Thanos.  Maybe that's too heavily influenced by just how many terrible villains there are in these popcorn flicks (freaking Steppenwolf still makes me angry and bored at the same time), but this was the first time I actually CARED about the 'evil' guy's motivations and goals to any significant degree.  Plus, I think having the bad guy be the protagonist was just a good way to hold together a horde of good guys who are all used to being the heroes of their own stories.  I think it would be unsatisfying to have anyone else be the 'main' character, even Stark.

I'm sure that Josh Brolin's impressive performance also drew me to him, but none of these things invalidate your opinion.

It never fails to blow my mind to hear how differently people can react to the same things I see, especially when trauma is involved.  Your entire world is different than mine, and I have to try to understand and accept that.  There is no right way to view this movie, and your takeaway is literally as true as mine.

As someone who never experienced any kind of significant abuse growing up, I can just accept that the characters feel the way the writers say they do.  It didn't bother me because it wasn't supposed to be 'good'.  I can believe that someone can feel awful for having to kill someone they didn't really like, but had grown up with.  I can believe that someone can feel sorrow for killing someone they raised, even if they were terrible to them in the process.  It's subjective, right?  His interpretation of 'love' was seriously messed up, but it can still feel real to him, can't it?  The soul stone seemed to think so.

Much like how some people's reaction to Guardians 2 was much stronger than mine.  Certain things, like Lindsay Ellis' review, really opened my eyes.  Some people related strongly, while I didn't really feel anything about the ending, at least, until they made the CGI raccoon cry, and... yeah.

Anyways, I just want to congratulate you on a job well done, and thank you for giving me some real food for thought.  Even when I don't agree with everything you say, I'll always appreciate that you said it.",1,0,2018-08-31T12:38:03.000Z

About ""love"" that you criticised, not all types of love is healthy for you, and the movie show this abundantly clear, not ever show that the relationship between Thanos and Gamorra was good, healthy or something you desire for yourself.

"Two details... James Gunn worked closely with the Russo Brothers on the Guardians dialog even directly writing some of it himself specifically in order to get the 'tone' correct. 

While I don't disagree that Peter Quill... regressed, when I watched the film, I got the impression that he was having a difficult time dealing with the progression in his relationship with Gamora. This is a type of behavioral pattern I've seen in my life and my friends lives so while it was incredibly stupid, it didn't seem all that unusual to me.

As for the film and Thanos himself,  when you asked for a 2 word review on Twitter, my 2 words were subverting expectations. If I'd expanded that to 5 words it would have read ""subverting expectations to meet expectations"". This wasn't a film. It was a spectacle in film format which is a subtle but extremely important difference. This spectacle was always supposed to end with the fanatical abuser losing, his ideas of love and responsibility to the universe found to be losing formula. In thinking about your points, I fall back on something I've said for many years which is that most of humanity isn't emotionally advanced enough to handle these complex concepts beyond 'face value'.

"I can see your point. As well as respect it.  I think your point on mental illness is very valid, but within the flaws of the Marvel universe.  This wasn't the ""Mad"" Titan.  I can think of a lot of reasons why they didn't go with Thanos being in love with Death. But it was a mistake, the man is insane.  For the reason he wants to impress and make Death fall in love with him.  That idea and goal is what makes him crazy.  Marvel makes the mistake of not having a good villain, because they try to make them too human.   I call it the Dark Knight problem.  They want a villain like the Joker, but the Joker is his own special brand of crazy and amazing.  Personally I don't see the Dark Knight Joker as that good of a representation of the character.  I never saw Thanos as the abuser winning and showing how twisted his love was and the effect that could have.  But I do agree with you, and still think that if they made his reasoning for kiling half the universe.  Was because he was in love with Death, and wanted her to love him back.  Without showing us Death just have him kinda talking to air and even maybe snapping at Peter.  For killing Gamora, while saying something along the lines of him not understand love.  That he knows love and then he snaps his fingers blah blah blah.  That would of been a powerful, terrifying, impactful villain.  To anwser your question of where do we go from there. Imagine when Thanos is beat they show us the audience that Death is a ""real"" person.  Just watching with other cosmic being around her.  So we know there is a bigger world.

"I don't agree with a word of that but the video is incredibly well made. Sometimes entertainment can simply be entertainment without delving too deeply into the subject matter. Of course, universal genocide is bad, and of course abuse is bad but this is a fictional universe and should be taken as such.",23,5,2018-08-31T12:14:57.000Z
It's funny how Thano's character is designed to break the rules of the MCU. He's a layered  villain who actually wins in the end and is the focus of the film. He also made you break your rules and deliver a video that's mostly criticism. It's okay for the MCU to break the mold on occasion. If they don't then this comic book movie genre is going to die or get stale. Why is it not okay for a character in a film to get a strong reaction out of you. Film is supposed to make you feel things even MCU films.,241,19,2018-08-31T12:13:05.000Z

"Had never really considered why some parts of the movie felt uncomfortable to me, and this video has helped bring the reasons for that into focus. I still got several good kicks out of the movie, but I feel like it's important to have these kinds of viewpoints, and the comprehensive explanations of them, to give a full view of how others experienced the movie. Makes it all the more sad that people run around trying to say ""you're WRONG and here's WHY"" because it's not like Mikey's trying to tell us the movie was bad— it's really all about empathy. The point was made several times that the filmmakers were forcing empathy for a character who may or may not deserve it, and it seems like plenty of folks are willing to buy into it; yet nobody's willing to have the empathy to accept someone else's negative opinions about the film.

Thanks for the video.",174,10,2018-08-31T12:08:41.000Z
Was Infinity War divisive? I've mostly only heard praise for it and people compare it the Last Jedi as a better attempt at being the 'Empire' of the series.,140,17,2018-08-31T12:08:14.000Z

"Love your stuff, man, but as a huge Guardians fan, I still loved this film. What you feel about it is what you feel about it, and I get _why_ you feel that way, I empathize with those feelings, but ultimately I don't share them. I thought that the Guardians had some really great scenes through the movie, which supposedly were written by Gunn himself, so they should be consistent with his vision. I thought Rocket and Thor's scene was great, I thought Mantis and Nebula really had a lot more to work with than in GotG2. I thought that while Peter grew as a character, he still wasn't perfect, and would still be prone to making bad decisions in a crisis. As he did. Unless it was all part of Strange's plan. 

I think that the most important part of an analysis of this movie is that it's NOT a movie. It's _half_ a movie. They clearly designed it to not work on its own, to not ""conclude."" This is like TV, where you do a season ending cliffhanger where all is ruined, and then you fix it in the next one. The ""snap"" ending wasn't designed to provoke wallowing in darkness for years, it was just a brief shock to the system. They know full well that the audience has been deliberately conditioned to the impermanence of the stakes, that we know full well that they aren't going to permanently kill off Peter Parker and T'Challa and Doctor Strange, when they all have sequels planned. They know that when we see a character die, no matter how clearly, our initial reaction will be ""oh, he's coming back."" The ending worked, because for just a brief moment, the audience in my theater, myself included, went ""oh my God!"" in a way that we rarely do in a film, it was like cresting a roller coaster, the sense of the bottom dropping out as you start to fall, but then your mind quickly overcomes your lizard brain, and you realize you aren't going to fall to your death, it'll work out. They just calibrated that one moment of awe, knowing that we would trust them to fix it next year. 

As for Thanos, I have faith they'll resolve it. I feel like we only got half the story with him. Yes, this movie was his ""happy ending,"" but we know that it was only half the story. If the second film doesn't adequately address your criticisms, then I'm 80% behind your analysis, it did a bad job of portraying mental illness and abuse. But I have faith that they will fix it. I have faith that the second film will confront the happy lies he tells himself. I do believe that abusive parents can have a form of love in them, and that the children of abuse can have a form of love, but that does not justify the abuse, and that lesson needs to be made clear both to him and to the audience. Thanos did have a bad plan, but it was a plan he believed in. Plenty of people believe in bad plans. The second film will need to address this as well, hopefully by pointing out that his strategy was a delusion, that it never worked as well as he'd believed it had, similar to the illusions he made with the Reality gem. 

I really do have a lot of faith in the next film, and chances are it will at least partially disappoint me, but I just can't criticize certain aspects of _this_ film too harshly, when I know for a fact that the story isn't yet finished.",324,13,2018-08-27T08:53:55.000Z
