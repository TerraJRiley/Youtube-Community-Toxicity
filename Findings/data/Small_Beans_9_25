"I think you guys missed the main point of the movie which is simply a father struggling to come to terms with his daughters sexuality. As this is something I'm struggling with personally, the movie had resonance with me. Which is not to say it had answers or promoted good behavior, unless it was illustrating what NOT to do. I think this movie is being universally viewed through a prism of bias and used as evidence in the court of public opinion. What Luis did was grotesque, but mostly sad and pathetic. It certainly doesn't deserve to be conflated with the actions of Cosby, Weinstein or Allen. Divorcing the art from the artist is a difficult subject that needs to be explored maturely. We all certainly adulate some artist that has committed deplorable acts but was never caught. What if a felon was released from prison and wrote an amazing book? Would we be compelled to dislike it based on their past transgressions? What if the felon had written it before prison, would we be allowed to appreciate their work again upon release of prison? Or does the art become a unique entity that is owned by the viewer and not subject to the sins of the father?

"The Civil War in this game has so many crannies it's crazy; it's not really fair to be quite so dismissive, as there's much more to it than ""Ulfric is a shit, so side with the other guys."" I get that you don't have forever to talk about it, and the game IS almost a decade old at this point, but let's try to give the setting its due.

On the one hand, the Empire is a little bit (or well, lotta bit) too zealous in their attempts to squash the rebellion because they're clearly willing to execute arguably/potentially innocent people - like the player character and random horse thieves - just because it gives them a chance to chop Ulfric's head off. And instead of immediately going for him first, General Tullius is willing to sorta stand there and save him for last, presumably gloating over their victorious ambush while going, ""Now look at your people be slaughtered and watch your rebellion burn."" Not that the rebellion isn't absolutely moronic, all considering; the White-Gold Concordat is pretty much the only thing keeping a fractured province from being curb-stomped by the Thalmor, so it's really in everyone's best interest to unify against this threat of impending doom, whether the Imperial Legion are misguided and a borderline dictator-army or not. Granted there are plenty of good soldiers like Hadvar, and following the Legion basically sends you down the path of ""for the greater good of the people,"" but you can't help but wonder at the end of this story arc if all your efforts were wasted on prolonging the slow death of a government that's been on its last legs for ages. (The going theory is that even the Emperor himself knows he and his subordinates are so unpopular that only a total revamp/uprising can rescue them from the scrappy heap, which is why you can waltz in as a DB assassin and have him surrender so easily. It's basically like he planned your ""visit"" himself).

On the other hand, if you decide (for some unfathomable reason) to not follow the assholes who just tried to unjustly decapitate you for the crime of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you follow along with Ulfric's rebellion and ultimately uncover the story of a man who desperately wants to be High King because he wants to preserve the honor, integrity, and cultural traditions of his people, particularly their right to worship whomever they choose. It's true he has a personal vendetta against the Thalmor and their allegiance with the Legion, because he got royally shafted after rescuing Markarth from the Reachmen/Forsworn armies still claiming The Reach as theirs; he (and the countless soldiers sacrificing their lives) was promised the freedom to worship Talos in exchange for his assistance, only to be blamed for the whole agreement (and decidedly not given what he was promised) once the Thalmor found out about the Legion's shady deal. Furthermore, the Thalmor claim that Talos is a false god is, well, false. Tiber Septim really DID ascend to godhood after all his monumental deeds, and his people have every right to worship him as they please. On the other hand, joining the Stormcloaks quickly makes you realize that for all their demanding of their civil rights, they're not generally respectful of the rights of other races; they're by and large a ""for the NORDS"" faction, which means most of them are quite a lot racist, and equally unsympathetic, making one wonder if their legendary stubbornness and hypocrisy are worth the hassle.

Then again... One could make the argument that this whole ordeal is just a result of the Thalmor being dickheads on a power trip, who are just as racist toward non-Mer as the Stormcloaks generally behave toward non-Nords. After all, they do consider all Elves superior to the races of Men (and the Altmer superior to all other races of Mer), which comes off as a load of hogwash when the player can mop the floor with dozens of them in mere minutes, even with the magic they're allegedly so proficient at using. Of course, one has to remember that the Dragonborn is a cosmic anomaly; they literally have the soul of a god inside them. And with this superiority in mind, one would do well to further keep in mind that the Mer are direct descendants of the Aedra (with Altmer claiming the purest heritage), who generally live hundreds of years, and are capable of research and innovations that Men and Beastfolk can't hope to match. So maybe there's some truth to the superiority complex after all? (Especially if the Dragonborn IS an Altmer, because that would almost singlehandedly prove their point). And if you really stop to think about it, you can't really blame them for being mad about the whole Talos thing, since Tiber Septim went on a wild tear through their homeland, decimating THEIR culture and THEIR innocent people in the name of conquest, and he used ""L33t hax0r sk1llz"" to accomplish it; since this is a universe where a god's power is directly proportionate to their masses of worshipers, is it any wonder they'd try and make him fade into obscurity (and consequently cease to exist)?

TL;DR - At the end of the day, you have a war where all three factions are kinda justified, but also kinda sucky, and there's really no satisfying solution to the problem. Each side has its share of awful people, but the Stormcloaks arguably have the most - unless you count the Thalmor hanging around to play the Imperial Legion like a fiddle so that they can swoop in and, rightfully or not, destroy mankind.

"Hans Landa didn‚Äôt kill Von-Hammersmark because she betrayed her country. Even if he led her to think that before he strangled her. 

Think about it!

Landa killed BVH because she slighted HIM. He knew she was involved with the Basterds and confronted her about her Cast. The second she made up a story about why her leg was injured, Landa was laughing for show.

The laugh was for the room and for the mind game, but he was obviously insulted by her pathetic attempt to fool him as a detective. He is confident and proud of his ability as a puzzle solver. When she lied to him, he was utterly insulted that she would even try to lie when he already knew the truth.

Landa was ready to betray his country yes. But NO ONE KNEW THAT BUT HIM. So when he killed her it wasn‚Äôt for betraying the NAZI‚Äôs, it was for underestimating him! He already showed how proud he was of his ability. He shows it again when he‚Äôs insulted by Aldo not knowing who he is.

"I about half way through this video and I'm so very sad. As I've said in every comment I've written in the last few hours I was late to the game finding this channel and I'm so devastated you guys were going through such stressful and trying times. I've enjoyed your content for so long and there was a long period of time where everytime there was a cracked upload, no matter what it was I was so excited. I started off with the cracked website. I would visit it every day and when I found out you had videos it wasn't even through YouTube, it was after hours posted to the website and i loved most everything posted. And all I wanted was to see more DoB, soren, the Katy's, and Swain acting and performing and writing videos and eventually I got to love the other faces like Alex and cody but watching this makes me sad because all the videos I still watch on repeat today are possibly videos that sapped your creative abilities and that you had stopped enjoying making. I wanted more after hours because I thought you enjoyed making them as much as I loved watching them. I didnt realize the emotional toll. I mean your personalities and humor and insights are enough to keep me interested and I'm just glad you've opened up so much on this podcast. This is a bit rambly but I want you know that I (and many others) could listen to you for hours just talking. About your futures, fears, the industry, and climate of the industry moving forward.  You have so many good insights and I know you probably dont like getting this personal but I'm very grateful you did.

"Ok DoB. I get your plug point but as a person who loved cracked, has watched every after hours, live podcast, excessive pop culture disorder and discussion,  and every cracked presents sketch multiple times, and doesn't have any social media besides facebook, it's really hard to figure out what our favorite cracked people are doing nowadays. I found this channel last week because cracked uploaded a people watching episode and someone commented about it. It was really nice to plug that swaim podcast (will watch btw) but some of us really miss you and dont have an easy way to find you again. I've seen it commented on this and other small beans videos. Help us find you.  all DAY! all DAY! all DAY! (Hp parody sketch reference that plays in my head repeatedly all DAY! Im not your savior) also that last part discussing how DoB hadn't seen swaim in months broke my heart,  I shed a tear. They all worked so closely together for so many years and worked so hard on their website and video content and were mercilessly thrown out for stupid reasons. I mean I just finished reading every cracked presents and DoB and Swaim together in Agents of Cracked and hearing what DoB said at the end. Just heart breaking I wish we could help them rebuild a better cracked,  called broked.com.

"Michael, your argument sounds like it boils down to ""I don't think this thing, x, is very good because it's not as good as this other thing, y - that built off of x's primordial foundation - is, nor is it as good as it could hypothetically possibly be. (And I'm judging it out of the context of its time, after decades have passed.)"" This is technically true, but is - in a pragmatic sense - worthless for the purpose of judging the works that exist and recommending some of them to people over other works of the same genre/medium.

I could just as easily say ""Eh, Rembrandt is fine, but he doesn't use color as well as color could be used. His paintings are the Sepia-filtered instagram photos of the 18th century."" The first sentence is technically true, unless everything he saw was caked in a fine layer of dust. But that doesn't change the fact that his paintings were excellent for their time. 
Is it not a simple fact that things develop over time? Can only new things be good? Can we not recognize a classic when we see it? Or can only the latest and greatest triumph be considered a classic?

I'm not a Halo fanboy. I haven't played all of the Halo titles, and Halo: Combat Evolved isn't my favorite game or even my favorite video game. I think you make some decent points in this episode. But I also think that your criteria for judgment are very, VERY idiosyncratic, and removed from how most other people judge video games (if not art in general) and how they recommend or advise against other people consuming those media. 

But that's just my opinion, and I could be wrong.",0,0,2018-09-08T00:22:36.000Z,chris logan,UCM0aRLy6vrb-DLu-318-MBA,AGYPREcpX3A,True,Ugxltzfh1TooRN5WAbl4AaABAg

"Halo 1 really adhered to the ""Rock-Paper-Scissors"" style of weapon design: every weapon had a role in which is most effective in and a weapon it is most weak against. Bungie made a conscious decision to eliminate or differentiate  duplicate weapons. The plasma rifle and assault rifle are similar in that that are both ""spray and pray"" medium-range weapons, but the former is more effective against shields and the latter against armor/flesh. With the two-weapon limit, learning which weapons had more utility in what situations was fun, but the limited selection of weapons kept it from being overwhelming.

"Not sure how I stumbled here, and since it's old I'd just like to chime in on one point, and that's that problem drinking is pretty much without exception due to depression - this is something I rail against regularly. There's a big problem right now with public perception of depression and anxiety, and it's greatly exacerbated by misidentifying the causes of these symptom conditions. 

Whenever someone identifies an 'addiction' of a substance or behavior that is not actually addictive, it hurts both depression and addiction in a massive way. We know the origin of 'alcoholic' and 'alcoholism', and rather depressingly it's the same group of people who promote newer fake 'conditions' like 'porn addiction', 'sex addiction' and 'video game addiction'. It's the same conservative religious groups for all of these, and as such there's a moral judgement pervading the issues - they're essentially identifying 'sin'... heck often they'll say this explicitly. 

By continuing to give air to these false conditions we perpetuate the moral judgement that comes with it, and we perpetuate the disgusting practice of 'help groups' for these conditions, which unambiguously do not help the individuals, and typically serve only to proselytize and tell them that they're failures... which presents a serious suicide risk as well... really should be criminal but we're still giving religion a pass on all the kid fucking so maybe a bit early to expect justice.

You did a solid job of addressing the self-medicating aspect of alcohol, but the social perception problem goes even deeper and darker than that. There's really solid treatment out there for depression and anxiety, and there is a big problem all over the developed world with not enough people being medicated to assist in their quality of life... bah... unintentional rant.

"I am sorry, but Destiny is trash in my opinion.  There is literally not a single thing that it did that felt original.  The fallen might as well be the Grineer, the cabal are the corpus, and the hive are the infested or whatever.  Not to mention I don't care for their classes and subclasses.  I couldn't tell the difference between the three besides skill sets since my Titan seemed just as squishy as hunters or warlocks.  And, the open world was fun to explore until you find how caged you are IN SPACE!  No, Destiny is NOT important in any fashion or comparison.  Also, if those factions are so powerful why is there a tower?  If they are so weak, why the fuck haven't the characters beat them?  I am sorry, truly, but I don't see any originality or uniqueness that makes Destiny a good game.

And why did they go for classic classes yet ruin the sword wielding warrior?  Have the hunter be knives!  They are faster and if super heated can function BETTER than a sword.  Just saying that making Titans ""Thor"" with a small fire hammer VERY quickly got me angry more than forgive Destiny.  I literally came back to the game and hated the new subclass for Titans and I just quit.  The raids were EXTREMELY annoying for me because by the time my friends were playing them, I had dropped off from it.  Having to ONLY equip the EXACT weapons that everyone else thinks have to be used to win defeats the challenge in a game.  There was more joy playing other games and telling my friends that's why I don't play Destiny when they would complain about having to replay a raid over and over to get a drop.  The game was a boring loop of requiring you to have full teams or be a certain level to do damage even if your enemies are beyond the levels you can reach.  I have played games for challenge, but it isn't typically that shallow of a difficulty.

In Fallout 4, instead of being forced out you were frozen and held against your will while your son was kidnapped.  In my mind, those are the stories in Fallout 3 and 4.  You are a child searching for their parent or a parent searching for their child...  Maybe I missed something, but a part of me doesn't care for the Fallout games because they feel so disconnected in the same world making it hard to see the point in a lot of the choices made.

"Sorry. Had to give this a rare thumbs down. Not because you hated the movie, that's your opinion.

I gave it a downer because you were judging a 13 year-old movie based on your sensibilities today. I loved this movie when it came out and I was a teenager. It was raunchy and silly, and I still laugh at many of the lines today (yes, even the racist and misogynist ones). Also, it's a comedy, not a documentary; everything is made up. The characters say and do things to get a comedic reaction, not to fortify the patriarchy.

Also, you need someone in the room who can at least slightly defend the movie against your bashing. It's got an 85% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes for crying out loud.

"TL;DR: The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a satire and take-down of toxic masculinity, not a lionization of it.  Most (but not all) of the problematic stuff is supposed to be seen by the audience as problematic, and the main character only achieves happiness by ultimately disregarding all that problematic advice and taking rational, adult steps with another rational adult.

It's been a while since I watched 40-Year-Old Virgin and I'm sure many of the jokes have not aged well, but you guys are still taking this movie waaaaaay too much at face value.  And I don't mean ""it's just a comedy,"" or anything reductive like that, I mean you're missing the obvious subtext: that these people are horrible and their attempts to connect to others, either platoniclly or romantically, are doomed to failure because of their complete misunderstanding of how relationships work.  In other words, this is a work of satire and you evidently don't understand that.

Like, let's talk about Jay's line, ""there's a code written in every guy's DNA that says, 'tackle drunk bitches.'""  That's not supposed to be take as *true*.  Instead, it's supposed to be a tell that Jay is so drunk on toxic masculinity that he can't see out of it.  It's wildly, patently, obviously fucked up and wrong, and the movie lampshades this by having Andy directly call Jay out on it later when the guys push him to chat up drunk women.  Andy's basically a good guy whose character flaw is susceptibility to bad advice, but this particular advice is *so* bad and *so* offensive that he can't follow through with it.

In fact, virtually everything the guys tell Andy to do ends up backfiring on him one way or another.  The negging strategy works with Elizabeth Banks' character, but he ultimately realizes that that's not the kind of relationship he wants.  He gets together with Trish totally independently of their advice, and the advice they've given him and the pressure they've applied for him to have sex are what cause he and Trish to break up.  The conflict in their relationship is then relieved only when he's honest with Trish, in spite of his insecurities, and they have an adult conversation about what that means for their relationship.  *The point of the movie is that obsession with sex and losing one's virginity through any means possible is a symptom of toxic masculinity and it results in broken people.*

That said, I'm positive that many of the jokes are quite problematic in 2018.  The, ""you know how I know you're gay?"" section is largely a product of its time; it's supposed to show how hard it is for guys to express platonic intimacy, I guess, but we *are* meant to laugh with the homophobia.  It's nice that the cast is fairly diverse but you're right that that's mainly so they can excuse the racists jokes (though to be fair to Apatow and Carrell, I would be surprised if many/most of those weren't improvised by the actors).  There are other individual aspects that are problematic, to be sure, like how all the women are the same body type when the men are allowed to be whatever shape they want.  You're right that that's a serious issue that Hollywood still doesn't seem to be able to get around.

That said, while most of the female characters are crazy, so are most of the male characters, and in both cases, their mania seems to be mainly a product of desperation for intimacy.  We just see more behind-the-scenes for the male characters so they come off as more well-rounded, whereas with the women Andy's attempting to date, we just see the desperation itself.  Really, only Andy and Trish of the main cast come off as normal people at all, and of the secondary characters, only Kat Denning's Marla and Mindy Kaling's Amy are normal - notable, I think, since Andy gravitates towards Trish and Kat as the rational family unit he wants instead of the weird pickup artist / bar scene his coworkers push him towards, and Amy's normality really highlights how fucked up Paul Rudd is.  Her presence is supposed to be a slap in the audience's face that Rudd's character is not right and shouldn't be taken as an example of how to act.

This isn't especially deep stuff, my dudes.  It's right there, micrometers below the surface.  Maybe instead of worrying about Steve Carrell shouting expletives at another actor while they were both acting out a scene (the horror!), you could've taken a moment to try to remember whether satire was a thing.  Because as a satire, this movie comes darn close to being an outright morality play decrying toxic masculinity back when that term was mainly confined to academia.",12,3,2018-08-23T14:14:05.000Z,BlaineTog,UC7n6FLVIURzjAZBhZ3oeRXQ,Se4fcyQln0g,True,Ugw38dERx4_fFMd4iyZ4AaABAg

"New Vegas is Good.....But it Wouldn‚Äôt have Existed at all if not for the foundation built by Fallout 3.

Now don‚Äôt be so quick to twist those words in your head...Don‚Äôt be that asshole to say ‚Äúhurp hurp, if not for fallout 1 and 2 then....etc‚Äù. This would be a stupid Argument.

Fallout 1 and 2 set the world up for anything certainly. But if you skipped Fallout 3, the Fallout New Vegas would be some impossible to know piece of this puzzle! Without three, there would be no modern skeleton for dialogue, and graphics, and world rendering that we can imagine. 

If I can be more razor sharp in my assessment,....If there was no fallout 3, then you NV fans would have no Basis to assume it was better than.....well, than 3. 3 has to set the stage of Fallout-New Vegas would be COMPLETELY unrecognizable to you. 

So by that reasoning, I wonder if so many of you claim that Fallout-3 is ‚ÄúGarbage‚Äù, when your favorite wouldn‚Äôt EXIST without it....

And don‚Äôt even try to say I‚Äôm mad that you don‚Äôt like F3. That is FAR from the case. I‚Äôm a fan of TES before fallout. What I‚Äôm saying is, that without Fallout 3, and without TES, WITHOUT BETHESDA, you would never have your precious New Vegas.

Think about that seriously, and logically before you just jump on Swaims personal preference bandwagon (no offense intended and all hail to the Swaim). Just think about it logically, and how it would be rediculous to call such a close, influential, and integral Predecessor, Garbage. 

Makes you look silly and capricious as fuck. Here Watch, I‚Äôll show you ‚ÄúMetal gear solid was garbage! I‚Äôm all about MGS5!‚Äù. I would Hammer Spank you in the fucking Blood for saying something as illogical as this.

Fink is an artist that wants to create artsy pieces of work, but that takes time. That can‚Äôt be done in a few weeks if you really care about the quality your output.

Hollywood is a business, and Fink wasn‚Äôt in it for the money.

"Loved this game! But I agree the first playthrough was frustrating as wll, but the feeling of beating those god damn wall jump controls was pretty good. Also just was a keystone game for the metroid series - metroid prime (also awesome) was almost a remaster/reboot of super metroid, with the abilities and power-ups being almost identical to super metroid. I highly recommend more recent metroid games to Swaim as they fixed a lot of the issues (poor direction in-game, obscure obstacles, wall-jump) as well as including more story elements. Super metroid was one of those games made to ensure many hours of playtime, though that was a popular tactic when they were made to boast greater playtime.
I am not sure if liking sci-fi was why I love this game, or if the game is why I love the genre.

"A few thoughts:

1. To listen to you three parrot the word problematic over and over to each other gets really nauseating. And then to hear  "" eww he bathed instead of showered"" ...you do realize, that's awful for the environment, so it's kind of hypocritical to expose progress in one area and waste in another. 
2. I can not truly express how salty and sad you guys sound, ragging on Judd's career, knowing that you guys aspire to be film makers, it just sounds catty to repeat over and over how terrible he is for film. Oh no! He let's comedians improve on set, how awful! 
3. As soon as I found out about small beans I subscribed, I loved cracked video, specifically Micheal, Maggie, Cody and Daniel, I absolutely love what Cody is doing with some news. Alas, I can not say the same for most of small beans content. I was into it at first, but I feel like frame rate has become a sloppy circle jerk, this review being the shining example of what I mean. 
4. I would hope that you guys can take this  as more of a tough love comment, because I really do hope you succeed, but I don't think choosing a movie where the entire review is ""it's problematic"" is a recipe for this.
5. To end on a positive note, I think one ups man ship is pretty good, maybe because of the different views the hosts hold.

"Hey there, just thought I'd let you know my thoughts on the Fallout debate.
My first Fallout game was Tactics which I thought was awesome so I went back and played the first two (also great, though the first has not aged so well). When Fallout 3 came out I brought it immediately and have since played it for several thousand hours. I modded it for years (more guns, enemies & locations) and even built my own mod to create new dungeons & combat arenas (unreleased coz it was a mess). When New Vegas was released I was very disappointed. Linear early game, boring interiors (mostly), the Strip was way too small and not enough combat after my modded FO3 plays so I built AWOP (A World Of Pain - a large mod) mainly so I could play New Vegas closer to the game I wanted in the first place. Not that it's a bad game, I still think it's one of the greatest games ever made and certain aspects of New Vegas still shine over it's competitors (quests/dialogue/DLCs/ammo variants and other stuff) and I played it in the end about as much as FO3 but to me it's the Fallout game that let me down the most.
Fallout 4 I thought was great but very difficult to create an AWOP for due to certain technical issues so I'm not modding it heavily like the others. I still put 200-300 hours into it with mostly just the base game and I still really like it, though I don't like certain things, especially the dialogue. Other than that I'm not a fan of the new Power Armour (too clunky, don't like the Fusion Core element or the HUD) and find the game too easy even without it all the time (Glowing Sea included). 
Never drugged Mama Murphy to death, I thought she'd be like a Water Beggar and just keep asking for more so I ignored that option. 
I had no idea you could get a good ending, though I usually avoid completing the game. I'll have to look into that in the future.
In the end Fallout 3 would have to be my top game from the series. I even prefer the AWOP mod for FO3 as it's my later work and everything I learned modding New Vegas helped make the FO3 version more technical, exciting and detailed.

"For me, the big difference between depression and sadness is the idea of reasonability.  Depression doesn't need a justification, or at the very least defies one: I'm incredibly morose and objectively my life is OK. Depression is, for me, defined by its irrationality.  I'm incredibly sad, and there is no specific reason.  However, if I'm just sad, I can point to an emotional reaction to circumstance that makes sense.  Truth be told, even healthy people have disproportionate reactions to stimuli, but what makes a depression episode, event, whatever the fuck you want to call it, unique is it's independence from specific life events.  It's a perceived pattern that only the patient can justify, or an inability to experience joy, even when its reasonable for one to do so.",2,0,2018-08-17T09:02:52.000Z,Jim M,UCbUZ1o9INqnlqXrLe7_qATg,Q8fpwmQdHOc,True,Ugy-BXQR9CntHYtwyI14AaABAg

Great ep! More entertaining than fallout 4! I can't say it without being mean but I feel compelled... My biggest take away from this entire series is the Ganz and I have fundamental disagreements on many many. Too many to list... on every episode the man is mountain of bad takes on games.

"There's a ton of interesting play with names in this film. ""Munt"" is German for ""mouth,"" a perfect symbol for an insurance salesman. ""Madman Munt"" may be an allusion to the ""mouth of the madman,"" an archetypal idea going back to Shakespeare and beyond (think of King Lear) that there is wisdom and truth that comes from the mouth of the lunatic, even as it's mixed with lies and delusions.
""Madman Munt"" is speaking, but Barton doesn't listen.  

Also, the first names for Munt, both ""Charlie"" (an English name) and Karl (a German one) mean ""man.""

"A game that rewards you for being evil: star wars; knights of the old republic 2
Star wars knights of the old republic 2 has a very robust karma system. It rewards you more for being consistent, and does an amazing job of reflecting the nature of the force. When you were good you were a mighty lightsaber warrior, who was tough and able to throw themselves around the battlefield; chose the evil options and you could be the baddest Sith around, choking enemies and using force lightening to wipe out whole groups. Not that you couldn't be an evil lightsaber fighter, or a good mage, but the rewards for being good or evil were weighted the other way around. 
Not only that, but your companions would form radically different relationships with you based on your actions and how you explained those actions to them, as well as how you treated them in general. So much so that you could change their general demeanor and alignment or drive them to turn on you.

"Ok at about 40min in Adam starts talking about the underground railroad and how it's insane to reference it without a more concrete comparison with slavery. And there is actually an in universe reason why that simply isn't true.

You have to take it at face value, the discussion on sentience and the role of AI, is because you have to examine the Railroad through the eyes of the characters. These are people with a rudimentary understanding of history at best. In Fenway park a guy tries to sell you swatters, claiming that baseball was this horrible blood sport. 

The railroad named themselves after a movement that they didn't fully understand. Someone probably read about how the original railroad carried people to freedom, but lacked any sort of contextual background for it. The reason that the railroad doesn't explore their namesakes compexities is because, just like the guy hawking swatters, they are completely ignorant of it. 

They can't possibly know about all the history surrounding the underground railroad. Exploring it further would be illogical. It wouldn't make any narrative sense.

"@ Small Beans
I'm concerned that the vast majority of people who would want to know that Droid Swaim has been reactivated at Small Beans, simply aren't aware of this and have no way of finding out. In my case, I found that Cracked had stopped being funny, or rather that they had started making videos that were factually accurate, but contained no comedic insight. I was about to abandon the site, but then Cody started making the More News bits and that kept me interested. But even then, all I'd heard about the changed at Cracked, was that Jack had left. That was it. We, the general public, didn't have any more information than that. 

It was only by accident that today, while looking through comments on Some More News, someone actually shared some information, and one fellow was nice enough to post this link. Without that accidental finding, I'd have remained blissfully ignorant of Cracked becoming errr... Un-cracked? Anyway, maybe you could ask Cody to shout out to your channel in his next News update. I'm certain that this channel would grow if  people knew of its existence.",0,0,2018-08-02T01:06:50.000Z,Razar Campbell,UCdgTxwLrJ_TX5d7SQYC534w,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgzzwKOWhzufbtzPylN4AaABAg

You made the very valid point that later in the film that when Tom was being beaten over his debts that he said ""no hard feelings"", and the hired goons responded that of course there wouldn't be, this was just business to them, no joy to it, just what they did.

But when Tom hits Frankie with the chair, Frankie looks totally shocked and betrayed by the action. He responds back with a totally (emotionally) injured look and says ""Jesus Tom"" and walks out to the get the other guy to help him.

The other interactions between the Tom and goons of each faction in these moments is like watching Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog, there is no ill will or malice, it's simply business, whereas in this moment Tom clearly acted in a way outside of the understood and expected behaviour.Wondering what you make of that moment and why he might have acted that way.",0,0,2018-07-16T04:00:28.000Z,ozthemalefic,UCx2Ic6-WyHQkN_CHXeIU-yg,w3DdpZsD1g0,True,Ugwy6GMhafY0WIOZfBp4AaABAg

"There are games that take the two parts (story and gameplay) and use them to prop eachother up in every moment. As an example, Spec Ops: The Line makes the theme of the story rely totally on the actions of the player. You are killing enemies that, effectively, are the good guys and it gets increasingly difficult to do so as the game progresses. Then by the end, the game simply asks you to look at yourself and reflect upon your still fresh and stinging memories of bashing your head against a wall of enemies that you almost certainly can't justify. Then it hits you: This is how the most vile evil is able to continue in our world, by justifying every atrocity along the way because... there's no way that I'm not the Hero of this story, right?

Its the dissonance between story and gameplay that inspired me to create a game about raising and selling beef cattle based on AdVenture Capitalist.

"First, thank you and bravo, I love the channel. You are highly entertaining and imformative. This is one of my favorite game series and I was hyped when I saw you posted this video. I won't bother fighting your opinions on the series' story. Agree to disagree. Kojima wrote an epic military/sci-fi soap opera with the bizarre mix of whimsical craziness and intense seriousness that Japanese culture is known for. I believe viewing it that way, as a Japanese soap opera, relieved any issues I had with the story. It's not for everyone, but Kojima built a fabulous new engine so that people that aren't into the story can still enjoy the gameplay.

Second, my biggest problem with this wonderful content module is that neither of you seems to realize that cardboard box traveling exists. You can fast travel b/w any outposts in the area and you can use it on your Mother Base. No neeed to drive or call a chopper. Just dind the fast travel platform, get in a box and choose your destination. A truck picks you up and delivers you, reminiscent of MGS1.
 
Lastly, the pay-to-play system that you and I hate so much was Konami's push, not Hideo. It is a big part of why he left the company and why he didn't actually finish this game. (There was a planned third setting and story arc.)

 Again, love what you guys are doing here.(I'm finally watching Miller's Crossing, literally right now, because of the Coen Brothers Brothers. Love the Coens, just never got around to it. Until now.)

 Seriously, are you guys just not going to do any of the PvP stuff for this either? It was disappointing with The Last of Us and it's just as bad here. Two of the best PvP systems ever and you don't even mention them. Not even in passing.

"Hey guys.

Was well buzzing when I saw this as I have played the shit out of MGS V and enjoyed the whole franchise but one thing struck me with this game is that it's kinda like the Star Wars Prequels in terms of plot - retconning a load of stuff into their New Hope/MGX1 starting positions in a wacky and tonally inconsistent way and not caring about narrative sense is pretty much Revenge of the Sith. Going from mad one liners and comedy robots to murdering younglings and domestic abuse on a lava planet? Going from suplexing a sheep to murdering your own guys as they salute you? The names of the characters? Darth Tyranous/Skullface etc... It's just a mess. Also the dialogue is bad as well... starting to wonder if George Lucas and Hideo Kojima are the same person... Anyway this though occurred to me as I started writing the comment but am actually beginning to think there is a whole thesis here so am gonna stop with that before I end up rambling and uncovering links for the next two days...

I enjoyed the gameplay mechanics and it's a very fun game to play so I agree with you there. Glad you reference your Escort Mission about it (and props for all the Escort Missions btwz) coz that childlike glee at poop crashing cars and sexy boxes seducing active Soviet soldiers on duty is the best thing about it. The fulton system linking to your base management is very good design and the upgrades for weapons needing you to earn GMP and missions being easier if you have certain weapons makes you want to do the side quests so the actual gameplay loop is very strong and addictive. I agree with Adam(ska) on Kojima's visual flair on set pieces being a major strength and the challenges lend the game replay value. So if you take these things all together that sounds like a pretty damn good game and one you would keep... however...

It's the plot innit? It's always the plot and since the MGS series has always been so plot heavy you can't divorce the game from the plot (although Hideo tried his best by replacing the feature film length cut-scenes of 4 with the tapes which you don't have to listen to) and the narrative is where this game falls down. Skullface is a shit villain who you hardly ever see and his greatest contribution to the game is his lust for revenge meme (which is fucking hilarious btw). The jeep ride that you take with him at the end of mission 30 is ridiculous and not really earned and his plan is stupid AF as well with his vocal chord parasites. The fact that you think you're playing as iconic Big Boss and then you're just a mute doppleganger feels like a cheat as well which I think divorces you from the story somewhat. Miller and Ocelot are completely inconsistent with anything we've known about them before (especially Ocelot) and actually vacillate in this game too. The story is partially ruined by the dumb as fuck ending to MGS 4 where the comic relief on the codec in MGS 3 turned out to be the Illuminati so it was hamstrung by that slightly but Kojima's desire to make it all rhyme, it's like poetry (there's Lucas again) mean that even as a fan of this franchise I was just a bit nonplussed by the story. Having said the above the actual execution of the doppleganger thread (The Man Who Sold the World beginning, the muteness of your protagonist, characters not recognising you at first) is really well done and the actual motive for Skullface's plan makes sense from what we learn about him as the game progresses. 

I'll finish (you'll be glad to know) by saying that because of this I'd delete it. If I was gonna keep one MGS it'd be 3 because that seems like the last one he made coz he wanted to rather than because he felt obliged to and the gameplay, knowing story and mix between open world/linear gameplay was probably at its best. 

Cheers for the podcast though guyse coz it clearly got me thinking (maybe a little too much). I'm off to write a 9000 word dissertation on how auteurs always kill the franchises they love or Hideo Lucas: A Metal Star Solid Wars story.

"Frame rate and 1upmanship is hastily becoming the rarest of gems I wait on for weeks !! 

Can I ask something if you guys please? You're my nighty go sleepybyes playlist and my half asleep to work playlist... As such, would be awsome if your playlists on YouTube were updated to reflect the new releases as soon as released. 

Furthermore, have you guys considered an extremely low budget AdWords investment? It allows you to target specific audiences to see adverts for your channel. (For example... anyone watching cracked content could be such an audience) 

Also, for professional purposes, I have been using your guys content as adverts to test settings on. By that all I mean is- I'm granted a dollar a day google AdWords account just to test settings on- so as to do job properly. 

I only mention it as on just that- I've had about 200 clicks and 20,000 impressions in 6 months now.  (Meaning it's advertising fully according to the allowed free budget of a dollar a day)

I would highly advise some very low budget-limited advertising... specifically on YouTube only (a display campaign). 

Just because as a newer channel, the YouTube algorithm rly just won't connect you guys very quickly on the list. You needs to get the small beans name out there... once people have clicked on your stuff in a chain with other similar content creators- the algorithm will understand you are connected to the nerd/gamer/artist end of the market. 

 

By all means ignore me guys- just rly rly wants you peeps to hit it big is all :)",0,0,2018-07-09T01:03:33.000Z,irishprice,UCVOoCJTryXVkhBu4aAAeYxQ,jGdPq6RwoMI,True,UgzVWlpOlX3a1EXvsGJ4AaABAg

"I had a strange dream, once upon a flu. It was a movie remake fever dream of the sort that I have when I sleep at unusual hours... as one does.

In the dream I watched a recast Beetlejuice, same story, same plot, new actors. Corey Feldman was the uh, title character. That alone was enough to get my rankles agitated. The Maitlands were swapped for a more uh ethnically diverse couple (which further exacerbated things... I mean the POINT of the Maitlands were that they were PAINFULLY boring/dorky, even if they were the audience inserts.) Ricky Gervais played Otho, so I mean it wasn't a COMPLETE trainwreck. Also, Emily Blunt played a fantastic and practically show-stealing Delia. Millie Bobby-Brown was a bit too subtle as Lydia in the dream though. Gwendoline Christie was in the movie a LOT though I am not particularly sure who she was playing, or if there's some subconscious thing going on there.  That said, Beetlejuice is a f'in CLASSIC and should never EVER be remade.

Y'all are truly funny people, you're creative and you have a knack for tapping right into the audiences brain. Try maybe going the worker cooperative route with your new venture, to insure that the creative folks always have a say in the direction things go-- those are the people we the viewer come to see, not the fucking money-hoarding CEOs.

Hey so there's a game called Orwell Where you must sleuth facebook profiles, news articles company websites,private conversations etc. to make profiles of citizens based on terrorist attacks by a radical group called Thought, so that they might be policed.

Also, I'm with Mike on the Norse v Greek mythology thing. Sort of.

"Oof that last blip at the end about Souls games hurt. I don't think of those games as a feather in the cap, but I do enjoy overcoming a challenge... in the same way you two describe the puzzles as not puzzles because there is only the bare minimum of problem solving involved... I don't consider most triple A releases a game that requires amy effort from me other than mashing a button until the game is over. Dark Souls asks me to pay attention and to learn how to beat it and I find that to be engaging. Similarly I think this God of War presented enough of a challenge (at least one above normal difficulty) to make me figure out how I needed to handle fights. The decision to delete seems rough, but maybe right. I think this game will be important for the industry in terms of revitalizing single player experiences, but I do hope to get and even better example going forward.",1,0,2018-07-01T00:41:44.000Z,NotedNuance,UCKxhZ5sR-tL2TlXhNojLhug,tyhMQty2S9Q,True,Ugy5GO9tbqVtgS-jNsF4AaABAg

"But you can always tell yourself that you look better and if only people saw more of you, you would be covering that Webby with a Kid's Choice Award or a BET Award, or maybe even a Grammy, and you would be able to surround that poster with your face on the blown up cover of Men's Fitness and Time Magazine. Finally, you could tie up his stupid cat that never accepts cuddles from you despite how many treats it gets by tying it up on a rail road track while you twist your mustache because your Roommate will Rue the day he dared to make you look inferior!

Everyone knows he was only Nominated for a Webby to get under your skin anyways, and he covers it up not for your ego sake, but because he doesn't even care. Also his stupid poster, the guy only became a film maker because he knew it would take all the attention away from you. All of this is justified and if your mom would ever get off the couch rather than getting covered in dirty laundry from being hung over from the night before, drunkly folding clothes after your roommate laughs at you by using his big old Patreon money to pay your mom as a maid during your family's hard times (Just another reason to spit on you by the way), she would agree with you 100%. And you know what? The fact that he has a Webby, and isn't even using it for its original intended purpose, as a basket for dildos, only goes to prove how much he is rubbing his success in your face!

You are justified in all of this revenge as this douchebag roommate does everything to trample on your ego from covering you on the rent sometimes, like when that play you wrote went under because suddenly now is not the time to write a play about how Hitler was a tragic hero forced to do ""evil"" by the Italians, Japanese, and even more secret, the Mexicans who were looking to use extreme genocide against immigrants as a diversion in their plan to jump to boarder and take over American cultural society by making cilantro and avocado hip, and steal all the good old fashioned American jobs... like cotton picking, or that time you just didn't feel like paying rent. You are also justified in how he also gave you that really awesome camera for Christmas, suggesting that now ""you can make your own Youtube as well"" damn well knowing you don't have the editing software to compete with his content or a Green screen or boom mic! The guy is not even really a christian, he's just pretending to be polite just because YOU celebrate it! That bastard! He even said your play might be ""offensive"", when you were bouncing ideas off of him because you know, the dude can never just be supportive as a friend...

No, you are TOTALLY Justified, but unfortunately for you, you are too nice a guy, too good a roommate,. and too polite to do any of that stuff. So when you take a dump on his pillow tonight, and cover it up with a few spoon-fulls of cat liter to redirect him to his jerk cat as the culprit, he can appreciate that you just took the calm and rational nice guy approach, because unlike him, you don't rub how better looking and potentially talented you are in his face.And you know what? He probably won't appreciate it, but you know that is the path all good roommates must fallow.

"I never thought about the character of Leonard Smalls from your perspective I had just assumed that he was an actual evil entity or spirit that HI had conjured with the act of stealing Nathan Jr. (A  fundamentally ""good"" man committing an ""evil"" deed in this case kidnapping).

 I had always assumed the matching tattoos were to validate to both HI and the audience that Smalls was in fact a demon of  HI's own making. That along with some of his other magical elements like the burning flower, the riding of the motorcycle straight up the ladder, the flames shooting out of his hand after being shot by HI, and (my personal favorite) his blink and you'll miss it apparent ability to will both a cigar and match into his hands out of seemingly thin air while walking back to the Unpainted Arizona corporate offices

 Smalls also indicates in his conversation with Nathan Sr. That he himself had been sold on the black market as an infant. This led me to believe that the bronze baby shoes had in fact belonged to Smalls presumably bronzed by whoever purchased him as an infant and kept by him as a reminder of his own tragic past. Also after Smalls is blown up by his own grenade you see various debris hitting the ground including the flaming motorcycle boot of the grown Leonard Smalls but as the baby boots hit the ground if you listen carefully you can hear the distant sound of a baby crying. I never knew quite what to make of that, I thought it was possibly the last uncorrupted part of Leonard Smalls' soul.

So I do agree that he at least had been a real person at one time... what he was by the time he interacts with the characters in the movie I'd say is pretty much anyone's guess.",0,0,2018-06-27T05:00:54.000Z,Andrew Snyder,UC2iEQdq-rbOc6e2fiE6-CvQ,1NQTeojAl8o,True,UgwJkk5ll1NWZhYHz4V4AaABAg

"A friend of mine in high school was the son of a Manhattan Project physicist. He told me a story his father had told him once. A bunch of these nobel lauriets and fathers of nulcear physics were sitting around one day getting drunk. They decided to prove, once and for all, that the light in the fridge actually does turn off when you close the door. So they took everything out of a fridge and one of the physicists climbed inside (I wish I knew who) and they shut the door.

Later on, I went to Cornell and many of my friends were physics majors (I started out as one too, but I couldn't handle the math).

"So, like, holy shit I love that you're talking about how Sailor Moon carried you through those years. As a skinny, effeminate guy it was just so formative and exactly the sort of thing I needed to see at that time in my life and, I think, a large part of why the alienation I felt from society in my 20's never took root as the kind of incredibly hostile... I'll say imitations of masculinity you see from the kind of socially awkward guys who are now MRA's or whatever.

It was just, I don't know, amazingly reassuring to see something that wasn't afraid of emotional content and wasn't afraid to explore the ways in which people can be both good and bad, without having to exclusively be one or the other. It was just so instructive in not internalizing my resentments towards the world around me.

I'm trying really hard not to cry right now, it's not working very well.

So, let me talk about some more technical stuff because I'm such a fanboy.

My understanding was that Sailor Moon couldn't go past about halfway through Sailor Moon R, during it's original run, wasn't because of a restriction on the number of episodes but because what we were watching was on broadcast television in time slots that target younger audiences. So, when Sailor Neptune and Uranus are introduced in the second half and have a, let's say, nebulously defined intimacy it made the suits nervous. This was like 1995, remember.

Anyway, that might be apocryphal, but that's the explanation I've always bought into.

The other thing about that is... you, Starline, watched a completely different show than those who saw it on Carton Network. They produced an entirely different dub with a different voice cast and, holy shit, if you watch it it's really bizarre to behold. As much of a spaz I am for Sailor Moon, I can't even watch the Viz dubbed version and have really never seen much past where the original dub ended.

The original dub was done by DiC and, there is a healthy dose of personal preference and me just being used to a thing and nostalgia and whatever in here, for me it's just way better. The viz dub just felt flavorless and like the voice actors were just cashing a paycheck, where the original took a lot of liberties in order to sell it to a younger, American audience that just resulted in a very unique kind of magic.

I've actually tried to watch the Viz dub from the beginning and, literally, it's so different it's unrecognizable to me. I constantly feel like I'm missing something or I'm watching the episodes out of order. It's the most weirdly surreal thing.

So, sorry for writing a poorly focused essay.

Thanks so much for giving me the rare occasion to geek out on it.

I'm only 9 minutes in so... I'll probably have more to say. <.<",2,1,2018-05-31T05:50:08.000Z,Lilith Euphimia,UC-X0N4Qg01OJR-CUhSRL0Mg,m3PRgtC1mpo,True,UgzVCs9nU5VD3lHWg494AaABAg

I feel  I'm truly a fly on the wall.. hopefully I'm not buzzing in your ear üòä,0,0,2018-05-27T16:43:54.000Z,ry wyche,UCHhDpQogufEBCykeDEg9frA,m3PRgtC1mpo,True,UgxRwcT-J2pIBp180V94AaABAg

"I am seven minutes in, and already arguing against you out loud. 
Daniel O'Brien, you are one of my favorite comedians alive today. It's literally Louis C.K. and then you (you moved up to #1 and #2 respectively when George Carlin died). And, frankly, ""I don't like youtube's algorithm"" is a shitty reason not to continue doing and being that. 
Start your own site. We will follow you there. 
Please, please try to revive After Hours. It's literally my favorite thing ever. I've seen every episode at least twice. Most of them more times than that. I've seen ""Which Ninja Turtle are You?"" a number of times equal to the amount of people that I have been able to force to watch it with me, which is actually a fairly significant figure. 
Swaim, I didn't forget you. You are an amazing comedian, and certainly on my list (though, honestly, I haven't really decided on any real order beyond Louis and Dan. The only thing I can really say with certainty is that I like you more than Bo Burnham lol). But, c'mon. I bet you would agree that Dan is great at this. lmao

Of course, I understand that I have no right to force you to keep making the things that I enjoy. And, I do understand your point about youtube's algorithm. It sucks, creating art under any kind of constraints. It's easy to start to wonder if it's even art at that point. But, the part of me that is an entitled dick really badly wants to accuse you of just being greedy, even though you do have to, like, eat and stuff, just like the rest of us. 
If there's one thing I'd like you to take away from this comment it's this: this has been hard on all of us. I know it doesn't effect my life in the very real and significant way that it effects yours, but... Watching the end of literally my favorite website, and hearing the defeat in the voices of some of my favorite people, it's hard. And no one knows what to do with that. So, while of course, your fans could stand to have a little perspective, just try to keep in mind that when we're making unreasonable demands and tearing apart your decisions, it's because we care, and we don't know what to do with the crazy emotions over this whole thing. 
Please bring back After Hours. lmao",0,0,2018-05-26T06:31:07.000Z,Bronson Carder,UC7EoDF0vwU0MXISMt9ricfw,z80bqIcJQZo,True,UgxvCw-udV9ogOcuvUp4AaABAg

"a theory: if we can differentiate existentialism from depression, and define existentialism as removing yourself on some level (because it isn't strictly 'intellectual') from your existence... your left with certain things that don't remove that you're left to contend with... i think one of those things is abandonment which i don't think is capable of feeling removed from and so, because we're culturally prone to glorifying having simplification/context, like existence we become capable of experiencing abandonment without feeling abandoned, similar as with depression we can brace for a feeling while understanding the feeling isn't a rational way of seeing or reacting to our environment...
that abandonment shit i think fucks with people because it's like a grip that doesn't hold and when you feel abandonment it feels like you've been abandoned and so you want to be rational and find a target of whose abandoned you, when, like depression, there isn't something making you feel that way, except your own existential self-hacking, which is important because it's building these facets of character... but it's very proceed at your own risk, a literal risk of ownership that i don't think there's much any higher calling than and why people default to god as curator of all these sorts of would-be abstractions... when really that only cottons if you give up a lot of self-access... they both carry risk, especially if you look at heaven as a carrot-on-a-stick and not a sundae at the end of the week",0,0,2018-05-15T12:31:26.000Z,Bryan McCormick,UCJArr_p1cNVFtXp7_k43kjg,TZ9AK2Q-I0c,True,Ugx-vnG0h8f40TDoNYx4AaABAg

"I do believe George Lucas was forced to sell Lucasfilm.¬†

Hense the reason George Lucas called Disney white slavers.

George Lucas later retracted his statement about Disney.

http://variety.com/2015/film/news/george-lucas-rolls-back-complaints-that-star-wars-successors-are-white-slavers-1201670406/amp/


Here is a possible conversation between Disney and George Lucas.¬†


*George Lucas* ¬†: You guys wanted to see me.

Wait till you see some more of my ideas for the new trilogy. It's going to be fantastic!


*Disney* ¬†: Yes, George there's some things we need to discuss. Please take a seat....

We regret to inform you that we're not interested in further pursuing a new trilogy with you involved.


*George Lucas* : ¬†I don't understand. I mean I have some great ideas and material here for the new trilogy.¬†


*Disney* ¬†: Well George we're taking Star Wars in a new direction and frankly you're just getting in the way.


*George Lucas* ¬†: Hold on a second here, Star Wars is mine. I made this franchise.


*Disney* ¬†: We're well aware of that George but you see we no longer need you. Let's be honest here George. You were never a great director and the prequels were terrible.

With all the ideas you've provided about the Star Wars mythology we can make films for years to come.¬†

What we need is Lucasfilm.¬†


*George Lucas* ¬†: Let's get one thing straight here, I'm not selling Lucasfilm!

I built Lucasfilm from the ground up!

You guys are free to use my ideas, but I don't want Star Wars going in a new direction.

We can collaborate. That's fine. Just don't destroy what I created.


*Disney* ¬†: What you want is irrelevant at this point George. Our investors want you out of the way. We have plans for Star Wars.

You are going to sell us Lucasfilm.¬†


*George Lucas* ¬†: And why would I do that?!

You can't make me sell anything!¬†


*Disney* : George, don't be so defiant about this. It would be a shame if the public knew about that night at the hotel.


*George Lucas* : I don't know what you're talking about. What hotel?


*Disney* : George come on now. You know you can't hide secrets within this industry.

You know what hotel we're talking about.

Underage girls and you in a drunken stupar.

After all we made sure you had plenty of company that night.¬†


*George Lucas* ¬†: Oh my God. They were underage? We were just having a good time.

I didn't know I swear!

Anyway you can't prove anything!


*Disney* : ¬†Well George we have many witnesses and the entire night was video taped. As a matter of fact this isn't the only video tape we have of you.

We also know about your secret dealings with the pornographic film industry making spoofs of Star Wars.¬†


*George Lucas* ¬†: How do you guys know about that?¬†


*Disney* : ¬†Doesn't really matter George.

What matters is what we're willing to do with the information we have.


*George Lucas* ¬†: ¬†Oh God, you wouldn't!¬†

My family. My friends and reputation.¬†

My life's work in this film industry.¬†

I've been friends with many of you guys for years.

Please you can't.¬†


*Disney* : ¬†This is business George.¬†

We always liked you, but we need Lucasfilm.

Since we like you so much we're going to make you an offer.¬†

Sell us Lucasfilm and all the information we have on you remains unknown to the public.

You will agree to have nothing else to do with Star Wars.¬†


*George Lucas* ¬†: Please, you can't make me do this. Lucasfilm and Star Wars is my life's work. No, I can't.¬†


*Disney* ¬†: George this is a one time offer.

Don't make this difficult. If you won't sell Lucasfilm we will find another means of acquiring your company anyway.

Take the deal George. This is our final offer.

Take the money and give us what we want.


*George Lucas* ¬†: You all are evil! This is unbelievable!


*Disney* ¬†: You had no qualms when our friends helped you build your film legacy.

Star Wars and Indiana Jones.

Surely you didn't think all of the doors that opened for you was all your doing.

Now it's time to return the favor George.¬†


*George Lucas* ¬†: I can't believe I was being used all these years. I never imagined it would end this way.¬†

Either way you all win...

I will sell you Lucasfilm, but I'll have you know that what has been done to me is despicable!


*Disney* ¬†: We're sorry you feel this way George. Our investors have big plans for Lucasfilm.

Now we have some formalities to get through here and then all we need is your signature on these documents to begin the sale process.¬†

You're doing the right thing George.",0,0,2018-05-13T23:58:20.000Z,David Smith,UCwbpdRvZ-xAWTgvCzWKo6eg,1ASWLshamUM,True,UgwhNaMXsucse5EfSNx4AaABAg

"The antimater fuel is the best option. It is a VERY long way from functioning. We can now keep antimatter stable. Cern has an antihydrogen factory where they create and store it. But they only can make a few atoms at a time. We need many many pounds of the stuff for this to work, which is much harder not only to create, but to contain.

But using that you can accellerate at 9.8 m/s^2 for a few years, simulating gravity. Then flip the ship around and decellerate at the same rate, so you are actually weightless for a very short time. The actual travel time is hard to calculate because you need to use general relativity to do it. But the total travel time would not be unreasonable.

For a solar sail, it is very slow acceleration. It is good for light weight long distance travel where eventually the speed increases. It would not have much impact for a ship big enough to carry people. You could use laser acceleration to boost the antimatter, but it would only help so much. Once you get too far, the lasers are less helpful.",0,0,2018-05-11T01:52:44.000Z,Sam,UCSSiNBETegM05vhqqu3mQSg,NBF1J3pdEb0,True,UgywpWQDZ63TUyY2Xs14AaABAg

I think the wait calculation comes up in the first Ender's Game with the human fleet that's sent out.

"Why send people who are already born, what if we(not me or you but somebody) were to store genetic information ""somehow""(I know I know a dirty word) and then ""somehow""(there's that word again) initialize it when the ""ship"" lands on whatever planet.

 Like have the bacteria and fungus and algi get releasd first to turn the planet into something that will suport basic plant life, then let the grass out, and so on and so forth.

It would remove the whole ""a single human lifetime"" thing, which I think we can all admit is the real limiting factor here.

I don't know how we'll preserve our culture though and I doubt a copy of hooked on phonics will cut it.
Do you think new born humans on an alien world will like video games or will they be too busy hunter gathering to have time for that.

Granted it would take eons for the whole traveling and seeding process to happen in full, and with that kind of a timeline there will alway be the chance that something could go wrong, but obvi who ever creats this wont stop at one, and since it wouldn't have living people in it would be more like an abortion or dried jizz if the whole thing does go tits up, as opposed to having a sentient crew die tragically light years away from home.

In summation I believe that rather than sending us(again not you and me but someone) really really(ten more reallys) really fast. instead of doing that, we should build a planet seeding machine(Prolly building it in outerspace like you said with your thing) and send it just really really really fast (instead of really^13 fast) and have it take its time do its thing.

I am acutely aware that they are my own inner voice, and that I am my worst critic, but they still feel beyond controlling or a deserved punishment. Annoying how you can hate yourself to a point where that you think you don't deserve help, but upon recovering feel like help isn't necessary and a waste of professionals' time. Also dreamed of becoming a writer or cartoonist growing up but ultimately felt futility in pursuing them.

"One important things that was not covered is the fact that this game is the poster child of the Truman Show games. That is, games where the world, and people in it, seem to only exist for one purpose and one purpose only: to react, and interact with the player. Nothing ever feels like it existed before you walked into the room/city/dungeon. And everything is perfectly designed for a player to walk around, but is always so impractical if you think about it as a living, breathing world.

So, the dwemer; They had wars with the Dunmer (dark Elves), their last war was due to accusations of (the Dwemer) practicing heathen/heretical ''science'' that insulted the Dunmer gods. Namely, the Dwemer chief ''scientist'' Kagronac ( the Albert Einstein of the Dwarves) trying to access the power of godhood, via the heart of a god (Lorkhan, who created the world and was torn to pieces for the deed). During the great battle between the Dwemer and Dunmer, and their hero kings, Dumac (dwarves) and Neravar (Dumner), also former friends, Kagronac attempted to use the heart, indoing so, all Dwemer, everywhere, disappeared.

"Regarding the topic of ""financial incentive in game making"", I think Michael's view should lead the industry (being that a game is made if it is a ""good idea"" that won't exceed the budget allotted).
But sadly that is far from the case. Today's triple A video game companies have a very clear model of ""There is a shit-ton of money to be made if we can hit a high enough percent of gamers in X demographic. Get the research team in here, crunch the numbers on 'most profitable audience' and cross those findings with most profitable tropes - great, now make this game which is Match3-roguelike-zombie-storybased-mmorpg targeted at young mobile gamers - we really want to hit the billions jackpot, so spend as much as you need"". And that's how you get today's triple A bullshitfest. I would say it's the same with movies, but the difficulty of fabricating a script for film prevents it from being standard practice. A video game, on the other hand, could do just fine with a script that took less than a week to write... sadly, I should add.
The only other variation on Videos Games that get made, would be when one of the monolith corporations decides to bust out some ""technical porn"" with a new engine.

"The breadth of skyrim is amazing but nothing really has any impact outside of its own tiny context. Sure you can become archmage but if you go back to white run the alchemest will still say 'If you're interested in magic you should visit the college in winterhold.' It's like bruh you said that last week when I first started learning magic.   Thanks for the tip though, as you can see I'm wearing the archmage's cloak now. You really should have been there. I killed this traitorous usurper then ressurected his corpse and chased him around the main hall while beating him with a mace. Everyone was cheering and made me archmage. It was pretty awesome.

Now, one thing that I kind of dislike is how you can pretty much become the most important person in each town and that doesn`t change your reputation whatsoever in the other parts of the world. Like, I feel like if you just helped resolve the civil war, people should take notice of you. Also, some questlines should have a certain prerequisites to complete: how can I become the archmage of the college of magic when I am playing a brute that only knows how to do the most basic spells?

"Skyrim is simple. And that can be fun. You have a sword, you swing it, you hit. You have a spell, you charge it, you cast. You join a guild, you do missions, you're the main guy now. Yay.

It wasn't as simple in Morrowind. Your sword had a miss chance. Your spell had a fail chance. Your thieving skills were useless if their level wasn't high enough (extremely annoying. Thieving is just fun in Skyrim, gotta admit that). And factions were much more complex. The Great Houses were competing with each other. Guilds were conflicted internally and externally. Breezing through a Guild's missions might've meant you were unable to ever join a different Guild - and if you already did, you'd be expelled if you go through with the mission. You had to navigate the internal politics of the Guilds to get everything, because they were all part of the same world. In Skyrim, other than the rebellion and the Vampires/Dawnguard in the DLC, they're just a bunch of people that give you jobs and don't care at all about anyone else. Which is perfectly fine, if that's what you want. I feel like Morrowind would scare a lot of people off now, even though the world seems a bit more interesting, being full of giant mushrooms, ash wastelands, weird plants and animals, as opposed to Skyrim's ""medieval northern land"" feel, because it seems to be a lot closer to the old ""you have an A4 sheet of stats here"" RPGs as opposed to the more recent ""it's basically an FPS with stats"" RPGs. But if you focus not on the fighting/magic/thieving mechanics, but on the story arcs and the world, it's difficult to argue that Skyrim is better than Morrowind, because, at those particular things, it simply isn't.",1,0,2018-04-25T06:47:44.000Z,Kxevineth,UCsKhOYJJEAyEvW-e0nJZkfw,L4uHPqh44z0,True,UgytOTCdbzbji0ZQgC54AaABAg

"Man, where to start....George Lucas is such a <choose your own derogotory word>, but he did donate all the earnings from Disney to charity, so that puts me in a quandry about the man. And screwing up the Star Wars (tm) franchise? Damn, they did it! This last movie they put out pretty much turned off all the 30+ year olds who would spend 70% of their income on merchandise to maybe never going to see another Disney Star Wars anything. 
Any company who can make Jar Jar look like a deep and complex character when compared to their most current offerings deserve what they get: a Han Solo movie where the movie trailers show the lead actor can't act and might more despised more than the Ghostbusters remake.

"God it's great to hear you guys ago... but I found something absolutely terrifying reading between the lines: an issue often highlighted (ironically by both of you) in cracked about the current socioeconomic climate affecting millennials and the backlash which we are going through. Two possible almost iconic internet personalities, having to face the real life consequences of moving back home with their parents.

I know this story almost intimately: recovered alcoholic, surviving (barely) from rampant bipolar disorder, have a PhD in chemistry, yet living at home with my parents as I'm practically unemployable. Hearing this placed a heavy lead bar in my chest as it resounded so heavily within the context of my own narrative.

"The first and only time I‚Äôve watched this was when I was sleeping over at my grandparents‚Äô house and I was meaning to just watch some tv to get sleepy.

I ended up watching the whole thing to the very end. I was pretty young and it just stuck with me. It also turned me on to Aimee Mann.

What really sucked at the time though was that in my country the internet was not yet a thing (dial up was ONLY getting started) so I had to keep this whole movie and the music in my mind and rewatch it there so much so that when I was finally able to listen to the music again years later, the music in my mind was completely different from the actual music.

No one else I knew had watched it either so I had no one to talk to about it.

I haven‚Äôt rewatched the movie yet because I‚Äôve been afraid that I‚Äôd built it up in my mind and the actual thing might let me down on a rewatch but I think I‚Äôll finally sit down and watch it again.

Great episode guys, keep em coming. :)",1,0,2018-04-17T04:18:11.000Z,LiquorChuggingKnight,UCURXb6cQpOFYmu3NZQ2lDMg,jGdPq6RwoMI,True,UgyiMt5W98MBTjnlpzJ4AaABAg

"I see the Lutece twins as being the real villains of Bioshock Infinite. Also, they only cooked up this plan after Comstock tried to kill them.

Also the racist view that Booker has are more subtle. He often remarks that the class segregation is how things are and will always be whenever Elizabeth asks about it. It is more that is attitude of ""this is how it is and it is not for me to do anything about it"" that is the racism. ""Inaction is the weapon of mass destruction"" as Faithless put it.

Whilst it is easy to put ourselves into the shoes of Booker and say ""well I did not throw the baseball therefore my Booker is not racist"" you also did nothing to intervene during the game to evening thing between the races either -- the game never game you chance to do so.

"I'm so glad to see you guys creating again. Missed y'all for reals.  I'm actually stoked to see how y'all develop and improve now that you're going independent and are out from under the thumb of the Cracked editorial format and office culture. Not that i have any insight into what it was like working at Cracked. I'm sure there was a lot of fun to be had, and enough freedom to keep creatively stimulated. Even so Im sure theres some amount of self-editing and self-limiting that occurs, either consciously or not, in the creative process, in order to reinforce the brand identity or otherwise hold the work to some other standard that isn't necessarily based on the merits of the work as a craft or art form, but by its ultimate value and utility to the company as a marketable commodity.  The two arent mutually exclusive, of course. at least not all the time. but they aren't generally found working in perfect step either.
Anyways keep it up y'all. Can't wait to see/hear more.

"Dammit guys, here I was waiting for the next 1-upsmanship and playing The Last Of Us to kill some time, and you guys go and do it for the show.

At any rate, I want to counterpoint a few of your arguments. 

On the subject of interactivity, this game is not interactive for the story that the game is telling. The game starts in Texas, jumps 20 years into the future and lands you in Boston. You then walk to Lincoln, drive to Pittsburgh, and then travel all the way across the United States to Montana, Colorado, and Utah over months and months.

My point is that in terms of combat encounters, you really only hike from Boston to Lincoln, get through the ambush at Pittsburgh, meet up in Montana and ride to the University, and then end up in Utah. The actual game is showing off the day to day Joel and Ellie have to face. Then it skips 90% of their journey. This isn't some road trip car ride where everything is fine for the towns and cities they pass through on the way. Most places are going to be like Pittsburgh, where bandits hunt down travelers. Not to mention any wild animals or Infected they come across.

I'll compare the story's scale to Skyrim and Far Cry 4. Skyrim takes place over the province of... well... Skyrim, a landmass that is around 140 square miles in lore (ingame it's at 1/10 scale) Massachusetts, which is where Far Cry 4 takes place, is nearly 10 times the size of in lore Skyrim. Granted the scale isn't the most important thing, but the sheer amount of content in those games compared to the area of the map on display is leagues below The Last of Us, as the locations are much closer to actual size... That is, there's a lot more empty space in a lot of other games. 

The Last of Us feels really full of content despite what little of the journey they actually show us because of that really high content density. Cutting more of that content would maybe keep the flow up, but it would do a massive disservice to the sense of going on a long journey, which makes up a lot of the game's story. Yes they could've set the bar lower when it comes to the scale of the story they are telling, but it would also lose that sense of surviving the world if you're just traveling across town. 

This is why Left Behind seems so appealing. The game isn't focusing on the world that the characters live in at all. It's just a small story taking place within a single district of a city. There was no real travel, no focus on worldbuilding, and the scale was smaller so they didn't cut anything out.

In more detail for what the game actually has you play through, you deal with the military quarantine, a mostly abandoned town full of traps, bandits (+worldbuilding: the sewers), then a friendly settlement, cannibals, some more worldbuilding stuff, and the resolution. They really only show each part of the world that Ellie and Joel live in once. When it comes to the mechanics of the game, that is entirely dependant on preference, but in terms of how much they show of the story, cutting more of the interactivity and content would just harm our understanding of the world. Without the amount of worldbuilding that the game provides, without learning the full context of the world Joel and Ellie live in, the interpersonal moments between Joel and Ellie lose some of their meaning.

On the topic of the sonar function Joel has, I don't really see them doing this another way. There has to be a way for hearing and visually impaired people to play the game, hence why they show clear outlines of targets when said target makes noise. Yeah they could've just had the option in the settings or something, but there is also the option of just not using it if you don't like it. The game does quite a good job of audibly signposting enemies if you listen carefully with a good set of surround sound headphones. The exception to the rule is the tier 2 Infected, which are designed ti be ambushers and don't make much sound at all (and thusly don't show up often on your sonar). 

If your next argument for this point is that they could've rebalanced the game so you aren't pushed to use the sonar, my response is that that would harm the sense of world that you gain. Keep in mind that the population of these places is numbering in the hundreds of thousands. You MAYBE fight 300 enemies through the course of the game. 

The one thing I personally think they could've left out some of was the environmental puzzles. Making Ellie able to swim, for example. I think specifically the swimming puzzles are there to have the player develop a daughterly attachment to Ellie, since she is very rarely, if ever helpless in the game, but I think that could've been done with more of those contextual conversations that show up throughout the game and less of the puzzles.

In terms of the story, I mostly agree with you guys. In terms of the ending, I disagree with Joel's choice, but I understand why he made it and don't hold it against him at all. When I played through the game for the first time, I was in a broody, pubescent depression that allowed me to connect with Joel on an emotional level.

When it comes to the ending, I agree that it would absolutely detract from the game if you got to decide for Joel... Because this isn't about you. This is Joel's decision to make, and it fits with his character as portrayed throughout the game. The reason this lack of interaction is okay compared to losing interaction in other places is that this is the end of the game. We fully understand Joel's position, his history, and the context in which he lives. At this point, even offering the option of the other decision would completely derail the story of Joel and Ellie. I don't think Joel is a pathetic character for making this decision, because anyone in his position would've made the same choice.

Like you guys said, making this into a movie would result in a worse movie than it is a game.

On the subject of the second game, I think it would be good as an interquel. Taking place while they travel to Montana. A smaller, more intimate series of setpieces that go further into detail about the world. Of course, new characters and a new story would be better, but if Joel and Ellie have to be featured, it should be an interquel of their travel, or they should be minor chracters that you come across a la Henry and Sam.

"I kind of figured Booker isn't necessarily a racist in the timeline where he doesn't become Comstock.

"I wonder about the future of visual entertainment, aka ""movies"". See, the thing is that when TV came around (heck, the first silent films), it wasn't really that much of a stretch to convey to the uninformed what it was that they were about to experience. You could just say, ""Well, it's basically like being able to watch a play from the best seat in the house"". And in the case of TV, ""Right in your own home."" So,  what we've been doing for the last hundred years or so, technical leap though it was, people have still just been doing what they've already been doing for thousands of years. Just sat and stared at something in a static location. Now, we have this tech that will allow the audience to suddenly look all around them. It's going to be interesting to watch how new artists figure out how to implement that. We kind of got a glimpse of it when 3D movies first started coming out. There had to be a bunch of these scenes where things were poking you in the face or lurching right at you. So, with an aspect ratio not being an issue and a full 3D 360 degree view available to the creators, it will be interesting to see how things will develop. My guess? Hollywood is going to fail miserably at making it popular. It will be a slow process and somewhere out of left field somebody is going to make _something_ (I'm not even sure if there is a word for what it will be, because we don't _have_ it right now) that is going to take the public by surprise and make _everyone_ want to experience it. I'm talking something like how Facebook came into being. People will try and fail and some one or some company is going to bring it home like it was in front of us the whole time. So, like I say, it will be interesting to watch it happen. I hope I live long enough to see some of the cool stuff. ;)",0,0,2018-03-26T08:55:59.000Z,CybershamanX,UC3QwlVjLhY81UTKeaEmSLFg,Ufb8BjMejLs,True,Ugy9HxL35SB25-GYt9V4AaABAg
"(41:00) Extra Credits just did a video about how sci-fi started delving into what were typically occult subjects, because...well, why not! ;) So, excellent observation/point there, Mr. Swaim! :)
(Here's the vid in case anybody is interested: https://youtu.be/v9aIP-Z8Pko) :)

BTW, great show, guys! I'm really enjoying the show and it's great to hear your voices again, to boot! So glad I caught wind of your channel! :D Truth be told, I got pretty depressed there for a while after (cue sound of wolves howling in the distance) ""the thing that shall not be spoken"". I already know what Cody's up to, but if you can throw a hint to where to find what others from ye ol' crew are up to (if they are up to anything), that would be super cool. :) Thanks for all of your hard work and keep on truckin'! :P

"This was beautiful inspirational! I am an ex coke addict, and other than my weight loss which wasn't actually bad, I just lost all of my chubbiness, there were no outward signs I was an addict. I functioned for years like this, with the only times I was ever suspected was when I DIDN'T have my vice because that was when I would act strange and become someone different. I got off powder the hard way, I got thrown in jail for having it on me while being stopped for driving erratically, no rehab, no family and friends for support, no freedom to do anything to aid myself, just cold concrete, metal bars, and unforgiving guards and staff. Luckily I had a decent enough cellmate who helped me the best he could with what he had. I also smoke copious amounts of pot too and try to do what Katy does and only smoke at night because it does sometimes worsen depression if done midday out of boredom but is just about the only thing that really counters my insomnia in the evening.

"As a boy up until the 11th grade, I didn't care for clothes. I wasn't a nudist, I just didn't care what I was wearing. At all. My parents were cool about it, except for one time when I was wearing what could only be described as ""neon green tights"". They weren't tights, They were actually ""my little sisters stretchy green pants""...
I think somewhere along the line it became kind of a point that I was making; like a conscious decision to ""not care"" (which is literally caring)...
I also had the longest-most-untreated hair around the school.
I don't really recall the time frame, but for years the entire school had a head lice epidemic.
It was never said to my face, but I was blamed for it - across all age groups.
And the worst thing was, I couldn't really blame them. Even at the time I thought ""Yeah well... I do look the part"" problem was - I didn't care.
And my few friends didn't either. Those who saw through the weird and the hair have stuck with me to this day ('those' being friends, not lice).


... This would have been such a classic note to end on, but I should also admit that i caught some girl talking major shit about me (+she mentioned her suspect for the 'lice patient 0').
So I got upset, and told 4 people that I overheard her confessing to getting lice as a result of giving oral sex to a homeless man with crabs. And when she came to school with shorter hair the next day (the mark of the cursed), it gave my roumor the tiniest speck of credabillity - which is all you need for it become cold hard fact in middle school.
So it became a thing, and then it died down... In retrospect, most things I did at that time were not cool.
But I think the wierdo, fantastic, make-believe, borderline Asperger's, attention deficited auto-story-teller is still my favorite kind of human operating system, so if any of you ever get to restart + choose what kind of person you get to be, this one comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",2,1,2018-03-12T08:33:34.000Z,PandiiMan,UCTQOWq08NFOccNXp3yomysQ,ja8m5oq6Vsc,True,UgzJji_4hXQVryBBcwt4AaABAg

"Really enjoying this channel and big fan of you guys. (Add 'That being said, I do have a few notes' cliche here) I understand your being on one side of the 'content market' would bias your views, but your framing of the marketplace isn't quite correct. To see the content you speak of, people have to buy computers or phones, and pay an ISP or telecommunications provider. The ad-driven structure you speak of was created on the premise that there was no cost to receiving the content (broadcast radio and TV) beyond the initial purchase of the receiving technology. If the US creates a free system of broadband or even wifi providers for its citizens (as it should, and run it like a utility), then your characterization would be apt.

"I feel like your nano-second glimpse at the wrestling debacle lacked a bit of nuance (yes, I hear myself there...) But the crowd wasn't just booing Beggs, they were booing the situation. The league's rules are wrong (Texas, no surprise). Sure, SOME of the crowd were bigotedly booing. But that is not the only voice of dissent. Even the IOC would prefer if female-to-male transitioning athletes fought in their desired category: male.

"Adam: ""It takes too long to learn""... plays Destiny where it takes forever to get geared to do raids. You can only learn raids in raids and it takes hours. Last I remember your gear carries over to PvP which means people with good gear just win unless everyone has high level gear (I might be wrong now).

Michael: ""I want a puzzle game!"", in a competitive shooter? Play Portal 2 coop, it's absolutely a joy to play. Asking for it in a competitive shooter is a bit... pointless?

I get it a genre isn't for everyone but the arguments are just weak against the game. Team based PvP games are at it's core a social game, if you don't want that social experience don't play them. Also you can never learn team play if you don't play in a team.",5,2,2018-02-28T02:22:19.000Z,onimateria,UC6porraLvt42Bueq8kYZv3Q,9ryZCjkkM3A,True,UgwVA1lfRnjzua__ET14AaABAg

"Good chatting as always. Though I'm not sure boiling it down to rock paper scissors makes sense as a means of comparison. It isn't really the aspect of the game that informs the experience. As an example boiling it down to that means you could compare it to pokemon, but I'd say the experience of playing each game is vastly different. To me the most significant aspects of why the game is fun, is the motion and feel of controlling the character and there is a lot of effort in making characters feel different to control. So the experience changes in a meaningful way when playing a new character.

"First off, in case Mr Swaim is reading: Thoughts on Fangoria coming back?

Now here's the post, I tried to keep it brief...
It's odd (for me) to hear that Mike became disinterested a few years ago...  I first found Cracked thanks to him & his series, then Dan & Jack quickly grew into regular media check-ins for me,. Based on the loose timeline that is talked about, which was around the time when Mike became less of a physical presence, and when some of the shorter cracked studio productions started coming out. I'm sure it's not entirely relatable, but it's interesting to me.

I like to consider myself a writer (I have a day job, but writing fiction is how I'd like to work) and the thoughts on Cracked being a platform for 'up and coming writers' hit a nerve for me, in a good way.  Ther ARE platforms for 'new' writers to submit, but, as pointed out in this podcast, the model has changed dramatically. I find if you're a Canadian writer at least, that authors have started to focus their content on 'local' audiences. I'm in the tech industry, so I also see this as authors giving up on the internet as a distribution network (I'm talking novel writers & short story writers), and video content is (sadly?) taking over.

Those are my minor thoughts. It's the internet and to be honest, I try not to focus too much on it, things change after all. I would rather be writing or reading. Which, is kind of a quirk of my personality, I suppose.

Looking forward to future podcasts!",0,0,2018-02-27T18:59:40.000Z,Kawlin Rolfe,UCnjH9pFUJzWmwxL8yolUiiw,z80bqIcJQZo,True,Ugz2rjRE8daQMiOMMI94AaABAg

"This idea that if it has no story it's instantly made into a toy, that is a little ridiculous. A game can be an experience beyond just a narrative one.

Mario doesn't need worldbuilding or a narrative experience. It doesn't add anything to the game or franchise. Oddyssey is a wonderfully polished gameplay experienced, and it feels so damn satisfying. Another example of a great game with barely a narrative is Super Metroid. It's not just simply a toy. It's an atmospheric experience.

Edit: Also comparing the videogame industry to the movie industry when it comes to innovative is a bit facetious. Indie games are all over the place and do a ton of innovative stuff. BotW was fairly innovative, especially for a triple A company, taking gameplay elements from the very first Zelda. Also Metroid being a tier below? Excuse you? Prime and Super are some of the best videogames ever. Prime especially did an amazing job at building a world and a narrative in a way only a videogame could, without only ever telling you anything. Honestly Swaim, I love you and your stuff, but when it comes to videogames it REALLY feels like you're letting your opinions on videogames be too dictated by what you want from MOVIES (and TV), without acknowleding how videogames are vastly different. If anything, Mario not succumbing to this growing trend of introducing a big narrative, is what keeps it unique. SO many videogames try to be movies, try to tell big stories, failing at it and being a detriment to the gameplay. How is it a bad thing that there are still games out there that don't introduce a plot? You say you want variety, not everything falling into the same category like movies are being Marvelfied, yet if Mario started cramming in narrative and big plots *it would be following this exact trend*. You contradict yourself, Swaim. Also, a game isn't BETTER because it has a plot. You enjoy plots, but that doesn't mean a game need it to be good.",0,1,2018-02-26T22:17:28.000Z,DeathEatsCurry,UCSBqH9R2t9RdSdp0u2XpHXA,jb6u_R5mJWk,True,UgwRVLWVJLzvQ2Adfbx4AaABAg

"Hey Michael, glad to hear from you again.  I've been watching for about a month now and I too have dealt with depression for most of my life, I medicated with opiates from ages 19-31.  After a good amount of reading I decided to try Ketamine infusion therapy (70-80% effective depending on the source/study) and it has given my life back in a profoundly different way than any antidepressant; I feel compelled to share with anyone who might benefit from at least checking it out.  I just finished my first 6 infusion series a week ago and went from feeling like every day was a 3 or 4 out of 10 to sitting at 8 almost every regular day.  The best way to put it is just relief, I don't feel overly good and I don't feel medicated.  Aside from the 50 minutes I'm in the infusion chair I feel baseline normal which includes being calm, content and confident.  There is no ""added"" feeling or lingering effects/side effects of a daily antidepressant.  
Anyway, its been so positive for me I feel very strongly about paying it forward and spreading the word.  If anyone is curious about any of it I'd be happy to answer any questions

"I think the thing about their technology that wasn't touched on in the movie is that they had a jumpstart of the rest of humanity in technological progress. While everyone else was in the iron age they were given a metal that was capable of much more. The metal itself doesn't heal you, it's their advance tech that utilizes advancements that have been withheld from the world at large. Unless Disney just wanted to make vibranium an even more convenient plot point for expedience. They have been less than subtle that a big bad purple space dude is coming and humanity will need a narrative device to up the ante and make the defence of Earth to seem more credible.

"Right off the bat I just need to point out that there's a world of difference between the ""on-hold"" joke which is just a bad joke on its own but made worse in the context of the setting, versus the ""freeze"" joke which isn't really a joke so much as a character thing. It wasn't hamming it up, smirking at the audience, in a way that said ""I'm telling a joke! Get it? This is funny because it's so out of place, right? Right??"" Instead we the audience are to understand that Black Panther froze because he was nervous/distracted by his love interest when normally he's completely focused. It could definitely be better, but mostly it's just stock movie-writing character development that's not painful but also not noteworthy.

I still like the Marvel movies, though it's popular for critics to expound on their annoyance or disinterest in comic book movies that tell a continuing story like a comic book. I don't spend much time trying to pinpoint why, but I do believe that despite surface level similarities and having the same umbrella company, there's a significant difference between what Marvel is putting out and all the other Disney action movies. I feel like the Pirates films have more in common with the new Star Wars films than the Marvel films do. Marvel plays with the formula, though never gets too far from it for better or worse, they also manage to capture the feel needed for the character's movie that they're making at the time. Whereas Star Wars is kind of all over the place now with one film contradicting the feel and tone of another and is trying to paste a copied Marvel formula overtop the classic Star Wars formula and the two just don't mix well... then on top of that they try to be surprising and expectation-subverting when not only do fans not want that but it doesn't fit with the nature of the original films they're supposedly basing things off.",2,0,2018-02-25T01:11:07.000Z,Shawn Wesley,UCh-1ssnw9jACd7okfMa70uw,BDwXwZFADgo,True,UgyB-MHjJfzT8FvhOfd4AaABAg

"Being laid off is always hard, and I think harder when it's from a creative job because you feel ""oh, I guess my creative output just isn't good enough"". It probably isn't true (maybe sometimes it is) mostly it seems to come about purely for _business_ reasons that don't give a crap about quality or people. And it can easily leave people in just the worst sort of depression and jaded personality. Especially in a city like LA. I lost a creative job back in early 2017 -- I didn't have a public-facing sort of position but so much of everything I did was art or writing that was out in the public space in the city where I live and being separated from that in what was a huge surprise to me that left me reeling and even now I'm still figuring out what I'm doing.

But the point of what I'm saying is that it's refreshing to have two people of decent popularity who got used up by a corporation and then tossed out and came out on the other side *not* being awful jaded people who are negative about everything and constantly trying to blame their former friends for everything that went wrong. The depression sucks, the uncertainty and challenge of finding your place afterward sucks as well. But I feel like this is a great example of how to move forward, doing the best to understand yourself and your peers.

Oh, and as an aside, like Dan I think that ""scheduled content"" like twitch is just the stupidest idea to go back to. We got to a point where content is there for us to watch whenever the heck we want to, at times that are convenient for us. Why on earth would I want to go backwards to missing stuff because I had to do something else at 6pm? Chat? I don't give a crap what a bunch of rabble are saying, and if the content is just someone reading comments I pass.

Figuring out the real future of content is hard to do. No one wants ads. No one wants to pay out the ass for bundles. Patreon is nice, but the vast majority can only support so many artists we like. I think that in maybe 10 years we'll see a real massive change, not only from technology but potentially from legislation and economic changes.",8,0,2018-02-24T21:18:39.000Z,Shawn Wesley,UCh-1ssnw9jACd7okfMa70uw,z80bqIcJQZo,True,UgzPIlnD0bW1j-mmTxJ4AaABAg

"i knew something had to be going on with the weight gain. the timing of this is so weird, i just got off of a serious 5-6 year heroin/pills addiction in november, being homeless for a year, in prison september/october, been to rehab like 20 times, my girlfriend of ~7/8 years ghosted me, all the hardest shit. i wasn't able to quit until i accepted that things would get worse before they got better, and that i was going to have to be okay living in a shitty situation without my drugs or anything else before i could start to get anything back. and now i have more clean time than i could ever get before, and my mind is in a better place than i ever thought it could be. i'm young though, only 24 now, so i have time to make up for it, and i'm sort of in the same boat as you are now (minus the loyal fanbase) hoping to start making my way on my own in a creative career. i have a decent amount of money coming in the next couple months to purchase equipment and space, and i really hope if things go well for me i could work with you all someday. 

cracked, specifically after hours, agents of cracked, escort mission, does not computer, ocpd, new guy, the cracked podcast, and the parody series like internet content, romcom, the star wars, and harry potter ones carried me through the hardest times of my addiction and gave me the desire to take seriously my childhood dream of becoming an entertainer. cracked had really fallen off in the past 6 months to a year and i had wondered why, but now it all makes so much sense.

just always remember that whatever you put before your recovery, will be the first thing you lose. i look forward to seeing where you guys go in the future and i hope things work out for you, and i'll be supporting you guys in any way i can, but you always have to take care of yourself and your head before anything else. if you're broken, you're not going to be of any use to anyone, especially not yourself. you'll find that people in recovery will be there for you when you need them, no matter what's going on with them or where they are. speaking for myself, i'll support you in any way i can, and i'm glad that you're following your dreams and taking risks for yourself. i'm glad you have friends who are good influences and who support you. i just started reaching out myself to old friends, and reconnected with my best friend as a teenager and started spending a lot of time with him because he wants to get into the same kind of stuff with me. don't ever be afraid to reach out, to ask for help, or to admit that you're not strong enough on your own. you have so much to live for and so much to offer, i would hate to see you fall into the same hole that effects so many of us in this day and age.

i think your idea for the pit is great. i had a similar idea myself, there's a big potential in new media (and old) for that kind of  stuff, because it's effecting more peoples' lives than ever and it's better for spreading information and warnings to protect people from falling into addiction than DARE ever could have been. 

i didn't expect this to be a wall of text, but i'm the kind of person who sometimes feels the need to speak with only the hope that somebody will listen and take it to heart. i smashed that subscribe button and i'll be on patreon doing the same",0,0,2018-02-21T17:28:46.000Z,Austin Biaselli,UC1pWt4x7O15jSQd5s1gEQug,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgwoayByrY5PVSRWUoV4AaABAg

"Ok, so, you asked.

There is a huge vibranium/adamantium history in Marvel comics. Conceptually, adamantium is a special steel that's just super (like REALLY super) strong; vibranium is a naturally (only) occurring material that has energy absorption and retention properties. Cap's shield was, for years, said to be made of an alloy of vibranium with adamantium steel that was totally indestructible because the vibranium in the shield could absorb any energy capable of affecting the adamantium, and the adamantium was so strong that it could hold the shield together long enough for any absorbed energy to disperse. (Plain old vibranium would just explode once it absorbed enough energy.). This shield story got kind of retconned later, but it's a good way to explain the difference between the materials. In the MCU, they've basically abandoned adamantium and made every magic metal vibranium, which is indestructible because it both absorbs and disperses energy as the plot demands.

Also, as far as the healing tech goes, as I read it, the vibranium isn't something that heals people by itself; it's Starman-ball type tech that only works *using* vibranium. Like, durable planes require sufficiently light, strong material, but wood / steel / aluminum do not fly by themselves without design work, fuel etc. So vibranium is necessary for the healing tech, but not sufficient.",25,5,2018-02-18T05:52:26.000Z,muddlewait,UCL-kc2fitmArkXo2pRhhnNg,BDwXwZFADgo,True,UgzzNZRC1AgcLOrUOK94AaABAg

"I have suffered from depression for at least two decades (I was diagnosed when I was sixteen, but I'd say it started a lot earlier than that) and I totally do what Soren does in terms of imagining all kinds of horrible scenarios -- I'm just not detached about it, and when I am depressed it definitely feeds the depression.  I have anxiety as well (and ADD) and I have difficulty coping when I don't know what to expect, so my protective mechanism has been to play out all of the possible ways that something could go so that I won't be caught off guard.  I do it in social interactions, I do it when I have to make a big decision, but I also do it regarding the past -- trying to figure out why things went wrong, and what I could have done differently to get a better outcome . . . it's exhausting.

I was willing to talk about and discuss things and once a solution was (to my knowledge) agreed upon, I was willing to look forward and move on. I said some dumb things and made some stupid mistakes. But at least none of it malicious.

She never told me, but left it to slowly boil until one small thing set off a chain reaction ending me being ghosted. Communication is key in any human relationship, be it friends or romances. I'm trying my best to remember that if you're not met half-way, it doesn't work.

"Louis didn't just betray the trust of these women and his colleagues, he also betrayed the trust he'd established with his audience.  Louis' brand of comedy depends on the benefit of the doubt afforded to all shock comics; If audiences think his material is sincere and not a distortion, it stops being funny and starts being a celebration of the horrible.  We don't take him seriously when he says he wants children to die from nut allergies, we accept that it's a comic perspective and not to be taken at face value.  

But listening to his old material about relationships and women, that benefit of the doubt is gone.  What's left is just plain ugly.  It's not that different from a serial-killer's trophies: He was airing clues about what he did, taking bigger and bigger chances, and in open sight.  And he was *rewarded* for it, for over a decade.  What he did was already bad enough on its own, but then he dragged *every single fan* into his perverse and arrogant game on top of it.

"(sigh) Yes, it's a fair response, you're right about that, but you kind of explained the reality of the situation with: 'If you'd lose your job as a Sears Cashier for a behavior, you should lose your career as a visionary writer/director'. Because you wouldn't lose that job for having a sexual relationship with a 19-year-old, even when it's with your girlfriend's adopted daughter--because it isn't illegal. Everyone would think you're a creep, though, and that's exactly what happened. People who aren't old enough to remember this incident when it occurred seem to believe that things were covered up and people were silenced but that isn't true. This was a very public custody battle and everyone was scandalized by Allen's behavior. Currently we're in the over-corrective phase of believing the victims of sexual abuse, so every accuser must be believed or you're a bad person or an enabler. Since most people don't seem to be knowledgeable about any information besides what comes from the Farrows, ask yourself why the eldest child in the Farrow household, the only one old enough to be fully cognizant of what was going on, has subsequently said that Dylan Farrow's account couldn't have happened where she says it did (because of the physical layout of the space), and that he witnessed Mia Farrow repeatedly coaching Dylan about what to say and what happened.

Whether it's Woody Allen or Mia Farrow that's lying, I hope they leave a letter or something to be read after their death which tells the truth so the children don't have to live the rest of their lives with this hanging over them. One of them has been lying for so long that they feel as though they can't tell the truth at this point.

Also, people seem to be conflating Allen with Weinstein in portraying him as a powerful Hollywood figure. He was certainly an influential film-maker, but he was always an outsider in hollywood. After his box office successes in the mid-'70s hollywood gave him financing because his films were cheap and on schedule. In the '90s the profit margins on his films tightened (partially because of the scandal) and hollywood largely abandoned him. For the past 20 years most of his financing has come from Europe.

The larger issue of sexual abusers in hollywood is important. Maybe instead of complaining about one bad film you could ask someone like Katy Stoll to come up with a real discussion, I'm sure she could come up with something more substantive.",1,2,2018-02-06T16:08:11.000Z,Ed Fagan,UC_bKwI60mOTNnwRY4iT9gIg,e9v4wmXaY9I,True,UgxUjPgKZJfgpFi5v-t4AaABAg

"Guys... I've listened to it twice on soundcloud. I just want to say; yes he's a weirdo, yes he did some weird stuff and yes it's all gross.. 

But the podcast is too much of just a bitchfest, without actually discussing the movie OR louis ck in any kind of objecive argumentation. Because he is gross, does not mean nothing can be said to actually discuss his thoughts in directing the movie fairly. I fear the, understandable but dishonest(subconsciously) response is based on emotionality and mob mentality, more so than 1. The concept of justice 2. Actually fixing anything or 3. Objectively looking at the gross stories of sexual assault. (Degrees of everything.. Louis isn't Cosby or Weinstein. Nor does he deserve the same response they got)

Separating art and the artist is not only a well known concept, it is almost exclusively necessary for us to enjoy any of the classical pieces, sculptures or paintings. (Chaupen, mozart and beethoven come to mind) 

Also, where are the accusations of him being a child molester coming from?  (Legit question, as the only big news to hit Ireland on louis is the jerking off in front of women  comedians grossness)

One quote to sum up what I'm trying to say;

""Not to defend louis ck, I mean fuck him till the end of the earth, go die!"" Immediately followed in the same breath but on Hellen Hunt: ""I don't feel I'm in a position to judge people."" 
Sure.. fine not to defend Louis, he did some nasty shit, but the hypocrisy is what I'm getting at.",41,23,2018-02-06T02:24:37.000Z,irishprice,UCVOoCJTryXVkhBu4aAAeYxQ,e9v4wmXaY9I,True,UgxEYoNcBH_7d5y7-At4AaABAg

"I feel like people forget all the goofy shit in the original trilogy when discussing TLJ. For every legitimate criticism of the movie, you can find a worse offense in the original trilogy.

How about a 90 minute breakdown of all the mistakes in the old movies. I feel like people who dislike TLJ give all these bad elements a pass. I love those movies, but they are badly made in parts.

"Michael! Wow! I always liked you and Daniel and Soren the most, but you man, you..that Harry Potter thing has cemented your place in my heart forever!  (I‚Äôd want to hang out if you were nearbyüò∂) I have chronic depression too, treatment resistant major depressive disorder. So, basically, I‚Äôm really fun at parties. Actually I play it off quite well tbh. And it‚Äôs really hard once you get sort of piled under with things that take awhile to accumulate, with depression it‚Äôs absolutely Herculean to be able to recover, just because something like washing the dishes is like mountain climbing, so making changes that take a lot of positive energy to really put into effect, damn near impossible. Right now I‚Äôm staring down the barrel of moving in about a week, and am only half packed. Half might be an optimistic estimation, really. 

I didn‚Äôt know you were ‚Äúone of us,‚Äù lol, although I‚Äôm not sure why not. Pretty common with intelligent, creative, funny people. Not being braggy (is that a word?) with that, it‚Äôs all just a product or products of coping mechanisms and/or subterfuge for feeling weak and stupid. Because after all, you‚Äôre only ‚Äúchoosing to be negative,‚Äù or ‚Äúbeing a downer,‚Äù or my personal favorite, ‚Äúfeeling sorry for yourself.‚Äù So you learn to be an actor, comedian, just to keep from indeed, being a bummer. Just get this horrible empty sad ache like heartbreak randomly, I didn‚Äôt think my way into it, I can‚Äôt think my way out. So feeling sorry for yourself or dwelling in negativity or any of those other things from people who can‚Äôt understand, at best, are secondary to the original crushing feeling. And oh man, god help you when bad shit goes down that would depress anyone. Lol you know already. And somehow, oddly we tend to be stronger than most. I say ‚Äúwe‚Äù meaning, the types who are sad and out of place who think way too much. And here I‚Äôve only scratched the surface of it. 

But you know, while that‚Äôs complex, everything is complex. Life is bullshit, Miroki, lol. 

I don‚Äôt know man, with you gone, you very well may have been my favorite. I really think Daniel O‚ÄôBrien is hilarious, so is Soren Bowie. For the little while I tried twitter, just to see why people like it, I had the 3 of you guts and Katie Stoll, I think her name is. You guys‚Äô random stuff (I remember a couple of Soren‚Äôs tweets making me actually laugh, don‚Äôt remember what) was all really funny stuff. I think.

"Well it's good to hear what you're up to, very best of luck with accomplishing your goals. Very sorry to hear about your troubles, I'm glad you're getting over them.

As far as Cracked goes, I understand all the reasons that you've brought to light on how things became as they are. I, personally, lost interest in Cracked when it became so politically oriented in a very partisaned way. I don't go to a comedy site to be lectured or talked down to. That's my own personal opinion, take it or leave it. I think it something to think about when it comes to being an entertainer though with your own projects in the future. Whatever side you pick involving politics, sex, religion, whatever, you're automatically going to alienate part of the potential audience by picking sides and it doesn't seem like the post 'adpocalypse' internet is an environment where turning viewers away is a good plan.

"Personally, I think the foremost reason why cracked has descended into mediocrity first and sheer mindmelting sadness second is that, instead of focusing on producing quality content, they are now an entirely social-politically minded platform.

In the old days, cracked was also about making you laugh and/or making you think. Nowadays, it's all about satisfying the self-indulgent sense that everyone else is wrong and that society is rotten to the core. Every single piece on the site now feels like a cheap set-up to bemoan ""social injustice""; every other joke is a passive-aggressive stab at either men or white people.

"Swaim, bubbie, sweetie, honey,....you‚Äôre making nothing but good points. Actually, unarguable points. But most of those points refer directly to games that emphasize aspects of ARTISTIC Expression and Narrative. Your arguments are 100 percent solid, but they are directed toward games that are designed for the Story experience, the narrative, the beauty of the game.

There is nothing wrong with those types of games, but Destiny is not that type of experience. The person you are debating stated as much and made it clear that destiny was not a game focused on narrative or backstory/emotion. He called the game for what it was, yet you compared it directly to indie titles that were objectively more thoughtful and focused on a single experience.

I think games need to be separated into Games as Art, or games as simply games. Sometimes the loop is the draw, and as long as the player isn‚Äôt being horribly taken advantage of, I think it‚Äôs okay. This leaves open other types of games as long as the separation is clear.

Surely games can be like movies. For example, I like plenty of shitty movies for reasons beyond epic cinematography or sweeping thoughtful scores. I love comic book movies for the nerdy feeling of affirmation and seeing my favorite people on screen. But epics they ain‚Äôt. I love Eraserhead for being a trying contemplation on issues that I may have otherwise been entirely blinded or ignorant to.

Perhaps this opinion is wrong, but shouldn‚Äôt there be games that are considered ‚ÄúGood‚Äù for their story content, as well as games that are considered ‚ÄúGood‚Äù for their more gameplay focused aspects? I know it‚Äôs potentially an annoying argument, but I always try to remember that games are first and foremost a hobby. 

They are indulgences that of course can reach incredible heights in terms of becoming immersed in a vibrant world of wonder and compelling narrative. But that doesn‚Äôt mean games that emphasize excellent gameplay and replay ability shouldn‚Äôt be judged on their own merits.

It all started with Play. If it transcends, then more power to the Game. If it does PLAY in a better way than before than surely that deserves some modicum of respect? And full disclosure, this comes from someone who hates destiny. But for reasons based on what it is. Hopefully not crazy, That‚Äôs all.

"Really enjoyed your conversation here. I've been a fan of GTA since 3, and I can relate to that odd, dirty feeling sometimes. This game, however, kind of broke that for me with the complete overload of content packed in. Trevor's instability and the mayhem caused by errant rampages and the simple progression of the story felt diluted by the monotony of every tennis minigame and stock exchange. I can only imagine developers pounding their heads on their desks as the news came in that someone walked by a yoga studio on the way to work, and now it was time to put together a tedious minigame. 

I found a lot of the fluff fun though. The parachuting challenges, that weird psychedelic joint mission, the heists, the tongue-in-cheek, pseudocryptic UFO stuff, the trial and error in stealing your first jet all brought me a lot of good times. The story was mundane, so was Michael after the prologue. Franklin was developed alright, I guess, depending on what ending you choose. Trevor was an interesting satire of that disconnect games like GTA tend to spawn in us. All together I think the trio works well in terms of how the story culminates. All the same, if I want to play virtual golf I'll go find a Golden Tee cabinet.

Personally, 5 ranks 3rd for me behind San Andreas and Vice City and I really recommend you guys go back and spend some time with SA. It's a game that's equally enjoyed played straight as it is with cheat codes enabled. Even without the additional technology that benefited 4 and 5, it continues to be a truly enjoyable and impactful game.

"I think each culture would have put forward their own sacrifice along time ago and were then bound to the rules. Therefore the USA would had put forward killing 5 being virgin, jock, etc whereas in Japan it was the sacrifice of children. As for the varying rules I think Provided the main aspects of their sacrifice were met (everyone dying as a sacrifice) it would have been ok but over the years humans had got cocky and had placed extra bits which weren‚Äôt actually needed but had become part of the norm (free will, etc). As for the monsters I thought they were supposed to be made from nightmares so whatever humans had thought up over the years which scared could be manifested through some vague supernatural source which had then had a facility built around it making it look like a prison whereas really it‚Äôs a bottomless pit of scary shit. I think the monsters from other horror movies like hellraiser, etc were just a a hat tip to some of the nightmares thought up by humans spanning different universes so the audience get the idea that this is where the nightmares are.

You guys were wondering at the end what was up with the Fool's pot that it protected him from the chemicals.

"I apologize for the novel here but...Thank you so much for making this. This is literally my first YouTube comment ever, because I tend to avoid situations where negativity is almost guaranteed, like comment sections on YouTube. But I found your channel when looking for you guys following the cracked debacleüò≠and this was the first thing I clicked. I struggled with drug addiction for years. I was horrendous as a teenager, culminating in me overdosing and falling into a coma. The doctors even declared me brain dead. But I wasn‚Äôt. I was awake inside and fought to make myself wake up. The doctors could only shrug and tell me it was a miracle after telling my parents to start planning for my death or vegetative state. From that point, I knew I was given a second chance and fought my addiction as hard as I could, knowing I would die if I let myself fall back into it. Several times I failed and relapsed, but I fought back every time. Today, almost 10 years from my decision to fight my addiction, I have a great life, but those thoughts and that struggle never really leaves. It haunts the back of your mind, stalks you. The why me questions follow me around. When so many of my old friends died of overdoses, why did I make it? I have PTSD from my overdose and coma, and this compounds it. I can‚Äôt even smoke weed to relax because after my coma, my reactions to drugs changed, and weed now makes me freak out and panic and think I‚Äôm falling back into a coma or having a seizure, where before that it made me relax and chill. I no longer have addicts of any sort really in my life, except for my father who struggles with alcoholism, but it‚Äôs easy to feel alone in it. Knowing these people I watch and use to laugh and make myself feel better, struggle with the same things, is so comforting in a weird way. It reminds me I‚Äôm not alone, that behind closed doors more people are struggling than you think.  I couldn‚Äôt help but comment because this was so important for me.

"Not a great read on Cemetery Man here, in my opinion. CM was a brilliant and postmodernly playful meta-horror that could have been cited in greater detail as a precursor to Cabin's self-reflective genre consciousness. (90s-era arch irony the key tonal context here...but think of the ""watchers"" and the narrative-conclusion-as-cliff-into-nothing...etc. All part of a clever play on the generic text of film, blended together with nods to the film watching gaze and its implications.)

On the topic of the character archetypes: I got the impression that Whedon was drawing some ideas from Jungian archetypes. In particular the Fool (as a precursor to the Hero) and the precosmogonic chaotic gods. The Virgin and Whore are also sometimes considered to be two aspects of the more general benevolent Mother archetype. Anywho, I'm not a Jung expert, but it would make sense for him to reference those, as the movie seems to take a mythological structure, which Jung was totes all about.",2,0,2018-01-22T16:33:27.000Z,Derek McCloud,UC1m2khiP_o5tkUJ-hznmIyw,gT0EkmJIYYU,True,UgzpQlrOqbNcqjNu2OF4AaABAg

"There's an mmo which I imagine as a close parallel to this secret murder young people group, the Secret World (legends). You got your major secret societies, templar, illuminati, dragon, phonecians sorta, then a bunch of minor societies and cabals in a UN style of governance called the council of Venice. The world runs on the idea that everything is true, so there's your undead zombies, werewolves, ghost, but then there's the ak'ab, a moth beast. Draugr, demons, huge creature made of flesh. Romero, Craven, Lovecraft,  etc., all the monsters are there but each society take painstaking efforts of hiding this to the regular world, in their own way, in turn for global dominance. The cabin in the woods are kinda like an illuminati operation. In the game, they were briefly in the old world before being kicked out to the 13 colonies by the templars. Since then, they intertwined into everything left of the Atlantic. Its depicted as bureaucracy meets wolf of wall street meets occult. Make dirty deals with angels, demons, whoever, as long as it fits their bottom line. And because its a whole pyramid scheme, they have a lot of money to r&d some crazy weapons, but it still comes down to resource management and personnel efficiency. Using that idea, the cabin in the woods team are like one branch office of a parallel society that stops one type of apocalypse, like one huge metaphorical button that resets the timer. Meanwhile the backer of the project supplies the monsters, cages for those monsters and equipment. They would have multitudes of files describing monsters, spells, ward instructions, magic items, information on other groups like Japan's operation as a whole. Have agents in the field pushing their agenda, hunting/capturing monsters with more advanced occult items, and making deals. Also the cabin in the woods team might not be the only apocalypse timer, everyone  of that world synced up for that particular sacrifice, but the captured monsters don't share from the same mythos, especially the robot, or kevin. Excluding the robot and kevin, these monsters could root back to multiple other big bads and evil gods. Other facilities could be stopping other things, some more by other secret societies, and suffer an all of a sudden destabilization by big man mclava at the movie's ending.

"An interesting conversation.

I think GTA V's main problem is that it is like a big budget action movie with several set-pieces that are pretty decent but outside of them there isn't much to it. The opening scene in Yankton, the heists and the moment where you drive into Los Santos as Trevor and stop on the overlook seeing the town are all moments that stick in my mind. Beyond that it's just a bit empty. The characters aren't compelling enough to drive you through the mundane parts of the narrative (or the mundane parts of the gameplay), I've seen first year (7th grade for you Americans) drama classes produce more biting and incisive satire than some of the stuff you can see in GTA V and the map is too big and too empty. All these things add up to an underwhelming gaming experience. Now. At the time when it was first released on PS3 it was shiny and bells and whistley enough to ignore all that but that always happens (just read the original reviews for The Phantom Menace amarite?). The size and the fact that you could do anything worked in its favour. It's definitely not aged well.

One area where I would agree with Adam and disagree with Michael is with the travelling as actually a lot of character driven dialogue occurs during those drives to and from places and missions so taking out fast travel was probably a way to deliver character development (and given you're supposed to make a moral choice at the end based on the characters I can see why they did this). Again, where this falls down is that outside of Michael (Townley not Swaim) all the characters are empty vessels or reprehensible shits with very little character development. You can sorta give Trevor a pass as a cipher for how a GTA player would look in real life but Franklin is... what? A confused mess. He wants out of gangbanging etc but does low-level grunt work for some washed up white guy? He grew up on the mean streets of Los Santos and had street smarts to survive but just trusts every fucking thing that Michael says and tells him? Nothing about Franklin's arc rings true or makes sense which I think diminishes the playing experience.

In the end I'd probably keep it because of the conversation you've had. It is a massive series and a cultural touchstone of gaming yet it is very flawed and these flaws are worth pointing out and analysing because they won't be able to release something like it again. If GTA VI goes down the same route as far as writing and gameplay is concerned I imagine they will be a massive backlash against it because of how gaming has developed in the four years or so since its release. 

Anyway I have rambled on for far too long in this comment so I will follow Michael's advice. I'm off outside to case my nearest jewelry store. Keep up the good podcasting. Enjoyed this one.",2,0,2018-01-16T18:44:03.000Z,Wavelberry,UCZV2jP0uyAiQXT8nAXCvxCw,jgRKfhgaxsA,True,UgxrGxTofSJf3Kn3gO94AaABAg

"I had quite the history of binge drinking until 2011ish. Then I went to treatment, got upset that the answer to alcoholism is to let a god or higher power take care of it. I made the motions and just decided to moderate and switch to weed. I rarely drink and have only gotten drunk like... 3 times since then, otherwise I've only had a glass of wine or a beer. Often months between without any kind of alcohol. And no hard alcohol at all. That was always hard for me to drink and drinking wasn't easy, I had to force it down until I got numb enough to drink the rest, then I could eat.
         Well, after these years I find that I feel pretty nausous nearly every day. I also realized I am a hell of an introvert without the liquid courage. But I smoke weed when I can. It's not legal here so it's more of a pain to get and of course the price is way higher. Thankfully most stoners are also charitable because it is helping with my depression. I've battled with that my whole life too but it wasn't so bad until after I quit drinking. But I have some good reasons to be depressed too. I've been trying to establish paternity to stop child support from taking half my money and let me drive and get a passport but my ex keeps making it more and more expensive by denying the paternity test. (Not easy to get 2,000 to start things when you can only make 5.00 an hour now that the minimum wage went up, and forget about getting your own apartment. Any place costs more than you make, so you need many roommates or nice people willing to let you live with them for cheap) 
        I've been through so many anti-depressants that cause me to act weird. Many make me sleepwalk or black out. Especially when mixed with alcohol. I didn't have to drink much to wake up in jail, which is why I quit. But the medication kept it happening. I just haven't been alone and homeless like I was that night. And I just stick to weed, it's not as dangerous and won't land me in jail like antidepressants can. Oh, and I just got it taken down, but some guy who was listening to the police radio that night wrote an article saying I was burglarlizing a cigar shop, which isn't what I was charged with nor was even close to doing and it took until last week to get it taken down. It's very hard to prove that something didn't happen. There's no proof when something doesn't happen, so when you need to provide proof that nothing happened... well... it's stupid.  Finally with all of my background papers I had sent them they had to finally admit there was no burglary to speak of on that date. (I did get charged with a burglary when I was 21 because of a party I was at that ended up going into a building we weren't supposed to, and to make it worse half the partiers were the vandal type who knocked over a bookshelf and took a computer, then left the computer at my place and later got in trouble and pointed his finger at me saying I had the computer to get out of trouble. I refused to do the same, mainly because I was blacked out and couldn't remember anyone and they threatened my friends and family if I didn't confess. I wasn't aware police can lie to get confessions at the time and my roommate had his father's unlicensed hunting rifle (It was a small country town) anyway, he was in college and would have lost everything along with everyone else they threatened so I said anything they wanted me to into that recorder. I was so stupid back then. Don't even have a cool story, just was blacked out and followed people. Yippee.. It got me fired from the office work I was great at and then my ex hit me with child support like a few weeks after. (And I didn't get charged until a half year after it happened and then I wasn't picked up for it until a year after that!) So, yeah.. In just a few years I managed to make it impossible to get work in what I'm skilled in, unable to make my full wage, get a monthly reminder of the abuse and rape my ex-wife did to me back when I was 18. (she was 26 and I was a very shy nerdy virgin who was taught violence is never the answer... so when she started ripping at my hair and hitting me I just.. let her.. I tried blocking at times, but I'm hairy and she pulled hair from anywhere. And I mean anywhere.. some very sensitive places just to do it, sometimes in my sleep. She also would punch me in the stomach if I was sick, I don't know why she did those things. Everything else was about control and making me feel like I was nothing) anyway, I get to think about that on loop all the time now thanks to child support, and the most they did to help is lock me up on suicide watch. I wish I had something worth 3,000 or a family that could pool together that kind of money. It's just me and my mom and we do what we can to get by each month. I take care of her full time now, she's not long for this world then I'm going to just... I don't know, no more family for me to help or to help me so.. Homeless?

"Unless I'm remebering incorrectly, there isn't more than a passing resemblance to Intensity (which is probably my favorite Koontz novel).

In Intensity the killer is the killer, and probably half of the perspective. He's also a well developed character, not a Michael Myers like inevitability.

Your persona on After Hours was literally my idol for about 2 and a half years as an angsty 12 year old that just moved to another country. I was going through a lot: suicidal tendencies, deep depression,  puberty, etc. Anyways, I‚Äôve never thanked you for your work or anything, but your funny, disgusting yet occasionally incredibly intelligent character on that show probably saved my life, or at least seriously helped give me a positive future. I wanted to be him. To some extent, I am him now, and life is a million times better. It‚Äòs terrible that it seems to have gone the other way around for you. That said, I have complete faith that you‚Äôll be successful in your future comedic endeavours, now that you‚Äôre free from the brand.

"Saw your tweet about Bright and racism, because I'm obsessed with you so I also monitor your social media accounts whilst touching myself vigorously and thinking about ways to take your face off and wear it. I'd like to suggest a different meaning behind the metaphor. The orcs chose this dark lord dude right? That's why they get treated like dog shit. Know anyone else who chose to worship a dark lord-type guy?  That's right, the nazis. 

Couple this with the common slur against orcs being 'pig skins' (what colour skin do pigs have?) and I think we can come to the conclusion that the movie is about the danger of the demonisation of the white people that we see occurring daily. But they had to hide that message under the more in-your-face message of 'don b racis to black people', otherwise there'd be outrage, like that meme 'it's ok to be white'.",1,0,2017-12-27T05:45:44.000Z,Petrifying Pumpkins,UCuSLMdTDl2TspxruCnPk7gA,CDSgx_rm34M,True,UgxZWr9MSw0o7tiPOFl4AaABAg

"I don't think phasma is dead. We'll see in part 3. I don't think Rey's parents are ""nobody"". We'll see in the next movie. I don't know what will change in part 3. I'm very excited to see though. Because just like Return of the Jedi, PART THREE can change every lingering question and doubt that I have.

Imagine if Return of the Jedi featured Han dying in the freezing process, or if we got no closure to the ""I am your Father"" reveal. Imagine if people then had said ""well Han is frozen but why would they freeze him since he's a major character??? They wouldn't have known back then, that the freezing process wouldn't kill him,...they couldn't know! There was no context! 

So it would seem silly to us now if they made those judgements before having closure. Imagine that stuff happening at first, but then...Imagine if you had assumed all that kind of garbage was going to be the truth before you saw the conclusion. Before part 3. Would that not be prematurely assuming that you know where the story is going? Should TLJ suffer now, for things that might make sense later? 

Is this a point? I thought it was, but I don't think I'm that smart. But really though, just imagine that you assumed that nothing would change or get better from Empire to Jedi. Would that affect your opinion of The last Jedi? Knowing that everything could turn?

I respect anyone who embarrasses me for this poorly formed opinion:) I know I'm grasping at straws. I just didn't mind it, and I'm excited for the next. But not trying to be a lil bitch about it.

"Why does everyone believe, that when Kylo Ren told Rey, that her parents were ""No one"", that he was telling the truth? 

Think about that. It's one small part of the points that you made, but it seems like you're accepting something as truth, in a series that was made legendary by taking a white LIE (Obi wan telling Luke that Vader killed his father) and twisted into an amazing truth!!! (Vader saying No,...I am your father!)

I know what you MIGHT say. That they didn't know that was going to be the case, and changed it when they got there. Well if that's the truth, then why not give this trilogy the same benefit of the doubt??? 

You don't know what the truth is intended to be yet. And if they end up retconning the current ""truth"" then they deserve the same courtesy that all fans gave the original trilogy.

"Mr. Swaim, I have virtually zero online footprint and rarely post any comments on YouTube (or anywhere else for that matter), but I want to share with you some thoughts;
I first discovered Cracked.com by accident several years ago, looking for a video on the Ninja Turtles for some personal research. I wound up stumbling upon an episode of After Hours and was enthralled immediately. This occurred on a Saturday night and that was fortuitous as I spend that next 24 hours engrossed in everything Cracked Video had to offer. But in truth, it was Daniel O'Brien, Soren Bowie, Katie Willert and yourself whom I fell in love with.¬†
Everything the four of you had to offer, comedically and as commentary, separate or together, was magical to me and struck me in a way I didn't know was possible. While I can truthfully say there is little I have seen from the Cracked team that I haven't loved for the past 5 or 6 years, it was the four of you who kept me on the hook, checking every day for new videos (even when YouTube had no reminders, just in case I missed it), and rewatching videos over and over.
I am saddened by your struggle and hope you can find your way through it. I can relate very strongly as through depression, severe drug addiction and self destructive patterns I managed to push everyone I cared about out of my life. I lost my family and friends. The rift in my life became so bad that I managed to miss my own father's funeral and did not even find out about his death until months after it had occurred. I have still not spoken to any of my family since 2013, but I have now been clean and sober for 4 years.
I need to offer you a thank you that I am afraid I do not have the words for. I hope you see this and understand the part you played in helping me through a very dark time, and how you continue to help me each day with my own struggle. I will be following along as you move down this new path and truly hope you find a new platform to continue sharing what you create, as I will be on the edge of my seat waiting for it. Thank you again and good luck!",0,0,2017-12-21T05:58:06.000Z,JJ Baboon,UC1vamLvKOqZlGkVXRI5snLA,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgxT7oXuGR6ELo_kekl4AaABAg

"I fundamentally don't get your complaints. They seem to be strengths. And your opinions om Nintendo's design philosphy seem deeply wrong headed.

Check out the video by Game Malers Toolkit on Nintendo - Putting Play First for an exploration of their design philsophy. It talks a lot about splatoon which alongside Arms are the new major Nintendo IPs you forgot existed.

If you don't think Mario has character because he doesn't speak you don't pay attention. He's a silent comedy character. He's kind of like Mr Bean if you want to push it.

And BotW not having a narrative? What game did you play? Why do you want a 2-3 star movie sections (cause that's most gaming narratives) n game where narrative is told through landscape, gameplay and the dialogue which is evocative and expansive and plays to you imagination not reductive and boring. 

FFXV did have hundreds of thousands of words of dialogue. And it was boring. Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian have a few and are more engrossing because of it. Zelda's lack of endless dialogie is a deliberate strength not a limitation.

If you want game narratives to be like The Last of Us - competently made and written eanna be films that are about C grade if they were judged by the same criteria as film then gaming will be tedious.  

Games like Nier Automata and a whole raft of indie games, Team Ico and Nintendo and many more are showing us how narrative in gaming doesn't need to be that amd is better for it.

Also Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga and it's sequels will teach you all about Mario stories. And are really really funny and self aware and brillaint.

Also Nintendo released new major  IPs with both Splatoon and Arms in the last few years. Have a look if you want to see new Nintendo IP.",8,0,2017-12-18T12:29:21.000Z,mytimetravellingdog,UCnC7ZtvKWxk3KPfd6yTuOEg,jb6u_R5mJWk,True,UgzAELl-BpTdw1nsKx94AaABAg

"How dare you profane Sunshine and its strange talking water gun! Don't think about why anyone might install what is essentially an AI in something that can only interact with the world by shooting liquid everywhere!

On an alternative note, I think Michael's comments on narrative in Odyssey and Mario games in general are really interesting. They make me wonder how he feels about visual novels (the ones that aren't just interactive anime peepshows anyway), which mostly sacrifice gameplay for the sake of conveying narrative through text and voice acting. In that vein, taking a look at games that are essentially interactive movies/TV shows like Heavy Rain or Life is Strange (much as I loathe it), would also be really interesting.

Oh and finally, for anyone looking for a 3D platformer/adventure game that does have some decent narrative elements, the Sly Cooper series is a must play. That's not to say it's a worlds spanning fantasy epic exploring the depths of the human soul, but it's there and I find it more fulfilling than anything any main series Mario game put forth.",2,0,2017-12-18T09:41:08.000Z,InsomniacAlopex,UC6bv2OdICrI4Mo--8kbYMKw,jb6u_R5mJWk,True,UgzAb6q77BotxjWRgxR4AaABAg

"Somehow understanding the futility of writing a long comment on Youtube was not enough to stop me from doing it. 

I don't think the infusion of humor is a result of Disney's influence so much as it is a result of younger voices participating in a story they loved while focusing on the quirkier parts they related to - it's not crazy to me that the guy who made The Brothers Bloom opened with an outer space scifi crank call. Their interactions with the antagonists feel more realistic, to be honest, and reflective of how society's perception of so-called heroes and villains have changed - Kylo Ren and Hux don't command respect and fear from everybody like Vader and Palpatine do because Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong-Il weren't as scary as Hitler and Mussolini, even though they totally, 100% should be.  

The overall message I got from The Last Jedi was one vastly different from the basic Star Wars hero's journey - it's not about special dudes doing special things that no one else can do because magic, it's about regular people making hard choices that facilitate the big, bold moves, and how the toxicity of hero worship makes everyone worse. 

Luke isn't the perfect zen master everyone (including Luke/Hamill himself) wanted or expected him to be, Poe isn't the super-cool, always-right stunt pilot dude that never fails, etc. The only guy that doesn't realize hero worship and idealization of historical figures is dangerous is the bad guy that makes his entire thing about copying Darth Vader. He's not just super arrogant, he's super entitled and touts his special bloodline and everything - he's like a space alt-righter or something.

The hero worship thing is huge, and it seems weird to me to not acknowledge the commentary that makes on the franchise as a whole - Luke was A New Hope, and that was great because it inspired everyone, but also it led to a disorganized rebellion seemingly fighting a 100% improvised war that relies entirely on crazy reckless ace pilots doing stupid stuff and getting lucky because ""lol it worked for Luke"". Once he realizes this stuff, he plays on Kylo's fascination with heroic symbolism to basically stall the entire First Order's military with an after school playground fight. 

Also weird to me is the suggestion that this version of a Star Wars movie is somehow the safest thing they could have done, considering they are literally making spin-off movies about how Han Solo beat Lando in a card game or whatever.

"Your mother is so strong and wonderful. Thank you for doing this. 
A lot of your story resonates with mine. I never realised other people got depressed as young as I did. I was nine and the doctors said I was too young to be depressed so it had to be some child condition. They put me on drugs which destroyed my memories of large periods of my life. All I remember from my childhood is flashes of painful situations, humiliation, being different and unable to connect, and one amazing memory of playing a game with my older sister where we were pretending to be dragons.
My mother fought for me. She took me off the drugs and she supported me through everything. I screwed up a lot, she was endlessly paitent with me, even when I was actively trying to hurt her, or when she had to take me out of school because I was bullied we never even considered the drugs again to help me cope. She said it was because when I was medicated I could be in the room and she could miss me. To her I was her amazing funny happy girl who had this illness we had to work through, but it was always worth it. I think my siblings at the time thought I was a spoilt brat because I would do things and my parents wouldn't punish me and that in itself was difficult but now we're all adults they understand.
So to hear your experience and and your relationship with your mother really warms me up inside.  I am also now a lawyer and I work with people who had brain injuries and have lost mental capacity to safeguard them from abuse (how weird is that parallel?).  We can't let the chemicals keep us down.",3,0,2017-12-14T11:02:16.000Z,D ruwin,UCVA2Lkgz9mgZMQ8zCz42law,dhCF9wnega0,True,UgzkPMJrckMyJdi6tVN4AaABAg

"Sorry, but this is not just a ""shrinking budged killed it""-deal. The content just wasn't good anymore. I know how this sounds, but this isn't some Trump supporter ranting at the hip kids. The stuff really got too ""SJW""-ish and politics got in front of quality.
I can give you an specific example that involves Michael Swaim.
I had almost given up on Cracked and the Cracked podcasts when I saw that one was supposed to be about why apocalyptic fiction is so popular. I thought to myself ""The podcasts have been bad lately, but that one sounds interesting."" and downloaded it to listen to in the car.
The problem was it wasn't about what it was supposed to be about. Instead of really discussing the popularity of apocalyptic fiction, all they did was to slobber over their guest, an author who - judging from what they said in the podcast - writes extremely cooky cutter, clich√©, been-there-done-that a 1000 times fantasy novels about some fantasy world where special, magical people can control earthquakes.
It was so bad and boring.
Apocalyptic fiction and its appeal is all about relateability, about normal people living in a normal, relateable world being confronted with the end of that world and about how they deal with it. As far as I can tell, nothing of the sort was discussed or even mentioned in that podcast.
It was all just about how oppressed black people are and how they are somehow, secretly super powerful and can throw around mountains and bullshit like that.

I bring up this example to show how politics harm entertainment and how they took over Cracked and the quality of the content dropped.
Even if I would wholeheartedly agree with the politics, I still would not like them to overshadow the quality and the focus (whether it is on topic or not) of the supposedly entertaining content.
But that is what happened at Cracked.
What was supposed to be entertainment turned into a constant barrage of thinly veiled propaganda.

You can dismiss this as the ramblings of some Alt Right Nazi or whatever you want to label me for daring to be critical of SJW ideology, but you're sticking your head in the sand if you do so. You're chosing to stay in a bubble and will impede your ability to analyze the failing of this or any other business.

Cracked isn't the first and it won't be the last business that is failing because it ""went full SJW"". Look at Marvel comics. Despite their successful movies, the comic business is failing hard because they too are preaching SJW propaganda to their shrinking audience instead of trying to entertain them and then they blame their lack of financial success on the audience not being progressive enough.
The political leanings of you adience are not important. Even if they are on your side, they still prefer entertainment over being preached to and clumsy propaganda. Even devout church members can be bored or annoyed by a bad, overly moralizing preacher. It is dumb and unhelpful if the preacher then starts calling them Atheists or Satanists instead of examining what he is doing.

(Just to clarify, I am an Atheist. Just bringing up this analogy to point out that not everyone who is criticizing you has to be your political enemy.)",12,4,2017-12-12T06:28:48.000Z,TrangleC,UCoikREB_4FixNdc3GZpKnEA,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgzVSWuKNzdAqdmbl854AaABAg

"Hey Michael, you don't know me but I know you... No, wait, that makes me sound like a psycho stalker, I'll start over: Hey Michael, from the other side of the planet I've been silently staring at you from the shado-- nope, we're not quite there yet, doesn't feel quite right, let's try one more: Hey Michael, I've been watching your Cracked videos and reading your articles for almost as long as you've been making those. 
While you've been struggling with depression and other problems, you were not the only one to do so and you've provided me with much needed solace at times, interesting insights at others and in general have had a much bigger impact in making my little corner of the world seem less grim than you might ever realize or imagine possible. 

(Edit was a bit unclear, rephrased) As far as I'm concerned - you and the other people who had parted ways with Cracked WERE the Cracked that I would visit over and over in order to watch and read and listen to. Seeing the material you guys put out there was such a part of my life for years now that I simply cannot imagine not doing so again. So wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be watching...... 
Dammit, everything went so well until that last part, let's rephrase it: Whatever YouTube or Twitch channel you and the other now-ex-Cracked people will be making, I will certainly follow and subscribe to.

I hate that the business of things ran counter to the will of the Talent. I can't capitalize that enough. You lot were TALENTED at being the funniest at everything. Then the Youtube channel became greatest comedic treasure trove online! And the Ladies of Cracked started showing up, more and more, and it all just kept getting better!
The whole meta-arcs of your videos, too, kept me coming back! I loved the gradual breakdown of Swaim-bot in Does not Compute, and you were the fucking GREATEST as Jarry Potter. And that one Today's Topic where you end with an E.T. style finger boop was my second-favorite TT EVER! (First goes to ""David. Bowie's. DICK!"" obviously).
And, dammit if you weren't just the greatest childlike emperor of After Hours! Somehow triumphing over Soren, when it counted. Always getting the best service.
Glad to know you haven't soured on your first love. Keep creating, we'll keep watching.",0,0,2017-12-07T03:22:43.000Z,Keith Minacci,UCN25fCZxN-7DRiEEDjjS9_A,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgwCjHv6d4ifsPrREep4AaABAg

"I've been a fan of Cracked for probably around 11 years and you've always been my favourite contributor along with DOB (along with the rest of the world I bet). CRACKED TV, DNC and Agents of Cracked I still watch occasionally and it always made me happy to see an Escort Mission pop up on my notifications (I hope Greg makes it onto Small Beans content in the future).
I've noticed in the last few months that you haven't been contributing as much and I have, as weird as it sounds, been really worried about you. So as a complete stranger (a British one at that) let me tell you that you've really made a difference to people and there's a lot of people you who care about you. I also struggle in the pit so I really admire you for what you are doing and for getting back at it. I'm so looking forward to your podcasts on the subject.
Anyway, I will be checking out your new stuff and if I come across a few spare pounds (sorry, not many bucks this side of the pond) I will try to throw you some your way.

"Skip to 2:10 to bypass his ""OMG EVERYONE I WORKED WITH WAS SUCH A SPECIAL PERSON"" and ""Cracked was my first job ever!""

Skip to 3:00 minutes if you want to skip his ""Mah projects"" talk.

At about 5:00 in he finally says that they didn't take big enough swings and were too financially tight to not take big swings.

and 6:36, he finally talks about why HE specifically left cracked and it appears it's because he's a boozer that worked from home all the time and has depression and anxiety.

So lets recap.

Dude loses his only job that he's had for 11 years, worked from home, drank a half a bottle of jameson a day, but loves everyone he's worked for and didn't think that crack took enough risks.

You could have summed this entire video into 10 seconds.

I'm so excited to see what you do next.,0,0,2017-12-06T00:18:53.000Z,cestjeni,UC3FrtadJPJJL7JYucKfaEww,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgylVlg6uOJAKLCg-YN4AaABAg

Well done. This couldn't have been easy and hopefully it's the first step in a brilliant new direction. I know I'd totally give some money towards a film!,0,0,2017-12-05T23:50:20.000Z,Richard Waters,UC8WePObY7OG03I4QN0D9IbA,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgwZm8Wsr92oORTBNZR4AaABAg

I'm hoping the best for you guys. I was really depressed and lonely a couple years ago and that's when I found Cracked.com and your video content helped me through tough times. A couple times I started having panic attacks and would watch Agents of Cracked or Cracked TV or some other random video to calm myself. So thanks for all your work. The podcasts sound good :),127,2,2017-12-05T23:46:46.000Z,DawnViolet,UCVRj17ayNSUPWv3-YCcm_8g,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgzOJqPPBNLooEZ2yAl4AaABAg

I'm so so happy that you're doing better now, and I'm going to try to send good vibes through the universe that things continue to improve for you. I'm really looking forward to your future artistic endeavors, unfettered by company oversight! I've always liked your content, and as someone who is very fickle about comedy that's quite an accomplishment in my book.

"I got into a fight about four/five years ago. The other guy got hurt (I'm not gonna go through the deets because it'll sound like I'm trying to make myself look innocent, or justify bad behaviour), but that was when I started to drink. Worried about letting my family down. Your description of depression, sounds exactly like my own experience. I wallowed in depression for five years, until I realised drink is not the answer. I am 54 days into sobriety, and I feel good about it. Wish me luck! I wish it you xx",173,11,2017-12-05T23:41:25.000Z,Al DEE,UCtt34ktUZLo12Uue3ix4VOw,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgwnqsjImjStpMRa66F4AaABAg
"Thanks for the answers, Mike. 

A lot of us fans have been wondering what the fuck happened. 

I've loved Cracked for the past decade and I can't believe how close my guess was to the actual reason why everybody got fired. 

It's so sad what money does to creative freedom. 

Good luck with everything, Dude.  Congrats on the sobriety, i know the struggle with depression and alcohol, stay strong!",159,0,2017-12-05T23:40:48.000Z,James Tuthill,UCb2PmzPI2Xb97__GNF4IVxQ,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgyAqwircovwMglPSad4AaABAg
"This is THE new format. Personal stories over game videos. More like this, Mr. Swaim.
Kudos for sharing your self. It helps normalise these struggles and reduce stigma.
I'm an addictions worker. Hearing this stuff makes it more likely for others to share and get help.
Thank you.
Loved your work for years, right back to Cracked TV. Look forward to whatever you throw out in the future.",153,4,2017-12-05T23:38:11.000Z,Graham Woods,UCVBf-DK6mrGxjZGQAlkp1pg,GNdwD8gQbSU,True,UgwhMNwICHP9AVUyL194AaABAg
