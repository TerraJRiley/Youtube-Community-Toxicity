"Taking comfort in religion? Sure! Thinking Jesus is cool? Why not. Saying god deserves love and worship? No, descriptions of god do not depict him as someone I think deserves to be worshiped or liked, he is abusive, vindictive, petty, manipulative, and controlling. Even if he wasn't all those things I still see no reason why something as apparently omnipotent as god is would limit creation to just us and see no reason why he'd care about the billions of tiny people he made on a whim, if god exists as described he has more in common with a lovecraftian horror like azathoth or shub-niggurath than the caring creator Dad people try to sell him as.

"So long before I knew I even liked girls at all, I was dating a guy (I‚Äôll call him beanie boi). We were close friends with a few older couples, and a pair of twins (B&Z). So one day after a rehearsal for a show, a group of us went to the park for a double date + the twins. The other couple was beanie boi‚Äôs brother and his gf. So the six of us had to cross a small stream, and being the gentle man he was, beanie boo held my ha d while I cross the log. When he went across, he fell face first into the stream. This date is going great. Said stream branches out into a big river, and Z abandons B on a small island of sand in the middle. The other couple stay behind while beanie boo takes me to a spot with a really pretty view of the river. We stopped at another pretty spot, which was a mini cliff maybe 15-20 ft above the river, with a small tree right on the edge. So obviously beanie boi grabs onto the skinny trunk to look over at the river, when his beanie falls off his head. He let‚Äôs go of the tree and I grab his arm so before he can fall, and in the process he throws his beanie behind him onto the grass. While he‚Äôs pulling himself together, I grab the beanie and put it on. He goes to take it off my head, so I respond with: ‚Äúyou either leave the beanie, or you have an angry girlfriend whose hair you messed up. Your choice‚Äù he raises his hands in defeat and we proceed our way back to the group",0,0,2018-09-25T17:09:02.000Z,Isabel K,UC0IjMIXwaA0O9sj7fhTNMpA,pDDki2scplU,True,UgwxTMoydclErLbCZid4AaABAg

dont think wrong i just jumped in and asked about the vocals or something relating to music

"Okay I am wayyyyy late here and I haven't finished the video yet but some random but interesting information about the post about men thinking periods are gross because they want women to be pregnant all the time: I always thought periods seemed like a terrible trait to have from an evolutionary perspective, because it'd make it easy for predators to find you and make it harder for hunter gatherer women to be productive. However, according to a national geographic article I read on human evolution like two years ago, prehistoric women generally spent most of their time either pregnant or breastfeeding while they were fertile, so they didn't experience periods as often as most modern women do. Also, girls/women have been getting periods progressively earlier, so a prehistoric hunter gatherer woman probably wouldn't start her period at 12 which is the average age today.

"I do not believe that it is wrong to love someone that you can‚Äôt have, because people can‚Äôt control who they love. I may be biased because I am a person who happened to fall in love with a teacher of mine after two years of knowing her and talking very personally with her, but I would never force something that she didn‚Äôt ask for because I would rather she was happy than I am. So no, it‚Äôs not wrong, but it would be wrong if you were trying to date someone who was still your teacher or if they were married already, which she is, which is why I stay in my lane. I am very tender towards her and I have so much love for her that I take opportunity to express, but I still realize I need to stay in my lane. 

TLDR; people can not control who they love, but don‚Äôt start harassing your teacher. There are ways to express your affection without it becoming creepy or crossing the line.",0,0,2018-09-24T23:59:03.000Z,Wolf Maiden,UCx2C2cUazISX5vzTWqfq8fQ,RgyROYtnWtk,True,Ugx9zFZ4BonwR6G1Hbh4AaABAg

"CRUSHES are innocent and okay. Trust me, there are plenty of young and attractive teachers. I had a math teacher who was like, 25 and she was one of my first lesbian crushes. but that's it. A CRUSH. Something very innocent to where i just thought she was pretty and got a bit flustered, but nothing more. I didn't want to date her or actually be with her. I was like, fourteen. My friends had a crush on our science teacher because he was cute and in his mid twenties. He was very funny and i think it's normal to find a young, funny and 'dorky' person attractive. I mean, they're still humans lol. I don't think you can actually help if you get a crush. Just don't make it cross that innocent line. 

There's a fine line between a crush and a legit fantasy. 

And I think TV is playing a huge role in this disgusting student-teacher culture. Teacher crushes have been around since forever, but now there are twice as many shows that have this horrible 'sexy' idea of dating a teacher. And it's so wrong. Tumblr isn't helping either.

"I have no idea why youtube threw me this in my suggestions. So far I've only watched one of your tumblr deep dive videos, and I can see you have a somewhat large female following.
I'm 25 years old, I've graduated but never worked, I have a lot of emotional struggles, and I'm an incel (that doesn't really mingle or frequents with other incels or incel forums). One of the reasons I don't really mingle with other incels is because I usually take the blame/responsability onto me (to highly unhealthy levels), instead of blaming other people like most incels do.
This is... weird but... I feel like you're trying to come from a place of understanding, but ultimately fails at it because... Well, it is not relatable to you. Even if, as a women, you're close to this kind of experience, because of the way society is, you have not gone through the same kinds of experiences and rejection.
If you are a woman and even a slight step into the attractive side, just understand that you'll not be able to understand the levels of rejection some men get.
I'm not talking about high school bullying or social anxiety. I'm talking about systemic solitude. From being the last to be picked for stuff; not being remembered for anything; from being able to count on your fingers the amount of times someone makes you a genuine compliment; inaptitude to make friends; having a room's mood die as soon as you step in; seeing physical cringe from people you approach; to things as never being seeing as attractive, redeemable, likeable; to having the seats next to you in public transportation be the last to be filled in even when it's literally too crowded; to being rejected by people using literally all excuses in the book. All things that can be furthered by broken homes or absent parents, making problems that basically persist through out your life.
Most women won't ever, ever come close to understand the level soul crushing loneliness, because even if through vapid or exclusively sexual encounters, someone will always have some level of attraction and interest towards you, and even if it may not be a substitute or ideal, you will never go through the same level of solitude, because at the end of the day, you can lower your standards and settle for something worse, but a lot of men, a lot of incels, are already the bottom of the barrel.",1,2,2018-09-24T18:13:45.000Z,jpcsdutra,UCJVyVvNewaVTPnyhkcGQz0w,jJvDMKsy8D8,True,UgwVq-dz46kNSPrGTil4AaABAg

It was mainly because it was the first time a grown man (he was young about 23) had actually paid attention to me and complimented me on how smart I was so I got my feelings confused.

"I don't think any voluntarily sex is criminal, irrespective of age.   And I will fight for anybody's right to have sex with anybody else, as long as it's mutually desired by the parties involved, nobody has any god damn right whatsoever to interfere those people's freedom.  Freedom is basic and essential to all human beings, irregardless or race, gender, religion, or age.  

If you disagree with me, answer me this :  why do you think you have the fucking right to tell other people you have hever met before in your life or that are not you, who they can have sex with?  Are you comfortable with other people telling you who you can and can not have sex with?  Who appointed you as some imaginary god that can decide what other people are allowed to do with their bodies based on nothing more than what age they happen to be.   

""Ew"" and ""Creepy"" are not valid answers.  Fundamentally, it comes down to this one question:  why do you oppose and stand against freedom for other people based nothing more arbitrary than how many days it's been since they were born?  Why do you stand against freedom, period?

"(Note: this comment is addressed to all adults, especially parents) I know you think it's gross, and I think it is too now that I'm older and more mature, but having sexual crushes on adults as a kid is quite normal, especially when going through puberty. In fact, it's just as normal as masturbation, which can occur as early as in the womb. Humans, as a whole, are sexual creatures. Most of us are born that way. The key is to be open when having these discussions with our children, just as we should be open to topics of sexual orientation, violence, racial discrimination, and so on. They can handle a lot more than you think, but if you just keep shutting them down with, ""that's disgusting"" or ""big ew"", it's just going to get worse, because then they feel like they can't talk about it and work through their obsessions. Listen to them, no matter how uncomfortable it makes you, and tell them that you understand where they're coming from, but also talk to them about why it's wrong. I can't guarantee there will no longer be kids that have sexual fantasies about their teachers (because again, it's normal), but I don't have any doubts that the level of obsession will drastically decrease. I also think it's important to hold kids accountable for their harassing behaviors towards their teacher crushes. If we keep making excuses for them, they will never learn, and they will carry that obsessive trait for as long as it goes unpunished--maybe even for the rest of their lives.",1,0,2018-09-23T13:36:12.000Z,Meranda Robey,UCFEtHdXYpzEEg1ibqv-kXZA,RgyROYtnWtk,True,UgzkcHYoDMdcBNajaN54AaABAg

"So I‚Äôm ending grade 9 and I have this Physics teacher (a fat 50 year old) who always gives me extra attention. From the first lesson he had always looked at me more than others from my class. Never gives me detentions, even if I talk for 40 minutes with my friends. We have kinda prom/ball every year and he told the whole class that white dresses look the best (I was wearing a white dress), and that HE HAS A VIDEO OF ME PLAYING THE FLUTE. HE FUCKING RECORDED ME ON HIS CAMERA AND TOLD THE WHOLE CLASS THAT HE HAS A VIDEO OF ME. When he announces our grades he always asks me whether he told me my grade. He is soo creepy, even my friend noticed that. And right before he became our teacher, my class teacher told girls not to flirt with him. Wtf? Maybe it has already happened to someone? Why would she even tell us this? I‚Äôve never had a C in his class. I‚Äôve told my mother about this and she just doesn‚Äôt believe me. I mean, she never gives a fuck about me but this is crazy.

"The first generation of Furbies had an absurdly sophisticated AI, when you consider that they're a toy. Word on the street is that government agencies banned them from areas over a modest level of security, because of how the AI in them can be trained to record what it hears.

One of my step-brothers had a girlfriend around 1998/99 who had a robotics scholarship, and had about three Furbies, with some kind of nebulous plan to hack them and have wacky hijinks, but she wanted to observe the AI in action, and you really needed at least two, to get the most out of them. The one that you got first could be taught things and easily teach each subsequent Furby, making the ""learning process"" for every new Furby shorter, as the ""older"" members of the Furby hoarde would teach the newer ones.

One of Tanya's, though, was INSANE, and as luck would have it, it was also the oldest one in her hoarde, so she was reluctant to dismantle it for the longest time. What it would do, was it would suddenly bolt awake, every night, at about 2:30am, and start singing VERY loudly, waking up the others - free of the other two would start crying, and the third would start yelling, including swearing. In spite of every attempt to train it to stop doing this, it wouldn't, so short of putting it in another room (which was not an option for her, at the time), she had no other choice but to hack its circuits - but she dumped my brother before I could see how that panned out, but I like to think that it didn't work and, it's out there, somewhere, still singing every night at 2:30am...",1,0,2018-09-23T06:33:15.000Z,Ruadh√°n,UCuA7XnlRuQWb8holK1kpUtg,F_AeqmpnUSU,True,Ugzqs16FDa1kcxrcob94AaABAg

"imo toxic masculinity isn't real and it's just guys being ourselves. i think that it's perfectly fine if a guy doesn't want to tell his problems to someone else, or being overly competitive in sports like wrestling. people who act like that stuff is bad is just stupid, because it's who we are. personally, though, i don't think rape, abuse or violence is apart of toxic masculinity. partially because it's not only men who preform these actions, but it's also just purely the result of a man or woman who can't grow a set of steel and get a partner or solve an argument normally, so they just force themselves on other people in order to get their way. 

another problem of mine is that everyone sees only the radicals of a political party, like you demonstrated in the video. you only see the radical feminists, the KKK, or the 20 year old college students in all-black throwing bricks through windows when you think of the opposing political party. it's never the nice guy down the street who happens to support trump, or the nice Hillary supporter next door who is one-hundred percent for equal rights. it's a problem and it makes me mad that when i think of BLM i just think of a bunch of white guys who think they're being inclusive by smashing windows with bricks.

the last example hurts me especially since Michael Brown's own mother shopped at the Straub's that my dad worked at, and they were always friends, yet so many republicans view her as the sum of all evil, simply because people didn't listen to her and they were too lazy too dig any deeper. i moved away before Brown's death, but i remember she was always nice, and she even - after her son's death - told people to not be aggressive publicly, but to be peaceful and nice. a lot of people straight up didn't listen to her. and sadly, it's never the nice, sensible people who represent a group, it's the bad, radical and loud ones that do.",1,0,2018-09-22T20:12:42.000Z,uncle robby,UCCEmgBtVRrNEwZmldDQJejw,9RuXrlASic0,True,UgyOfTn4uk0rTexA2hh4AaABAg

"Sub-Joint Virus strain: Rabies virus: This joint strain of rabies mentally degrades the victim to the point where they intentionally infect themselves with another strain of rabies virus. Refusal for vaccines is always a symptom. Refusal for treatment is always common. In cases, victims might be able to control their urge to infect, but if they attempt to bite, get to a safe place or just run. And if they successfully do bite though, get to a medical clinic immediately. Victim will never get treatment unless somehow forced to, or manages to realise that rabies is extremely dangerous. This joint strain waits until one of the following lethal symptoms kick in until finally exiting the body through excretion or any other rabies transmission routes: Brain Death, Coma, or Seizure. Secondary but also potentially lethal symptoms are Difficulty Swallowing, and paralysis.

Luckily, this strain is EXTREMELY rare.

"I'm just going to throw my two cents in here. Wicca was created by a British 'Druid' (which is essentially Christianity using mildly pagan ritual aspects as part of the practice) in the 50's in order to make a watered down version of what he considered paganism to be, completely disconnected from the real faith, in order to make ""witchcraft"" appeal to Christians and average people. True Pre-Christian Pagans such as myself, a Celtic Pagan following an ancestral, handed down belief system over 5,000 years old, don't believe Wicca is a real thing. It isn't real Paganism, it has fake deities, fake practices, and annoying people who shove it in everyone's faces and claim to be magical. Its fucking annoying. Wicca isn't real Paganism. It isn't real Witchcraft. If they wanted that, they'd have to be comfortable with it's other aspects such as the violence, evil, and darkness that resides in it as well. Instead of practicing it all in balance, they just practice a made up system based off of Christian ideals that focuses on light. One big difference is that the true statement isn't ""If it harm none, so mote it be."" It's simply, ""So mote it be."" Our Gods don't like cowardism, and as such, we don't even bow to them. War and blood play a huge part in it as well and they entirely overlook it. Not a real branch of Paganism. More like a child playing pretend.",0,0,2018-09-21T15:17:41.000Z,Caleb MacMoyer,UC6tOWdjrLhWEmk9E3y_6sMQ,8GP2EfVP24Y,True,UgzBSTtBF8L4zEjw5lN4AaABAg

"my ex boyfriend (who ended up sexually assaulting me, but lets not focus on that rn) was sexually attracted to his cousin. I went to his parents house with him for christmas in 2017 and the entire time i was both disgusted by how white trash his family was (obsessed with guns and politics and hunting, mind you this is canada so people like this stand out) but for a period of time his cousin went to the bathroom to shower which was in this corner of the house's upstairs hallway where theres only a closet and said bathroom. my ex goes upstairs like five minutes after his cousin gets in the shower and they both were upstairs for about another ten to fifteen minutes, his cousin comes downstairs in a towel and goes to the basement (where he had his sleeping bag, remember this was like a family holiday sleepover thing) and like another five minutes go by before my ex comes downstairs, and he is visibly like red faced and awkward. Do i think he cheated with his cousin? yes, because my ex was white trash and admitted he had ""sexual tension"" with his cousin, and i caught him cheating twice afterwards. moral of the story is he was gross and a piece of shit",0,0,2018-09-20T22:58:14.000Z,y,UCJWUcmP_p7p7TYk11gN5hkQ,x1Jptp72oRE,True,UgwD1Myv867eOX5hQv14AaABAg

"As an 18 year old I was in an extremely inappropriate, beyond unequal and incredibly abusive relationship with a woman who was 10 years older than me and had initially been essentially my supervisor at one of my jobs. She was married but had ""never had a gf before and wanted to try it."" We started working together when I was 17 and I am convinced she purposefully waited until I turned 18 before she started pointing out (what arguably were in hindsight) unhealthy and abusive things about my current boyfriend, helping me break up with him so she could have me for herself. It's taken years to deal with this. Kids, please, for the love of god, I don't care if you're 18 and you think you know what you're doing. I don't care what they said or what lies they told you. I don't care how you've managed to justify it in your head.

Most time those people are extreme social incompetent. I got hate toward women when I was 19, but now I got maturity and I'm full feminist and understood me I got problems, not women. It began when more and more female said me I'm cute or sexy and but I failed to get any date. Then I realized I did not have a problem with women, but with men too, with everyone, everyhuman. How can you get women if you have zero, i say you ZERO, social interactions, zero friends, no social life at all, how can you get date at all? I worked a lot on my physical appearance and got nothing.  I noticed that some ugly guys were having relationships with uber sexy women, and some not sexy men, no abs, fat arm, geek clothing, were hooking up 10 women in their workplace. My jaw dropped off. So everything is friend, social network, personality and be cool. Those incel are just creepy. You can't get girls if you say things like ""in the end, rape is not so bad' lol.

"yeah it's weird... as an active user of Tumblr since the age of maybe 13(?) I remember the teacher crush and sub/dom communities being at their peak some time around 2012 - 2015?? I've seen some posts on this recently, users remarking how odd it was that not so long ago a lot of girls on Tumblr were romanticising Lolita and this whole fantasy of being super feminine and child-like - ""nymphets"", and wanting to seduce older men with the idea that most older men look like hot Hollywood actors. I distinctly remember all these aesthetic posts about things like lingerie, lollipops, Lana Del Rey lyrics, handcuffs, teddybears, hyper femininity and masculinity... etc and another thing that was closely associated to these communities was the pressure to be tiny and skinny, because being a dainty and fragile girl was part of the whole fantasy. I remember a few teen users who were part of the sub/dom community eventually up ended getting into some really bad situations, one example being this teen who found some sleazy guy on a sugar daddy dating website and her parents found out and it led to all sorts of police investigations and she eventually quit Tumblr. It's so strange how quickly things have changed since then, the TCC is probably dying out because romanticising age gap relationships is less of a thing now, young teens are a little more informed and savvy now -maybe it's a far stretch but perhaps the MeToo movement has had some impact on that, that and possibly they're young adults now who have grown out of their crushes.",0,0,2018-09-20T02:22:34.000Z,Nathasha Orlando Kappler,UCKjGAYCEc36nRuhSbGCQKEg,RgyROYtnWtk,True,UgyY3V4rLZp2rvjkeIx4AaABAg

"I think having a crush on one or a few of your teachers is a natural part of developing, but you shouldn't embrace it. It isn't mature; getting over it is a part of maturing. Girls instinctively want someone who can take care of them; that doesn't mean it should be reality when you're 15.

I had a few myself. I was never comfortable with them, thinking about how they were married and knowing how young I was. I think what definitely was the catalyst is you think being with someone mature would make you mature, wanting to be an adult because while your yearnings are becoming adult, your body, including your brain, is lagging behind. Obviously you cannot suck the maturity out of someone. Or the intelligence, the full development, or the familiarity and kindness toward you (which is really an interest in your academic success and not reciprocating your feelings), or anything else you see in your teacher.

At the same time, you are really still innocent. I wanted to do no more than kiss them.

Obviously, if they liked you back, it would not stop at that.

I had a lot if trouble having crushes on guys in school because they were so much more immature than me, even the guys who were above me in grade. I was really cautious about getting attached to boys who I knew would only screw me up. My friends dated, and it never lasted, and it caused a lot of problems with their parents and a lot of stress on them. I didn't date anyone all through high school. 

Who I'm with now had a girlfriend and I was merely friends with.

I wonder if any of these people are in college? Because that makes it a lot better. Basically as scandalous as dating within the workplace; mainly what is wrong with it is that they grade your papers. I don't really see anything wrong with it if they are no longer your professor.",0,0,2018-09-19T20:01:18.000Z,SwordLily,UC-A-xHzEMWneR0XTR_TKjaw,RgyROYtnWtk,True,Ugz64CNelR_YzZk44C54AaABAg

I'd challenge you to try to look past the often cringey and hypocritical people that call themselves Christians and instead study the teachings of Jesus and His Church.

I'm gonna preface this by saying I am incredibly anxious and on guard around men, and went through a phase in my teenage years where I'm ashamed to admit I generalized men due to a combination of ongoing childhood trauma, and watching my friends get their hearts broken.

The only difference between me and these man-hating radfems is I recognize that these are problems with ME. Yes, I have been traumatized by men. But lumping all men in with the ones I have unfortunately had to deal with makes me no better than the misogynists who generalize women. I have a couple of amazing guy friends, and I my emotional response to men is something I'm constantly working on.

"The comment that was on this site about a homeless chick just getting on tinder and her problems being solved is hilarious. I ended up homeless beginning of this year and you know what? Men were the worst to me. They just tried to molest me in whatever public place the crossed my path. Would get mad when I would run away after having a dick flung out at me after saying I wasn't interested in seeing it(the few that I guess at least asked. Tho didn't listen so for what that's worth) and that's just how 90% of them even attempted to start taking to me. And then they'd say things oh come on if we fuck at least you can get off the street for an hour or so. None of them even had the intention on l letting me sleep there if I slept with their grime asses. So no I got to say that horny men didn't rescue me from the street. They just made the worst time in my life even harder because I had to be more than hyper aware, more than polite about it. It didn't matter if I explained I was tired dirty gay trying to get to a job interview NONE of them would take no for an answer and all of them thought that the offering of their dicks was the prize I was winning. The fact that no one can hear a no thanks without getting angry is terrifying. I never get any sleep nowhere is safe... And anyone who thinks that sex is equally pleasurable to men and women just by getting pounded tells me that your sex is not the prize you think it is. As a man you are A) programed to procreate any and everything and B) get off every time from the most vanilla version of the act the woman A) is programmed to be choosy since she can only get pregnant 1 time and then has to use her body as eggshell yolk and incubator which is all a strain and potentially dangerous etc B) without a thoughtful lover it's a waste of my time to take that risk. If you aren't even getting off and the possibility of becoming an incubator with legs there's literally nothing in it for the woman on it's face. 
Yes I suppose if other agreements on different things were made before hand then having bad sex for some kind of material gain isn't a huge end of the world. But literally no dude if offering to take care of you in any way shape or form or turn you into a house wife etc. They just want a hit it and quit it and are offended when it's not that easy. Are disgusted at 'whores' etc. Well if you aren't bringing anything to the table but your dick there's nothing in it for the other side to risk it. Were biologically programmed to cost benefit analysis your proposition. An hour in shelter in your moms basement or 1994 Saturn is not a high enough benefit for the risk it entails. Stds, pregnancy, rejection of more preferable mates in the future, visit physical violence, permany injury and in some cases death stemming from any of the prior mentioned categories.

Well what if the teacher is an awful pedo and tricks the poor child into thinking that they like each other and takes advantage of them? It has not happened to me but last year when i was in 7th grade my 28 yr old teacher i feel like was always looking at me and kinda lusted after me and it really made me self conscious when i had his class every single school day.

I think that teacher crushes are normal and mostly harmless. It's only when you act on them that it gets weird.  When I was 15 I had a huge crush on Mrs Miller my English teacher. She had a wonderful fun personality and a great body.  In fact all the guys seemed to have a crush on her.  But I knew she was at least twice my age and that nothing would ever come of it.

"It's most likely fake, or someone with deeply rooted mental issues. It is impossible to be ""born with rabies."" Rabies is only transmitted after an incubation period which can range from a week too years, depending on where the bite was, since the virus can only travel through the nervous system. When the virus gets to the brain and the slightest symptoms begin to rear their head, which can range from headaches to numbness depending where it landed to begin with, you are completely and utterly fucked. You are dead, done, gone, and your end is nigh. Without vaccination, rabies has a 100% kill rate. *No other fucking virus has a 100% fucking kill rate.* Headaches and numbness leads to hypersensitivity and an itching anxious feeling. The anxious feeling leads to an utter disgust of water, you gag at the sight of it, you are frightened, surrounded by ladies and men in labcoats, once known family members sobbing, wondering who they are. Oh and the thirst, you are so thirsty, your mouth is a desert, but the sight of liquids make you want to hurl. You can't drink but you would die for one. After that, the neural degeneration begins, you go paralyzed, you can't talk, swallow, or take care of yourself. Your final hours are spent frightened, thirsty, and surrounded by people you don't know. *The. Fucking.

"if you haven't already watched it, ContraPoints made a really insightful video about incels.  the gist is basically that incels don't use their ""political views"" the way people use politics at all, they essentially use it as a form of digital self harm to the point where they lose all hope in life and are able to do terrible things (such as killing multiple people).  my original view of incels had just been ""oh they cant get laid so now they hate women"" but contra's psychoanalysis was fascinating and it further shows how harmful and wrong the mentality is.

"Oh yeah, cherry pick things you wanna read about radical feminism to reinforce your preexisting biases and don‚Äôt even bother to take the time to contemplate and absorb actual literature on it. It‚Äôs pretty clear you deliberately focused on the most nonsensical, absurd posts to point and laugh at. Some individual radfems say embarrassing things but that doesn‚Äôt define radical feminism. You‚Äôre gay, so you should care that biological sex is a thing. You can‚Äôt identify out of your sex, because it‚Äôs an objective reality, just like you can‚Äôt identify out of being a lesbian. Whether or not you have xx (female) or xy (male) chromosomes is determined as soon as your dad‚Äôs sperm fertilises your mum‚Äôs egg. Lesbians have been treated like shit since the dawn of time because of their attraction to the same sex, you‚Äôd know that. Trans women were never in the picture. Attraction has nothing to do with how someone feels or identifies in regards to their sex, because someone‚Äôs sex is unchangeable. 
Going by your logic, it would be okay for a conversion therapist to set you up with a dude who identifies as female right? They see him as male and in getting with him you‚Äôd be proving their belief that conversion therapy works. But if you don‚Äôt want to get with him, even though you know you‚Äôd be making him feel invalidated if you didn‚Äôt, why not? What would be your reasoning? Could it be that... You‚Äôre not attracted to men no matter how they appear, behave, or feel? The sooner you stop trying to run from a truth that‚Äôs observable in every living species on this Earth, the happier you‚Äôll be. Trust me. I used to think the way you do and I get that it‚Äôs easier to just say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, let people live!‚Äù and not put too much thought into things but that never makes you right.

"While I‚Äôm an atheist and supportive of the lgbt community. There is more of an argument than ‚Äúgod said so‚Äù for promoting long term heterosexual monogamy. It is simply is the most efficient family unit for child rearing. Any other method either doesn‚Äôt expose children to a healthy influence from role models or takes larger family units. There is a reason that over time societies tend towards long term monogamy as they progress technologically. Once your society starts to progress you need as many well raised children as possible. That being said societies reach a point of excess wealth and resources that life expectancy sores and infant mortality plummets. The need for efficient breeding and child rearing is lessoned. This combined with newer safe sex methods means societies can function quite well without strict sexual norms. This has repeated itself in essentially every society.

"Fun fact. Homosexuality is listed as a sin (in mine and some others opinions) because in those days you could die from gay sex (or any sex really) from STIs such. That's why male-female and especially monogamy was pushed, God wanted to protect his people. Also circumcision was to prevent infections cus they lived in the desert and nobody wants to lose their dick (or die from losing their dick) because they got sand in their foreskin. I'm sure there are other things in the Bible with logical reasoning but basically instead of God trying to explain science people hadn't discovered yet he just made laws and made stuff sinful as a power move to protect them.

"Teacher crushes fucking suck; I've had this one for a bit over a year now. 




I literally chose not to take a class I kind of wanted to take because he was the only one teaching it, and I really didn't want to spend another year being near him. Nothing wrong with the guy himself, but being in the same room with him made my heart thump a little too fast for my own comfort. Plus, just because of this stupid little infatuation, I didn't have the nerve to ask him if he thought I could take it anyway(it's a difficult class, and he wanted people who were interested to ask him first before signing up). 

I don't indulge like this community does, and I'm really trying hard to suppress it and just make it go away. It is NOT healthy(it stressed me tf out and hindered me in the classroom), and obsessing over them isn't going to help the problem. Not only are there impossible odds of reciprocation, but it's just...the concept of it is pretty gross. It ain't right.

"A common issue I ran into when it came to organized religion is that even though everyone there had positive and loving ideals, only a few of them really embodied them. Some of them were truly loving and accepting of everyone even if they had different ideas, and could get along with vastly different people without much of an issue. However, everyone else I met were CONVINCED that they were good people because they were following the rules and in turn, looked down on anyone who didn't follow what they believed to be right. It's this judgmental attitude that plagued the environment of the religion, and it made you feel unwelcome because most the people there liked to think they knew better about the choices you should make. The ideals are nice in theory, but because those people believe they always know what's right, a lot of them will be judgmental of others instead of supporting them through whatever stage in their life they might be in. The people you meet in these religions that are truly living up to a lot of those traits (and are absolutely wonderful to be around) are always a million times more humble than the people who end up being hypocrites.

There is though a HUGE issue of pedophilia and actual CP on tumblr. I briefly used that site to conduct business and realized it was a mistake when men and women with actual CP on their blog would contact me. These people need tumblr to establish a connection. They use discord and wickr groups to share links and photos and videos.

"This is what's wrong with MGTOW. Male separatists seeking brotherhood and self-improvement get lumped in with incels and male supremacists, and MGTOW's big-tent catch all entryism strategy not only makes it easy to strawman, but forces people to defend people they don't agree with or like. Kind of like how egalitarian feminists hate being strawmanned as being female supremacists.

I take it you aren't aware of the r/MGTOW and r/MGTOW2 split on reddit. r/MGTOW2 was formed after Incels, MRA's, and PUA's took admin positions, hijacked the forum, and forced out actual MGTOWS https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW2/comments/9ghyu4/i_just_got_banned_abruptly_from_mgtow/

"Ok so story time:
Oddly enough it was also back in 2016 when I was dumped by my 1st bf at the time  we were dating for around 3 months before I got dumped. His reason was supposedly his dad went into remission and was recently ""laid off"" shortly after the news of his dad's health. He said it was too much to deal with at the time and couldn't deal with a relationship and my naive dumbass gave him the benefit of the doubt. This was like a week before Halloween and he came back asking for me like 2 weeks later and my dumbass took him back only to ghost me 3 weeks later...by that time I have had enough and forgot about him. Fast forward to March of 2017 this scrub had the audacity to text me to see what's up why I didn't come by his house to see what was going on. His excuse this time was that his phone got stolen by a friend of his and had to take them to court to get it back and thats why he didn't call or text for the last 4 months i had a screen shot but have long ago deleted it.  It was pathetic to say the least. So after replying with a ironic WHO DIS?

"Oh god this fucking community...

So. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôve never found a teacher attractive (the english lector at our school is really cute) and honestly, I have thing for teachers. But, would I ever consider dating one, while I‚Äôm still in high school? Hell no. That‚Äôs wrong.

Also, a teacher who goes out with a student is probably not a normal person. Although there are times, when there‚Äôs just regular attraction between two people, who just happen to be a student and their teacher. I personally think it‚Äôs not so bad if the student is 18 or over and the teacher just likes them as a person and they wait until the student graduates and then start a relationship. What is wrong is when the student is younger and the teacher likes them BECAUSE they‚Äôre a student and really young and takes advantage of them.

Lil story: a girlfriend of mine has a classmate, who‚Äôs dating a teacher from a different school in our city. The girl 17 at least, 19 at most. And the teacher? 27. My biggest problem with this is 1. He‚Äôs trying to coerce her into having sex with him and if she won‚Äôt then he‚Äôll break up with her 2. He‚Äôs flirting with other school girls and asking them out on dates. Now, these are all alleged, I heard all of this from two female friends and they could be lying.

"Incels make me sick with their; ""every one should suffer like I suffer."" SERIOUSLY FUCK YOU! WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRULY SUFFERING IN THIS LIFE AND ARE NOT BEING WHINY BITCHES LIKE YOU ARE! 

I had a traumatic head injury while I was working as a Community Support Worker (I helped teach people with mental disabilities how to live, oh and I had to get a BA to get this job) and after suffering with really bad post concussion syndrome for a year it developed into chronic pain syndrome (meaning I am in debilitating pain all day, every day, for the rest of my life) that will never be cured.
 When I say debilitating, I mean I am physically disabled and unable to work anymore because without strong painkillers it hurts to breathe; I literally can't eat or sleep if I don't take my medication. Also, I am genetically resistant to painkillers and CAN'T get high from any opioid pain medication. 

I also have to forever carefully monitor my medication because I already almost died from Serotonin Syndrome because one of the pain clinic doctors was not paying close enough attention to my doses of SSRIs and prescribed me an overdose (PS: I almost died because the fucking paramedic thought I was lying about going through Serotonin Syndrome due to a pain clinics mistake and I was just tripping on E. The RN also believed the paramedics, so I was lying for 6 hours slowly dying as my body was cooking itself from over heating. I was hallucinating, stuttering, confused, in horrible pain and it was all I could do to just keep repeating, ""serotonin syndrome, please give benzodiazepine."" (Benzodiazepines counteract Serotonin syndrome) I was just about to start seizuring or go into cardiac arrest when my Dad finally got into someone's face and forced them to call my Family Doctor to vouche for my story when my Dad realized they were refusing to help because they thought I was doing recreational drugs). 

Worst part about chronic pain conditions is that even if your Family Doctor vouches verbally over the phone and gives you signed paperwork of your condition and how they want other Doctors to treat you if you have to go to the hospital for too much pain, some Doctors will refuse to treat you because they think you might be an addict. The will also block you from getting a second opinion at that hospital unless you are willing to wait an extra 12 hours (after you have already waited 18 hours) for the next shift of Doctors to come on to give their second opinion.

Just to let you know, asshole drug addicts or cunt prescription sellers are clogging up the system with their illegitimate painkiller claims. They are the reason why people with legitimate pain are suffering and having to jump through multiple legal hoops and are forced to be closely monitored on their usage of pain medication you need to survive each day.

So yeah, incels please tell me how much YOUR life sucks because people won't sleep with you because you are too ugly. It's not like the reason you are undateable is because you: don't have a job, lack proper hygiene, or refuse to improve yourself in any way, shape, or form in order to become attractive to the female gender.

How about you whiny, little cunts stop feeling sorry for yourself and be glad you don't have debilitating injuries or physical conditions! Or why don't you be fucking thankful that you are for the most part healthy and able to change your way of living if you want! 

People who think that hurting or killing others is justifiable because they are ""suffering"" are nothing more than scum that deserve to never have sex or reproduce!

Throwing rape around to liken things to it is desensitizing the word, and by doing that people are making others think it's trivial when it's not. Rape victims aren't believed on a daily basis and are laughed at constantly, rape victims have to deal with a lifetime of thoughts and stigma, rape victims are the ones with the nightmares and the ones who have had their own goddamn power stripped away from them in a way that someone cannot truly understand until it has happened to them.

"I have a FUNNY and WEIRD STORY! Both of my parents are teachers and I actually went to the high school my Dad taught at as a Math teacher (never had him as a teacher, but instead of using a locker I stored stuff in my Dad's classroom and would regularly visit him). Since my parents are teachers I NEVER understood Teacher Crushes and was flat out disgusted with the idea. When I found out a classmate was sleeping with one of the coaches I talked to her in private and tried to hear her story and try to convince her to stop and/or report the teacher for misconduct if he was forcing her (For her own, the teacher's, and the teacher's young family's sake). This is how the conversation went:

Me: Hey ACB I heard you were sleeping with Mr. T and I really think for everyone's sake you should stop. And if he is forcing or coercing you to have sex with him please tell your parents and the Principal.

ACB: Whoa, this coming from you? How about you not be such a hypocrite?

Me:... What the hell are you talking about?

ACB: Hello! You are all over Mr. M; touching & hugging him, kissing his cheek, rubbing his shoulders! I've seen you get rides from him after school! You haven't even been in any of Mr. M's classes, so you are clearly sleeping with him because you want to. I have even heard you call him Daddy when you think no one can hear you two! I can't believe no one hasn't reported you and Mr. M for your behaviour! Plus Mr. T is 5 years younger than the teacher you are hanging off of and way hotter! You have no room to talk, so mind your own business!

Me:... What's my last name ACB?

ACB: I don't know. Doesn't start with the letter m?

Me: It's M, and Mr. M is my fucking Dad! Of course I can touch and be affectionate with my Dad! We go home together every day! My 5 year old baby pictures are on his fucking desk and of course I call him Daddy when I don't think anyone can hear me! You are literally sleeping with a colleague of my Dad's, a man your own Father's age!

ACB: (Freezes for a full 30 seconds)... Actually that makes a lot more sense... but how was I supposed to know he was your Dad! You don't even look like him!

Me: Yeah, because my Dad is white and my Mom is Hispanic; I clearly take after my Mom!

ACB: (Suddenly started to laugh and giggle) I can't believe I just accused you of sleeping with your Dad! Oh, wow that makes more sense. I don't think I've ever even heard of you dating anyone,  so I thought it was crazy that you would just start sleeping with an old guy for no benefit.

Me: (sighed heavily) Who else thinks I'm sleeping with my Dad?

ACB: Eh, like a quarter of our grade that came over from Middle School; mostly the girls in our grade that have Mr. M for Math. Don't worry, I'll spread the real truth now.

Me: Thanks, but seriously give my advice some thought. I'm just really concerned for you and Mr. T is a real douche-bag and a whore. I'm really don't want you to regret what you are doing later.

ACB: Yeah, yeah! I better go tell some classmates that Mr. M is your Dad. Some of the girls were thinking of seducing him for better grades since he seemed to respond so well to you.

Me: WHAT?!

Don't worry none of the girls had tried to seduce my Dad, I guess they were just joking with ACB. 
But seriously, KIDS STOP TRYING TO SEDUCE YOUR TEACHERS! THEY USUALLY ARE MARRIED, HAVE FAMILIES, AND ARE NOT INTERESTED IN GETTING WITH A CHILD! YOU JUST MAKE THEM REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE (both the male AND female teachers). PLEASE REPORT ANY TEACHER THAT ACTS INAPPROPRIATE WITH YOU OR TOUCHES YOU IN A FLIRTATIOUS MANNER!

It wasn't. It felt oppressive. There is something inherently degrading about being in a relationship, sexual or otherwise, with a person who has or has previously held seniority over you. It's inherently predatory, regardless of whether you are consenting or not. 

I am currently studying to be a high school teacher. We are repeatedly reminded of ethical relationships with students, conflicts of interest, and professional boundaries regarding our students.

"I can't stand when people think that feminism means misandry (man-hating) (not directed at the youtuber) because misandry is just women supremacy and that's just as bad as men being considered superior to women. It's saying that one gender is superior to the other either way and flipping it around doesn't make it right. Feminism is simply the belief in equality of the genders, misandry completely contradicts that and does not progress at all from misogyny or sexism. Obviously, misandry is not ok but it is not as serious an issue in society as sexism which is much more common and severe. Men still have more  privilege than women and are not considered less than women for the most part.",0,0,2018-09-17T04:36:38.000Z,Alicia Westmacott,UCOJHKrct7DYBsGCQNIH5YXA,9RuXrlASic0,True,UgyP2KnLAzchOAB5_yB4AaABAg

"OH GOD I LOOKED IT UP AND THE FIRST POST IS ABOUT THIS VIDEO
this is entirely too meta and I cannot discern how I feel about this inception situation
okay, reading this though, there are points made by these kids that I agree with. 

I think showing their usernames is not a great idea (obvs you would have to switch up the screen recording to black out names but I think privacy, esp for minors, is good - and there are a lot of people who are going and hating on them which is unacceptable). 

there are, ofc, some of them just plain hating on you, which I in general don't agree with but the fact does remain that the intentions with which most people viewing this content came here, and the intentions with which you made it, are to cringe at it and...I see that it's close to line on cyberbullying, because of the hate being sent at people, even if you don't mean it to be cruel. your channel is pretty popular and thus a LOT of people saw this, but the posts are basically their diaries about either their teen crushes or just...crushes that involve teachers. numerous people commented that ""what she showed isn't what the tcc is"" but as I have no experience with it, I don't know what it IS about. 

more than a lot of your videos, I do feel really...cringey and uncomfortable about not just the content but the broadcasting of it. I know it's one of the things Tumblr's gotten a bad rap for, but this generally is a community of kids (and young adults) and people get really cringey and awkward and overinvested in things that they later realize aren't...great. but especially as a teenager, it's pretty common to have crushes on unattainable people, and to want someone who can help you mature and become an adult and feel stable, and I think that's where a lot of this comes from, idk. there are certainly problems in the first place with treating tumblr like a diary, but especially for people who are talking about things dear to their hearts, maybe we should...not shove that out onto another public platform.",0,0,2018-09-17T03:13:55.000Z,E.J.

"I personally think that having a crush on a teacher isn‚Äôt wrong, it‚Äôs when you fantasize and sexualize it gets wrong. When kids think that their teachers like them back it is ridiculous. Teenagers who obsess over their teacher is wrong. Having a slight crush on a teacher is nothing wrong, but when you want to have a relationship and want to sexualize your relationship is disgusting. You should know that your crush is going nowhere and your teacher views you as a student and nothing more. As long as you know that nothing is going to happen and keep it as a crush it‚Äôs okay. Keep your relationship professional, because teachers are getting paid to teach you, not fill your fantasies.",1,0,2018-09-17T01:36:08.000Z,I‚Äôve got the Tae With Suga Kookies,UCqwMXpuolXCvV-4O1Pn1vkg,RgyROYtnWtk,True,UgyW3gdQnhbgthrWfR94AaABAg

Its funny that you said you thought you had a pinched nerve because the exact same thing happened to me in May and I called an ambulance and they told me it was just a pinched nerve.

EDIT: Also your left lung collapsing again after the chest tube is also the same! Except that I was getting ready to leave the hospital so they did one last xray before I left came back to me with my packed bags and were like 'you can't go home today you need surgery you need to stay here one more week' Nightmare.

EDIT: Sorry I'm typing as I watch. Holy crap! Your story about getting the chest tubes in are terrifying. I'm so glad this happened to me in Japan.

"In psychology, pedophilia is often times referred to as a sort of mental illness. It‚Äôs similar to someone who suffers from violent intrusive thoughts, like those with bpd or schizophrenia, only their violent thoughts are of a different nature: sexual violence towards children. 
Peophiles often times were victims of pedophilia themselves, and because of the abuse that took place during a crucial psychological developmental period of their life, their sexual development and psyche is traumatized, thus resulting in them becoming a pediphile themselves. A lot of pedopholes are aware of this, and strive to get help to cope with what happened to them so that they may diminish the intrusive thoughts. Many pedophiles also are nonoffending, and I mean truly nonoffending where they completely separate themselves from children in any capacity possible; social, online, etc.

"Okay, so I think that having a simple crush on your teacher is fine. Sue me. I mean, most of these people are still pretty young (schooling age, duh) and impressional, so duh, why wouldn't they at least feel some sort of affection for their teachers? Hell, when I was in junior high I had a crush on my teacher (brieftly, don't eat my ass). They were kind to me and always helped me when I asked for it, so obviously I grew attracted to them. I didn't act on it, and out relationship stayed pretty  much the same throughout the whole period (it was only for a few weeks, it faded).

The only this I find wrong about TCs is when the kids (and/or teachers) act on it. That's the illegal part. These children thinking they are in love with their teachers is wrong, and gross, especially when they start flirting with them. That's disgusting. The only type of teacher love that is acceptable is when the person is in college and it's a consesual relationship that doesn't start a bias.

"In my experience there are two different kinds of MGTOWs. First are the older ones. These generally went through one or two divorces and either received a very raw deal or had to fight for custody of their children. I personally know a few men like this. I can sympathize with them. No, not every woman would do something like that, but every women could. This is one area in society where men are explicitly disadvantaged to women's benefit. They are victims here, and it makes just as much sense as a female rape victim who avoids men.

Then there are the younger ones. These generally suffer from social anxiety, or something similar. They struggle forming relationships and project their anger on women. I feel kind of bad for them. Hell, as a man in his twenties who is extremely shy has yet to have a first kiss, it sucks. I'm not gonna lie. But turning your own personal struggles into hatred against women is where my sympathy runs dry. You aren't single because of your looks, or even your personality, because men who are unattractive and have shitty personalities can and do end up in relationships. You are single because you are emotionally incompetent. These kind of guys really just need to stay away from each other.

"Funny story.

My bfs not a teacher but he‚Äôs viewed as something similar as he watches kids and does life guidance for them through a program.

At the time of this story he was 23 I believe. (I‚Äôm also 23 if anyone thinks I‚Äôm like some kid bc I look young just fyi)

Anyway, this 12 year old girl at his work said she was really into the DDLG thing, and this was when he was going through a phase where he had a big beard and slicked his hair back and looked well beyond 23. She told another girl she essentially had a crush on him. He was told by his superior to not ruin the connection in case she was being abused right.

Anyway, girl constantly tries to force her fetish on him by trying to get him to hold her hand, help her tie her shoes, etc. if she was a mentally challenged kid, which he works with, he would have helped but he just told her to stop acting like a child.

One day, in an attempt to ‚Äúimpress‚Äù him she told him she was dating a 27 year old man and he was her ‚Äúdaddy.‚Äù

Well, it backfired because he had to report it. She never was actually dating a 27 year old man, and she no longer talks to my boyfriend. I don‚Äôt think she even goes there anymore. LOLOLOL

"I never really have any teacher crush until I'm almost 20 and it's freaking me out. My teacher was super sweet too and supportive af and it scares me even more because he's going super close too (he even bought me an expensive watercolour kit when I did super well on my final year project! I'm touched but why only me since he has other students too!) The situation was super awkward because he too was shy around me and trying to raise conversations with me whenever we met. Like ""How was your day? Are you feeling alright?"" All soft and lovey (I swooned but I was scared BUT I also try to think he's just being nice--) also he always spills his story to me, about his life, his likes, interests what he hates. 

I have the right to be scared. I do my final year project solo. Unlike others who find people to help them. I'm comfy alone. And he was assigned as my supervisor (as to a few more others). And this conversations tend to happen when we are alone and with him supervising my overall work. I know nothing bad will happen but I couldn't help but worry cause he's a married m a n. I do NOT want to be the cause of someone's well established relationship, married, with adorable kids, to fall! I'd rather swallow my stupid crush down than to act on it!

To make things worse our age gaps aren't exactly that huge too.

"The whole getting married -thing is becoming less and less of a thing but I must admit I did take some offense when you said that it is a reality that people are becoming disillusioned with the idea of relationships with the opposite sex. That is not true. 
I think what we are seeing is the result of  first world comfort paving the way for self discovery. People choose to have children late in life and only a few so that they have the time to give them the attention they want, because in today's world we perceive childhood as sacred.
Having a lot of children when you're young is not exactly a recipe for a stable homelife and it is not something people want for their kids if they can choose.
In poor countries they don't have the luxury of choosing most things. Survival is first priority and that means working hard at shite jobs with shite hours and shite pay and having a lot of kids because contraception isn't a thing and most people die young which means that you need to have many kids to make sure at least some of them survive to adulthood. 
In the western world we have medicin and we grow older and older and our death rate for children is extremely low so we don't feel the urge to have a lot of children. 
The way MGTOW and third wave feminists decide to interpret the current state of the western world is in my opinion a complete misreading of a completely natural occurrence that happens when humans are given a big enough safety net to go out and live their lives instead of going out just to survive it.",0,0,2018-09-16T14:15:46.000Z,silja lin,UCTzFGKYLzERyBlMoBWcLYKg,P0yqcKjRTtc,True,UgzswZwIJWqh71wxxSJ4AaABAg

"One thing that really annoys me is that so many people act like it's mean to explain to these teenagers and CHILDREN that it is a crime for their feelings to be reciprocated. I get that the crushes would probably develop either way, but people acting like it's cute and wholesome for these young children to want to be in a relationship with their teacher, and for some of them to act on it or want something romantic or sexual to /actually happen/ between them is just gross. Teenagers aren't stupid, and they don't need to be treated like glass - explain that if their teacher actually tried anything romantic or sexual with them they could (and SHOULD) be arrested. Tell them that if an adult - whether they like the adult or not - tries to touch them or instigate anything romantic or sexual with them, it is wrong, and they should tell their parents or another adult.

Also, stop promoting this sort of thing in popular media - that will just spread and normalize it! I can't get over this one episode of New Girl when a young girl (I think she was meant to be 13 or 14) had a crush on Nick (a grown man) and when it was discovered, instead of explaining why he couldn't like her like that, Nick was forced to apologise to this girl because they felt bad for her and didn't want to destroy her fantasy. There's also an episode of Modern Family when one of the kids (who was literally like 5) develops a crush on Claire (again, a fully-grown, 40-something-year-old woman) and tried to seduce her by playing music, offering her drinks, using pickup lines and flirting etc. and that one grossed me out for so many reasons - he's literally a TODDLER, and he was made to seduce a 48-year-old woman in ways that, had he been old enough to even know what he was doing, would have been construed as sexual. It's just gross, real or fictional.",0,0,2018-09-16T09:19:16.000Z,QuirksOfTay,UCq9HvL0bp1QB-Oobqll9ngw,RgyROYtnWtk,True,Ugw-3Sf1WzFhdRtC34h4AaABAg

"Innocent teacher crushes were the teen admires the teacher from afar and grows out of it eventually are perfectly fine in my opinion, I've seen an infinite amount of girls do this. However where it stops being okay is when it is acted upon. I didn't personally witness this, but I was told by an old classmate that back when we were in school, one of our teachers slept with a student as soon as said student had turned 18. And of course, at university, a fuck ton of girls slept with their professors and two of said professors even left their wives for students 25+ years younger than them - but that's different imo since every involved person is an adult and in that case, the older party didn't see the younger party grow up.

"I am a lesbian. My girl is bi who just so happens to prefer girls but had way more luck with guys in her youth.
My point?

I BEAT EVERYONE! I know I shouldn't see my lady as a trophy or a prize to be won, but holy fuck! She is a  treasure hidden among all these polished turds trying to pass themselves off as precious gems. (I don't like people. I am such an introvert. It's a miracle I found anybody.)

How did I achieve such a dazzling beauty that, no exaggeration, many fall head over heels for? 
Confidence, humor and no jealousy. I make her laugh every fucking minute of the day because I live for it.  Many people have come up to me and often ask me ""Why is *she* with *you* ?"" And ""If you die, I am going to be all over that."" ...I wish I was lying. Yet this doesn't scare me off. I actually take such pride that she chose me over men and women that have tried and failed to win her over. 
I even asked her why me over everyone else? ""Confidence matters."" 

My lady, for the most part, never experienced this bi prejudice. Her being bi never even comes up in our relationship. I am with her and she is with me, it's as simple as that. If someone ever came up to my girlfriend and gave her such bisexual retaliation my response would be ""They're just upset they didn't win your heart first."" Because I know it's true. And then she rolls her eyes because it's cheesy as hell but that's how I roll. 

Side note, she is more feminine than I am.... learn something new every day.",0,2,2018-09-16T04:00:54.000Z,supersaiandemon,UCJl8oysmz37nX2i-bN0x3CQ,vD0iKik363U,True,UgwOBpOmKM2IYp8b-Pt4AaABAg

"[I mention rape so if you are sensitive to that be aware] I'll admit, there are crappy women out there. There also crappy men though. Women should not serve only for sex and care for the family because they will get tired of that and find no reason to do well at that and then the man would be stuck in that relationship or else he would be a hypocrite because they were complaining about women divorcing. Does that sound ideal? Also I would like to know what gave men this role or providing finances? I'd love to know (without religion) what decided to give this power to men and why did that matter more than the issues of women. I understand that women can be hurtful and cruel. It happens but I don't think because one man rapes a women that all men will. Women are usually more emotional and require an emotional bond. Marriage has always been something I wanted but I want to be careful with marriage. I will never marry someone who would force me to be a stay at home mom. That is not who I am and if you don't like who I am then I can't build a bond and will never wish to marry you. Sometimes girls don't like you.

"having a crush on a teacher is not an uncommon thing, but problems arise when there are literal children who have fantasies like this. not only could a situation like the ones that they fantasize about be illegal or something along those lines, it's something that is just morally wrong. personally, i am someone that had a crush on a teacher while i was in high school, and regardless of whether or not it's a small age gap or something that is consented to it's just wrong. a student may be above the age of consent, but when someone is in a position of power like that, especially if they're idealized by the student like many of the people who are part of the teacher crush community, it opens the door for an unhealthy and possibly abusive relationship. not to mention the fact that in most (if not all) american schools, a teacher is not allowed to have a relationship with a student. often times, these issues are taken very seriously. it's not cool to try and do something that could RUIN SOMEONE'S CAREER AND LIVELIHOOD just because of a little schoolgirl fantasy. a little crush is harmless, but when kids take things to this extreme it's honestly just worrying and a bit sickening tbh. sorry for ranting oop",0,0,2018-09-16T03:34:15.000Z,lorenzo valla,UCqUwEHavZei2l4A0qnA_aMA,RgyROYtnWtk,True,UgxBgy5kXBUThgHHz_94AaABAg

""The first time I heard that label, I thought it was incredibly inane. That word doesn't mean anything; it's just a vague derogatory term against anyone more liberal than you. I'm just gay""
YOU FEWEL! That was a reasonable answer! Everyone knows if you're not an SJW, you will mindlessly chant ""Feminism is cancer"" in reply! So you ARE an SJW!





Also to set the record straight, Leftnet wasn't calling Pewdiepie a Nazi because we thought he was too conservative. We were calling him a Nazi because he paid some people to hold up a sign that said ""Death to Jews"". Yes it was obviously a prank - I'm sorry,    ""S O C I A L   E X P E R I M E N T"" - and I don't think anyone literally believed he had become a white supremacist. But hopefully we can all agree that what he did was at least NAZI ADJACENT, and since true believers already veil their agenda by claiming they're being Nazis ""IRONICALLY""... the fact that it was just to see how people would react doesn't really cut it as an excuse.",1,0,2018-09-16T02:17:32.000Z,Heather Calun,UCogQkiqJuigZ8EODsJ3q2tA,a06OFh4Wl8o,True,UgxeYNEoHfM5gfK0Sv54AaABAg
"Hi! So at one point in the vid you said something about asking how tarot cards + anonymous asks could work so I‚Äôll try my best to explain ig? Tarot card readings are based around the idea of spirits telling the reader the ‚Äòanswers‚Äô through cards. As the reader shuffles their deck, certain cards will go flying out in specific orders as they shuffle and they are placed in positions according to the order they flew. There are different types of readings that involve different positions and I only know about the nine card readings, but it works with anonymous people because the ‚Äòspirits‚Äô are guiding the cards and will give the answers to the person‚Äôs problem. I once witnessed someone doing a reading for their friend and then leaving the friend‚Äôs results on their voicemail and it was really cool! I‚Äôm kind of on the edge of believing and not believing in tarot cards, but I definitely enjoy doing what you do which is just learning about them and I definitely recommend just trying an in person reading with someone if you want to learn more. Usually they‚Äôre really chill when you ask questions about what they‚Äôre doing or what the nine positions mean, and it‚Äôs really fun to learn about! (Ps I love your videos, they‚Äôre so awesome)",0,0,2018-09-16T02:16:39.000Z,Skylar Layne,UCwC15ht0oyXdwYRHGRq4Wvg,8GP2EfVP24Y,True,UgxxVytxuAMYolaSkot4AaABAg

"You are a bully and a cunt. Fuck you. Like these people don't choose to like their teachers, most don't search for the ""hot teachers."" in most cases, it just happens and one day they just realize, ""Holy shit i think i love them."" they make blogs on tumblr as an outlet, as somewhere to safely talk about their feelings that most KNOW THEY CAN'T ACT ON. And for you to talk shit and literally bully people who already feel bad for their feelings... you are horrible. Like yes an adult preying on a minor is rightfully illegal, and obviously wrong. All of the instances (which are rarely on tumblr in the first place) where students actually get with their teachers before they are 18 and before they graduate is wrong. The majority of people with tc blogs AGREE with this and advise everyone to be safe and wise with how they interact with their tc.

Like, I‚Äôm just friends with teachers. That‚Äôs it.

*WARNING!! TANGENT UP AHEAD*
If I ever do have a crush on someone (never a teacher), I always push my feelings aside and force myself to get over it because I‚Äôm only 14, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready for dating at all. I‚Äôm not even sure if I have a crush on this guy. For all I know, we could just be close because we sat together for a couple years at lunch and free period, so I happened to talk to him more than the others in our friend circle. He‚Äôs known the others for longer, so of course he thinks of me as simply one of the others, whereas I lost touch with the others in our group after 5th grade. And how do you even go about acting on a crush, anyway?? It can‚Äôt be as simple as ‚Äúhey, want to go out with me‚Äù, right!? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to date until I‚Äôm in college. Besides, the person in question currently has a girlfriend, and I‚Äôm happy for him, despite being that person who still watches movies like ‚ÄúEnchanted‚Äù and half-wishes that were reality. Not only would true love be more obvious, but I could easily start up a musical number in real life! How cool would that be? I‚Äôve always wanted to do that...
Oh... *ahem*, but I‚Äôm going off on a tangent.
Anyway, I never really understood all this stuff surrounding crushes in the first place. All the inappropriate stuff that people say regarding relationships and stuff...I just don‚Äôt get it. Almost 15, and I still think it‚Äôs disgusting. I just know that when I was around this guy last year, and had no one else to sit with during free period, seeing him would bring a smile to my face, even if I was having a terrible day and he just played on his phone the whole time anyway. We had a lot of fun conversations, and found out we actually liked a lot of the same stuff, and just never realized. But I think I‚Äôll get over all of this soon. I don‚Äôt really have a choice.

"used to have a crush on two of my science teachers, at 12, and at 17. i never acted on them, and they were mainly puppy crushes/thinking the teacher was really cute and nice. most i'd do was basically be a teacher's pet and befriend them. both have faded, and both have gone more toward ""they touched my heart and made me feel like kindness existed when i was super hopeless and depressed"" than anything else. 
first crush was in 7th grade, and i never even realized i'd crushed on him until after it faded and after i began mourning his passing(he'd died in a car crash after i transferred schools). he was the initial reason i appreciate the german language, and i still kind of hold our old conversations dear to me, since he helped me try and get better at my drawings, and after my initial trauma that school year(which garnered me ptsd), he'd let me just kind of follow him around since he was the teacher i was most comfortable around. i'm surprised he didn't realize himself and kindly ask me to understand boundaries, but as an autistic kid i never really grasped them regardless of my emotions toward a person.
second(and last) teacher crush was on my biology teacher from my junior year, this sweet, young, and beautiful korean woman who would always speak in a timid voice and had a large amount of care to the future of all of her students. i tended to get defensive over her(as i had with other teachers previously who i became teacher pets for) to students who bashed her, and i would try and help her out the best i could. hell, when i had a study hall period i became a teacher assistant for her during that class(as i was a straight a student, i never really needed to study and the class would have been useless anyways), which is also when her biggest and rowdiest class was. i'd do my classwork for my class with her(a lunch period after the one i would assist her with) and simultaneously help out students who needed it, to the point the entire class and my own class kind of would only listen to me when substitutes were around(which is bad, but i was also the oldest in the class as i transferred schools and needed to catch up on old credits, so i was the closest to an actual teacher assistant they got) and the teacher assistant status never really faded after i would go back to my own class. i'd still sit at her desk while she worked at the board, i'd still help her with powerpoints, setting timers, all that, and i'd even help her grade papers. i wasn't allowed to grade my own, due to fear of bias even if i am an honest boyo, and we'd sit and talk at lunch since i usually sat alone and enjoyed her friendly company while we watched the halls. she's a sweet teacher, and my senior year she even gifted me art pens since she knew i loved to draw, and she appreciated me helping her with her classes the previous year so much. she's moved out of state, now, but i hope she's doing well, and i hope she finally is getting peace from the bs of my highschool and all the kids who would hate a teacher simply because they enforced rules. üôÉ
ps side story: same high school, we got a new young theatre teacher, and every single fuckin freshman and sophmore(aka 14-16 year olds) loved him and would actually call him hot, sexy, gorgeous, and all that TO HIS FACE! and before it got out his girlfriend was a well-loved science teacher in the school, everyone was saying shit like ""oh when i turn 18 i'm gonna pin him down and make him mine and he won't have to worry about his girlfriend"" like uHM??? NO STOP THATS REAL BAD NEVER DO THAT
moral of the story: small puppy love crushes on teachers are okay so long as you know they're way older and will not love you back unless they belong in a jail cell instead of a classroom, and you don't act on it/discuss literal sexual assault on a teacher bc you think they're attractive. smh teachers don't get paid enough to deal w kids like that.",0,0,2018-09-15T22:38:11.000Z,Eli S.,UCIrP8CA-dVIzDLWqZ-xX1Gg,RgyROYtnWtk,True,UgxX5Tu3WwPujNefR8R4AaABAg

"i say teacher crushes are fine, as long as neither the student or teacher acts upon it. you should never confess your love to your teacher. imagine how theyd feel, they probably have a fucking family and they just want to teach you and stuff. personally ive never had a teacher crush, i have/had a teacher ""friend(s)"" but its literally just us talking casually and them helping me with my work as well as just life problems. but id never think of doing anything with them, and id hope they never thought of doing anything with me. like yeah i love them, but not in that way, i love them as people and just their personality, id never ever think of being in a relationship with them and especially doing anything sexual with them, it just completely cringes me out and makes me uncomfortable.

people who have teacher crushes:

do NOT act on it ever, they will never love you and if they do, stop talking to them completely and report them (if youre under the age of 16-18) because quite clearly theres something wrong with them and they need help. teacher crushes are normal, theyre just like a regular crush on a celebrity or some random person you saw in public, but you cannot act on your crush ever itll cause issues for both you and them.

people who have student crushes:

first of, its wrong. do not act on it, you will get done for pedophilia (if the student is under 16-18), you need to stop its wrong to have any sexual or romantic connections with your students.",1,0,2018-09-15T19:54:07.000Z,Alicja Pankowska,UCNpywwI4S6a1XpxVunisqUA,RgyROYtnWtk,True,Ugx9FWeYA5gBPVyEHkB4AaABAg

"Good video. I think everyone has got a crush, but this thing like stalking and wanting to know everything about your TEACHER is so unhealthy. At 6:43 there's this question ""what's his family status? Any kids?"" To me, this question represents this TCC so well, I'm speechless right now. Like I know how it is to be attracted to older men, but not that old and not with CHILDREN that are maybe the same age or even younger like me (and at least I'm not 13). And please think of the teachers too: If you have got a crush, you may interpret things very wrong. I don't think your teacher loves you just because he's always giving you attention... (""Kaylie, please stop! Are you taking photos of me? In class? What the fuck, Kaylie?"" 'OMG he must love me, he said my name TWICE OMG OMG OMG! Have to write a tumblr blog about this')

Like i have this english teacher that is just so nice to everyone and got really exited when we started studying Macbeth and i thought it was cute. In a sea of teachers that definitely don' give two fucks about making the lesson enjoyable he's a breath of fresh air that brightens my day a bit. But i would never think of him as more than a teacher i happen to like more than others, and in no way will i think of sucking his dick or something that's just incredibly gross

"My high school psychology teacher started dating one of my classmates immediately after she graduated (he was fired for transphobic rhetoric later on because he got in a fight with a student, so no worries about him continuing to flirt with students). He gave her special treatment in class sometimes and no one really knew why. I think most of us just figured he was a caring teacher because she had a lot of mental health issues. No one's supposed to know about their relationship, she doesn't have him in a single photo on social media despite the fact that they're living together. I only know all of this because of a mutual friend.
I think when they officially started dating she was 18 and he was somewhere around 35.

"I can understand where some of these guys are coming from; NOT because I agree with them, but because I've been through relationships like some of them describe. The issue, I believe, with the disillusionment of modern individuals toward serious long-term committed relationships (marriage in particular) is due to the trend of refusing responsibility. You can see it in a lot of cry-bullies and extreme SJW's who demand that EVERYONE ELSE needs to change so that they, the offending individual, doesn't get hurt or offended. You can see it in both MRA's and radical feminists, where they blame one another for all the problems of their side, but neither is willing to give an inch regarding their own responsibilities to either side.

It all comes down to personal responsibility and maturity. Many of the MRA's and misandrists are bitter because they are angry at what someone of the opposite sex did to them. They see no fault in themselves, nor accept that their own failures may be to blame for relationships ending, resentment, etc. 

We can only change ourselves. No amount of rambling and raging and blaming will ever make another person change. The only way to escape the pit these people find themselves in is by looking in the mirror. Accept that what you see isn't perfect, and that you make plenty of mistakes yourself. Accept that you cannot expect from others that which you do not possess yourself. Grow up, make changes as you need them. You will find happiness and gratification in your relationship when you possess the traits and personal qualities you want in a partner. It all begins with accepting our place, our responsibilities, and changing for the better the only person you can truly change: Yourself.",0,0,2018-09-15T06:29:27.000Z,David Wells,UCtL0xLsQMQ4HEopl_T0EJmw,P0yqcKjRTtc,True,UgznRNMcjMfFhbYU3-B4AaABAg

"The thing is, the biphobia in gay people stems from a mindset i like to call the ""one of us"" mindset (not like in a cult, please don't get the wrong idea, I am NOT comparing bi people to a cult!). There are parts of the LGBT community that hate straight people so bad, they shun bi peeps for being ""half straight"" and ""siding with the enemy"". Just like there's the darker side of feminism that's calling for male genocide, or the darker side of the trans community that calls for a cis genocide (both I have seen on tumblr). As a gay guy, it sickens me that we are still not getting along, and for the simple reason of some people liking the opposite sex at all. 

Here are the worst excuses some gay people use to justify their I ever heard of (none of these are made up, I found many of these on tumblr a few months back. Keep in mind these are mildly paraphrased, as I don't remember the exact sentences):

""I can't trust Bi people. They are 50% more likely to cheat because their options are bigger.""

""They date the enemy. They are siding with the people that hold us down.""

""They might have diseases that they picked up from the other side""

And that's just on one long rant post I saw. There were 20 more assholish posts like this, and all with the same one argument: ""straight people are the enemy, and yall are siding with them"".

We need to put a stop to this needless hate.

"I have really liked one of my teachers.
Not in a sexual manner though. 
In middle school I was constantly reminded that high schools were different and the teachers wouldn‚Äôt care or chase after us as much. Which was somewhat true. Just not as extreme as they made it out to be. 
But in grade ten I had one teacher who stood out from the others. Because he cared but also because he was everything I wished and wanted my dad to be. Which was a good respectable role model, kind, considerate, smart and a good sense of humour. 
His wife who was another teacher was very similar too.

I got really attached to him. Also doing an extracurricular activity along which he had organized. When I came into the 11th grade and realized I wasn‚Äôt able to be his student. I cried. Because I truly missed having him as a teacher and male role model. 
I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs weird. For some reason I feel it‚Äôs more normal to fantasize about a teacher having an affair with you than you being part of their family or one of their daughters.
Because I‚Äôm not sure how to describe what I felt. It was a longing mixed with admiration and affection.  I longed to a father who was like him, admired his passion for his career and science and felt an affection for him. Like I hadn‚Äôt with other teachers.

So wrong on so many levels! All of my teachers were married! Some younger teachers that subbed once in a while, and were just starting their careers, were really awesome people to connect with, but anything more? No!

I did experience plenty of guys talking about female teachers in ways that should never be said about any woman. Teenagned hormones need to be put to better use for the good of us all.

But I thought I should talk about adult age-gap relationships to give people a realistic perspective! I am 20 and my girlfriend is 40 (we are both women). I think age gap relationships really depend on the mannerisms of the people. We are on similiar emotional levels, we are both adults doing adult things (job/career wise, lmao)but not compromising fun and enjoyment for the sake of acting like a super serious adult kind of thing. We love animated movies and gaming (: ! We also have had many similiar experiences not many people I've met understand. Adult age-gap relationships can be healthy as long as there are two consenting adults, they treat each other as equals (not as if the older one instantly knows better), there is no advantage taking on either side or any age-related fetishism, and there are similiar ideals and interests between both people!

"I don't know about this. I have and have honestly always had a huge thing for older men and I had crushes on my teachers when I was younger (like as young as 6, not even kidding). I think it's perfectly fine and innocent to have a crush on your teacher and I don't think creating a community around that is too bad of a thing. Obviously it's bad when the teacher reciprocates it though. That's abuse. Also, I don't think age gap relationships are bad at all. The age of consent is 16 where I live so as long as all parties are enthusiastically consenting and are over the age of 16, I don't really care. My parents were 16 and 34 when they got together and they were together for 23 years. It's not all black and white imo and to me, an 18-year-old and a 40-year-old is absolutely fine. I also don't believe that if someone in a position of power is dating someone with less power than them, it's automatically abuse. So if it was like uni/college students and professors and all parties are enthusiastically consenting, I don't really care. Live and let live. If it's within the law, do whatever imo.

EDIT: Thought I should also mention that minors in kink is absolutely disgusting and that, that girl taking part in dd/lg does not represent the BDSM community in any way.

"Ok I'm not even gonna lie, I had tons of crushes on my teachers, even up to this year. It was weird. It is weird. It's normal to have these crushes, yes. But it's weird. And shouldn't be reciprocated. Even if overage. In my opinion at least. And this is coming from me, fresh from leaving this community and not even positive that I fully left. Because the ideas and the obsessions are not healthy at all. Like it's okay if you like someone who is older than you. But not if you are underage number one and not when they are a role model figure. And an obsession isn't healthy period. And honestly, if either of the teachers I had crushes on in high school told me that the feelings were reciprocated I'd be pretty weirded out. I honestly think it was more of a loneliness thing, I found their personality and their appearance attractive so I created this entire picturesque relationship in my head and missed out on a normal friend relationship with some really cool teachers. I got wrapped up in an ultimately weird and creepy community that just validated borderline crazy situations that I would come up with. You see things that aren't there, you over think, you can't learn or speak to your teacher about normal things, it encourages bad things for impressionable teenagers. If you have a crush on your teacher: don't voice it, don't act on it, DO NOT read Tumblr posts about it, I repeat, NO TUMBLR POSTS. Remember it's normal, yes. But do not let it get to obsession level like this community. Realize how outlandish this crush is. Realize that those accounts where these relationships work out are outliers,they are not hope. There is a slim to none chance that anything will happen and if it does, that's probably not a good thing. You can admire someone without obsessing over them and that is exactly the point that this community is missing.

"I've been WAITING for this video as I'm part of the TC & ily <3
I wanted to clear up some shit I've seen in the comments bc like jsjssk it lowkey annoys me lol
I own a semi decently big blog (900 followers n i started in Feb oops) on the tag and I'm mutuals with practically everyone you mentioned jsjsjsk
SO
- Not EVERYONE wants to have reciprocation of their feelings from their TC,, in fact 90% of us preach that you don't make any advances at all, and if you do rEALLY want to then wait a few years after your out of school and have a steady life.
- Blogging about our TC's is more of a coping mechanism then anything really?? I agree that the tag can be toxic (I once got an ask saying that my TC is 110% in love with when 1. that's not okay, 2. he actually HATES me lmao) but it more of a way to relate I guess to others who have feelings like yours, as it is seen to be pretty weird lmao.
- Pretty much all of us don't wish our teachers were pedos so bc that's just fucking sick??
- If you are confused on why someone would crush on their teacher here;
I look at it like having a celebrity crush when young. You can't have them. You never will have them. And they're way older then you. Yet you still fall madly and obsessively in love with them for no reason? I hope you get what I mean lol
- Reason why i personally started my blog, is because these feelings for my teacher were getting a bit overwhelming and telling my friends (which i did and know my whole school + teachers know fuck) made me feel uncomfortable and i knew they'd spill shit so I made my blog as a safe way to cope with them. 

If anyone bothers to read to here feel free to ask me shit as long as you aren't a dick about it :)) 

((Also about the TCC tag thing, there was a bit of a fight i guess lol and Crime got TCC and Teacher got TC))",1,0,2018-09-14T16:12:26.000Z,Urlstan,UC3ADeqmikjkUBsSQ2incDzw,RgyROYtnWtk,True,UgzjQzp2NHT9KXo4ZZt4AaABAg

"Lmao I always feel conflicted about this community, bc my very best friend in High School had a huge crush on my 37 year old teacher for like, 2 years or something. She'd always had a thing for older men, which we'd talked about since she was 14 and even though I thought it was kinda weird, I accepted her for who she was. She wasn't really the type to get hurt or manipulated easily, so I trusted that she knew what she was doing.
Anyway, that teacher ended up leaving school because he was offered a new job and then started a relationship with a 19 year old girl who used to be his student only one year ago, lol. So I guess my friend actually had a shot with him. My friend is now 18, she's in her last year of High School and has a crush on a new teacher, who is still almost 30, but luckily a bit younger than the last teacher. Though she has changed her mind a little bit on age gap relationships, since she went on a date with a 35 year old dude she met on tinder, which didn't go very well, she's still often attracted to older men. She's just realized how odd it is considering what a different stage of life you're in compared to the much older person.
I still support her, I mean, she's made more questionable decisions and I'm not here to tell her what to do. So my overall stance is teacher crushes are fine, teacher-student relationships are ehhh dangerous, I wouldn't advice it, but if you know the risks and it makes you happy, I'm happy for you and I'll keep an eye out for you as a friend.",0,0,2018-09-14T16:05:24.000Z,Jo√´lle Weetjewel,UCZbJoCwNo6_m8S-kITW0_Fg,RgyROYtnWtk,True,UgwgslL7C7T9RA78s414AaABAg

"Ok let me tell y'all a story from my hell high school (I'm Polish so here high school is three years - 16-19 yrs old). So I'm a baby 16, I arrive at this new strange place and we're waiting for our first history class. While we're waiting,one of the girls who was friends with older folks in that school tells us fun new things abt our history teacher, like that he dates and fucks girls who graduated. We're all a little scared but proceed, he turns out to be a pretty good teacher, education-wise. But fast forward two years and bam! two girls from my class, including one of my closest friends at that time are ""IN LOVE!!"" with him. They're not subtle abt it either, my friend is head over heels for him, the other girl invited him to our prom, like openly (there's a tradition of students dancing like this big starting dance with teachers but she was... like an open volunteer for this and more). It's all very weird, like I wasn't at school at the time but rumor goes he was more than ok with such .... advances. Obviously it gets to the headmistress and guess what!! He gets reprimanded and now has to wear ""appropriate"" clothes to classes. That's it. The headmistress thought the problem was entirely in his wear of graphic t-shirts. (There's even more problem with this on my personal side as I reached out to him for help with my depression and self harm since he was so open and close to students and he just... failed.

I think this went on for about 3 months and one day we are all sitting on the floor for assembly and he was standing off to the side and I looked over to him smiling, then he looked over and noticed... and then he winked at me with a secretive kind of smile, ya'know?

"I don't understand why individuality is such a awful thing to them, like it goes above and beyond the usual ""Remember, you owe everything to God, so be a good person and follow these outdated rules."" thing. What's wrong with thinking for yourself and having your own thoughts and ideas? Being shunned because you are a unique, nuanced person instead of being nothing more than a carbon copy of everyone else is so depressing. If everyone was exactly alike, we would never had come up with the science and technologies that changed the world! We probably wouldn't have ever gotten past the stone age either, because sharing new ideas is so important to our species. We thrive because we are different from each other, yet still alike. Diversity truly is a beautiful thing. Religion, or anybody else, shouldn't define who you are. You define who you are. And if it's something you can't choose, like sexuality, race, gender, etc? Don't let it bring you down, make due with what you can and embrace it! You can still put your own twist on it and be yourself.

"I knew this chick in 6th-7th grade who was really into the biology teachers. Everyone knew about it, and she was into this Italian dude with a majestic black beard (its a big joke throughout the school and we now praise the beard üòÇ). Well the teacher got scared and told the administration, and she got a new bio teacher. Well, she fell for this guy too. And FYI, her new crush was in his 50‚Äôs, had kids graduating high school/college, and MARRIED. He got scared too, and she got moved to a girl teacher. She never fell for her but in 7th she got the second teacher again because we all got him too. She knew his license plate, birthday, wife‚Äôs name (with the name crossed out in big red Xs on her arm). She left the school now but as a freshman we still reference her as the with circle of hell (which is ironic because she is super religious with a hint of homophobia so we couldn‚Äôt resist making fun of her for that).




Here‚Äôs another story: I actually had a crush on a teacher once. I thought he was good-looking, funny, and I admired his intelligence. Unlike this TCC, I never actually posted anything and just kept to myself and wrote in a diary about how much I wanted it to be over because it was super unhealthy. I never really had any sexual desires because he was a tall guy compared to me so I was terrified üòÇ. Needles to say, I developed feelings for a guy in my class and moved on",46,4,2018-09-14T04:58:55.000Z,hi hungry I'm rat,UCXnGjMTCdyoK9z9tE_netmw,RgyROYtnWtk,True,Ugzk7uBNXEo2kgi18zl4AaABAg

"The psychology behind this is actually very intriguing, if not more than mildly alarming at times. It's not abnormal for kids to get crushes on their teachers. They're often respectable, supportive people who show, especially to some, levels of care that they wouldn't otherwise get. Not to mention, you're seeing these people everyday for the vast majority of the year. Feeling a ""crush"" towards a teacher is common. However, then you get to the point where (like a lot of these tumblr users), it is becoming an obsession and a state of desiring reciprocation, and that's where things start to get more than just a bit shady. It begins to call into question what sort of forms of 'affection' they receive(d) as developing young adults, and how that has shaped their attachment style. Like I said, it's not abnormal for kids to develop ""crushes"" on their teachers, but it is, and is arguably dangerous, when this develops into a sense of attachment that is perhaps standing in for something else in their lives. This isn't to say, of course, that all of these children are victims of neglect/abuse/trauma, etc., but I am curious into what the common thread is here that takes that step from a child/teenager confusing affection stemming from admiration and respect to affection leading towards romantic feelings that put them in a potentially dangerous predatory situation.",235,12,2018-09-14T04:32:15.000Z,Olivia Griffith,UCzBcJo7Vhc30BuTlL7RLOng,RgyROYtnWtk,True,Ugw6cIRA0Z4_QY54mpF4AaABAg

Also I'm now in the last year and when some guy comes for a practice in school we're judging him based on hotness.
I mean, teachers are mostly ignoring it, because it's still a weird thing to be with relationship with them (especially because they're married), but it's not illegal
But it results in the fact that some of the teachers (mainly P.E or safety education) are real pervs

"I think the idea of having a  crush on your teacher as a young person is totally fine. I personally remember a specific substitute who truly was the most BEAUTIFUL man I have ever seen, to this day, and it was just a known thing that most girls in the school had a crush on him. At the time, we were in elementary school, and he, I would guess, was in his early to mid thirties. The problem with teacher crushes is when these kids think it's actually feasible to date, sleep with, or be otherwise romantically involved with their TC's, as many of these blogs seem to believe. Of course, as literal children, they don't understand why that's so wrong, but the fact that people on Tumblr have made a whole community about it IS NOT HELPING. All it does is 1) normalise the act of attempting to seduce a person who, on average, is probably around 20 years older than you, and 2) exposes these kids to very inappropriate sexual content. I'm all for educating kids on sex and intimacy. I think if they're old enough to want to ask about that kind of stuff, they're old enough to be told. But there's a certain level of what should be told to kids of what age. This kink stuff, I would consider advanced, and shouldn't be discussed until they're of legal age, and it's honestly disturbing to think that there are little 13 year olds out there, coming home from school, logging onto Tumblr and dedicating their spare time to being part of a community that is so controversial, and explicit.",0,0,2018-09-14T03:40:45.000Z,Kerry Rose,UCOZkSwtgqJJ2szK6biXCJJw,RgyROYtnWtk,True,Ugx8HVcOhq0d0hibtdB4AaABAg

"Oh my god in like 9th or 10th grade there was this young 20-something year old student-teacher that practically every single girl student was swooning over. I never really understood why, he kinda looked like a stoner. I never learned his name so I just referred to him as Mr. Manbun. He was training to be a phys ed coach so he was always wearing really sporty clothes and shorts. When his training period ended the girls were pouting and all like ""awwwww why?? i miss him! why did he have to go???"" After training he was hired as a substitute teacher every so often for phys ed and other classes. I would literally hear girls squealing every time someone told them that he would be teaching their class that day. When he was teaching classes I would see girls literally touching his arms (especially biceps) and giggling whenever he talked and sometimes even leaning on his desk trying to look sexy.

"On my first day of eighth grade, my teacher had placed us in tables alphabetically.

Another story involving teachers. For some background information, I'm FtM, and back in eighth grade I was trying to figure myself out. So, I wore a shirt to school that was a pretty low V-neck because I had nothing else to wear. My 6th period teacher sat me in the front of the room, and I normally lean back in my seat.

"I understand that crushes can be harmless, but by ‚Äúnormalizing‚Äù teacher-student relationships, they are encouraging pedophiles to become educators. I had a teacher that many girls would flirt with and talk about how ‚Äúattractive‚Äù he was. It became a VERY common occurrence. His students would dead ass speculate about the size of his penis and how good he was in bed. That teacher began to prey upon his female students, and eventually attempted to blackmail me and several other girls into showing him our bodies for better grades. I strongly believe that the constant flirting led to the blurring of boundaries.

"I think tc are, ew. But one time I got what I would consider the exact opposite of a teacher crush. I had a male science teacher, and I don't know what it was but, he always made me really uncomfortable.

He was an asshole too. Especially one time when we were moving the classroom around and one of the guys in my class picked up a table. The teacher looked at me as I was about to do the same thing, and just said ""Those tables are heavy, you could hurt yourself.""
Bearing in mind that he had seen the guy pick up the table and he said nothing, he thought that I wouldn't be able to because I'm female. 

I didn't pick up the table then, but I did pick one up later when I made sure he was watching. Cause I was petty af.

(Now before anyone yells at me, this teacher was sexist and had his head so far up his own arse he couldn't fart without going deaf instantly. To prove my point, he once told all the girls that were in my class, during an exercise, that we didn't need to continue with it when we got tired. Didn't say shit to the guys. <- Toxic masculinity my dudes.)",42,3,2018-09-14T00:25:48.000Z,Super Geek,UC6hcUeRqlvxjs_6gLupdO2w,RgyROYtnWtk,True,UgwDTDi4EkywFXfyT454AaABAg

"My friend had a crush on our 7th grade science teacher. Even then I knew how fucked up it was, firstly he was in his 40s, married, and had children older then us, and secondly, we were actual children and she wanted to fuck him (she got suspended for drawing & writing about them having sex a few times), even then I knew it was fucking gross that she wanted to be with someone who was so obviously different then us. Even then I knew how obviously terrible it was for someone so young and inexperienced in love and the world to be with an adult. Thankfully he never returned her feelings and let her down pretty easily, but made it very clear he would never feel that way for her. Last time I spoke to her, she was 16 and dating her boss, who was easily in his 40-50s. I stopped speaking to her because she only ever talked about him, how she wanted to break apart his marriage, how she was so much better then his children and hated him spending time with them. I heard he was/is super abusive to her because he is able to control every aspect of her life; her paycheck, he knew where she lived, who her parents were, threatened to get her arrested, etc.

Lesson: children dating adults never goes well and can easily become abusive. They hold power and can easily manipulate a child who doesn't know any better.",0,0,2018-09-14T00:09:46.000Z,Kai McCoy,UCqmzu3zH6_5W-W9THcKBKNQ,RgyROYtnWtk,True,UgxhGwXiL5NzmrUdWgl4AaABAg

Hell, I‚Äôve had a crush on a teacher because they were supportive and attractive, but I never fetishized them. It was more of a respect and admiration for who they were.

"Why You Were Wrong in This Video
by your fan, Lord Chin Chin 

I love your videos, and I'm as annoyed by Onision as you, but I think you came at this video at a very biased standpoint and nitpicked a lot of irrelevant things. The one that annoyed me the most was when you asked what relevance this had to his life. Every time a straight person advocates for gay rights, we don't shut them down by asking them what relevance it has to them. But, if suddenly people need to have experiences relevant to their life to advocate for others, Onision's wife is bisexual, so he's most likely talking through her experience. Also, straight people rejecting gay people is technically the same in concept to gay people rejecting bi people. You're rejecting someone based off of their sexual preference, most of the time because you don't believe it's real, which is exactly the same. 
As for his approach to the video, your argument was very biased and had little relevancy. 3:33 to be exact. All he's doing is making a video about something he obviously feels at least somewhat passionately about (again, probably because his wife's bisexual). Maybe his approach was a bit condescending, although I don't see it? Either way, nitpicking him about his tone or choice of words is just cherry picking through his discussion points. As for him not having experience, once again, his wife is bisexual. I'm trying to say this in the nicest way possible because I love you, so please don't take offense, but you should maybe do a little more research before you make statements like that. 
The scientific approach you tried to take in order to ""debunk"" his statement about choosing a side is off track and missing the point. He wasn't trying to reveal the scientific secrets of sexual orientation; he was saying that you shouldn't tell a bi person to pick a side. Maybe that's not the most controversial statement, but now are we accusing Onision of not being controversial enough?
5:25 Once again, you nitpick irrelevant parts of the video. It was obviously just a comedy bit. And if you're trying to say that by him saying this he's bisexual, then you debunk your own point you made earlier about him not knowing anything about bisexuality. But, even if Onision wasn't joking, which is also a possibility, polysexual would be correct. He believes there are more than two genders; his wife is also gender fluid. 
Earlier, he was *not* in any way ridiculing the idea that everyone is bi. What he was trying to say was that gay people shouldn't discriminate against bi people and tell them to choose a side, because if you do you must believe that everyone is bisexual. He never said that wasn't true; he said it more as something for a gay person to think about the next time they want to tell a bi person to choose a side, because that would mean they have to be bi as well. I don't think it's very fair how you twisted his words in this segment. 
6:23 Since when do straight people know nothing about sexuality? I'm gay myself, but last time I checked straight was a sexuality as well, so that means they understand it just as well as you and I do. Just because they aren't LGBT doesn't mean they couldn't possibly understand the fluidity of sexuality; that isn't something exclusive to the gay community. So yes, Onision, as a *horrible straight person* , probably does know about how complicated it is, because he, like everyone else, has a sexuality. It's wrong to say that he can't talk about LGBT things because he's straight. That just isn't how it works and it's a rather discriminatory argument.  
6:40 That was not the conclusion he was trying to draw. Stopping the video there before he could give context was also a poor move. 
So, when the video continues and we get some context as to what he was saying, his premise makes sense: If you tell this person to pick a side, you're saying that you believe everyone can pick sides (because why would one person be able to but not another?), which means, in turn, that you picked a side yourself and that is why you identify the way you do. It might be correct or it might not be, but it makes sense.  I think at this point you're purposefully trying to find fault in every statement he makes, so you won't even consider what he's saying.  
7:03 If you believe no YouTube videos can have any effect, then why are you even reacting to this? I could do the condescending scoff thing that you did and say: ""Yes! One random lesbian girl on YouTube destroys Onision once and for all!"" But I'm not going to, because I think that's a hypocritical and easy position to take. Why are we, as LGBT people, complaining about advocacy for members of our community? Why are we mad at Onision when he sticks up for bi people? There's literally no reason, unless you hate him for other things he's done so you find little irrelevant reasons and blow them out of proportion...Yes, I'm talking about you.  
All of your arguments so far have been rhetoric, except for the irrelevant ""scientific"" tangent you went on about bisexual people. It's laughable that you would even think to criticize Onision for using *rhetoric* . And what? Do you not agree with his message or something? This is really the climax of your bias against him; you are trying so hard to find things wrong with everything Onision says that you actually disagree with this: 7:10 ?! This is what we as LGBT people have been saying for years, and all of a sudden when stupid straight Onision says it  it's just meaningless rhetoric. Talk about bias.
 9:02 All he was calling for was discussion and examination of the problem. REALLY, since when do we try to keep straight people out of LGBT issues? Anyone can weigh in, anyone can give opinions and helpful advice. If it were any other straight person, I don't think your response would have been the same. As for him not knowing anything about it, again, research! His wife is bi, and if I had to guess, he's advocating for her experiences through this video. 

Wow, I didn't mean for this to be this long or for me to get his annoyed. Once again, I'm a gay guy, I love your videos, and Onision hurts me, but you were very unfairly biased in making this and you really didn't debunk anything. We should't be complaining about advocacy for our community, and even if it comes from sources we don't like, that doesn't make it ""bullshit"". It got very tedious to watch you nitpick through all of this stuff for faults. I think you need to go at things a little more openly next time.

"Hey, so commenting from the future. I'm glad you got better. Being a tall skinnny asian (6""4 or about 194 cm) I didn't know this is a thing. I'm actually writing from a hospital because my wife is here.
I'm with you that I've never felt my body is a good representation of who I am. I've always felt my ideas, personality, etc, is a better representation of who I really am. But due to my asian background (and that I wanted to practice/liked to learn martial arts) I know that the body is what houses the mind. There is no mind without the body and vice versa. Hence, to be the best mental me I can be, I have to take care of my body. And vice versa, to be the best physical me I can be, I need to take care of my mind.

"(Big note: I'm not a pedophile.) From what I've learned with the psychology of pedophiles, it's definitely a fetish. Almost all fetishes people have, we have because of psychological effects from events/things in our childhood. This is heavily shown with pedophiles. We can't help what physically turns us on. However, we do not need to act on or participate in such fetishes. That's the huge difference. People can live as technical ""pedophiles"" (because minors physically turn them on) but if they never look at child pornography, or try to be inappropriate with a child, they can be safe in society and possibly even get help with therapy (since it does tie back to psychology in some sense). The people who act upon this fetish are traumatizing other people comfortable the rest of their lives who don't know any better, and that's what makes pedophiles so disgusting.",0,0,2018-09-12T11:12:54.000Z,julia wisner,UCthqIJK_DatuaVUoEYvK3aA,B06fv4NZQE8,True,UgwVdwiCwmaYacWEmrV4AaABAg

"Sooo... they want you to fear God? Trust me God wants EVERYbody who wants to connect with him to do so. 


God is not a dictator he is love and forgiveness. And for that I am grateful.
I have had SO many good experiences with the divine. And altho I can not prove that God is real to people I believe that it's what makes God so beautiful because we can all have different experiences with him. And I also think that God loves even the non-believers and everyone.

We as humans need to forgive, let go, know that they are loved, and love more.
Because love is what keeps everything intact (think about it).
Love is how we survive.

"I‚Äôm sooooo glad someone has talked about the study of sexuality tying into the idea that everyone IS bi to a certain degree. We don‚Äôt choose who we are most attracted to, but we do choose what we define ourselves by. Every straight person in the world has the capability to fall in love with someone of the same sex and thus be attracted to their sex characteristics via their love. Are they naturally going to choose those genitalia by default? No. But it is possible to find someone of the same sex they are attracted to in that way for whatever reason or even no reason ‚Äî simply just having a desire for that person or people. For example, I do find myself attracted to male genitalia in fantasies, but I only date, feel comfortable, and really fall in love with women. Does that make me bisexual? Kind of, but I‚Äôll never consider a man as a future significant other so I choose to define as a straight man. Trans women? Yes. Trans men? No. For me my emotional attraction is based on gender, while my sexual attraction is more open and has no limits. I honestly believe everyone is this way in varying degrees because I have seen all my peers talk about how their label only really defines who they plan on dating. Many of my gay male friends agree that they would have sex with women, watch straight porn, and fantasize about women. But they are still gay. Straight female friends alike, etcetc. The only problem I see is with straight men often being ashamed of looking into discovering their sexuality in this way because of how society has treated gay men. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs their fault and I‚Äôm probably in the minority for feeling bad for straight men and how polarized their individuality has been taught to them in society.",1,0,2018-09-11T21:04:56.000Z,M918 H728,UCNKPrGtZIP4zM0tXdEUZ-9A,vD0iKik363U,True,Ugy-mjmKUtCgCPv5Wpl4AaABAg

"Heya! So, i heard you asked about what Onisions fans are like. Well, i used to be a fan. A huge fan, until i realized what a scumbag he is. He changed me in ways i wish didn't change me, but anyway, heres the story.

I cant remember when i found Onision, but it was a bit before his kinda cool death note series. I would go through the little thoughts i had as a fan, but instead ill just say how his content effected me and my personality.

Firstly, I'd like to mention i am currently fourteen, and was much much younger when i first watched him, and therefore i had a very moldable mind.

Onision continuously preached ""the truth"", which is the one thing which effected me positively. His version of the truth disgusts me now, but the way he preached the truth made me more truthful, which was good for me, because i was previously a pathological liar.

But as i said, that was the only positive effect i took from him. I deeply believed this man could do no wrong. I thought everything he said was true, and everything he did was right. Leaving someone in his basement, saying awful things about suicide, the underaged girls sending photos... I defended it all. And because i deeply believed it, i became this disgusting, awful human that i look back on and just hate myself for it.

Because of Greg, i developed a god complex. A bad one. I believed because i was truthful, that i was better than everyone. My family, my friends, they were dumb and stupid, and simply couldn't comprehend my intellect. I remember the worst part was when i fought with my brother. I took an insane amount of joy in making him suffer. I would call my brother a ""pathetic useless dog"", and ordered him to sit, bark and lay down. I was a disgusting person at that time.

I wasn't suicidal at the time i watched him, but he contributed to my suicidal thoughts deeply. I remember in one of his old ""rate me"" Videos he called a young girl fat, who was just a bit bigger than me. I am not fat at all, but ever since i saw that I've despised my body completely. I came to the point where i attempted to starve myself, before my dad made me eat. I didn't want to eat though. I hated what i saw in the mirror, and i wanted to destroy myself, and hurt myself, and watch myself die. it was an awful time for me, legitimately.

The time i stopped being his fan was around the Billie controversy. I preached that forcing her to get a tattoo, locking her up in a basement, etc, was right. But i didn't feel that way at all. I tried to convince myself that it was right, but for once i couldn't agree with him, though i pretended to. 

the time i unsubcribed from all his channels and began to openly hate him was when Christina Grimmie died. I wasn't a fan of her, and i never knew who she was. But seeing Onision openly mock the death of her made me sick. It was disgusting. I don't care what your opinion on Christianity and praying is, because when it comes down to it, the praying was beautiful. Millions of people praying in the memory of that beautiful, talented girl. And he shit on it... So that's when i realized he was an asshole, and began despising him.


Just to be clear, i no longer have a stupid god complex and i have regained some lost confidence, though it still effects me a bit. not all Onion boy fans will feel the same as me, but still, that's my story.",1,0,2018-09-11T10:41:38.000Z,Fujo Space,UC8gwEzjkeHF4VPnMYrY03jQ,Gfiv2eiV0Jg,True,UgzIwgknAOPZWDusLep4AaABAg

"SO I was dating this girl in my sophomore year of high school (YAAAAY), and things were going well. She was a year younger than me and we had gone to the same middle school AND had been crushing on each other but just never approached the topic. So when we started actually dating it didn't surprise anyone (I was THE GAY GIRL TM at my middle school even though I came out as pan). Well my mom and dad absolutely hated her, they said she was just all around trashy and that I could find someone better, that she would one day ""stab me in the back with a smile on her face and laugh as I bleed out""... thanks mom. Well I (being an idiot who thought this was the best course of action) decided to 'test' her. I had my, at the time, best friend try to get her to talk trash about me. She didn't so I thought my maybe mom was wrong. About a month later I break up with her in the fear that maybe things will end badly. Every thing was fine until she decided to try and steal my best friend  and then spread lies about me to her. Didn't work out on her part. So the girl later gets a new boyfriend, a good guy, I knew him well. I still hadn't offically gotten over her so I kept a good distance away from her at all times. When I did finally get over her (we've been broken up for at least 6 months by then), I decided to give her back a promise ring she had given to me on my birthday. Her and her bf were always walking together and I didn't want to start drama, so i put it in her locker. A coward move but I thought it would be the best course of action. She. was. PISSED. She went off on me, claiming I had ""no right"" to do something like that to her. She then proceeded to tell me that her reletionship with the dude was failing and that I chose the wrong time to do this. I cut her off with an ""I dont care if it's failing, i just wanted to give this back because I don't have the right to keep it. Goodbye"". And to me that was that. Not to her, she made a big scene at lunch and tried to act all heart broken, meanwhile her boyfriend asked me what had happened and he didn't see what the big deal was either. After that I just made it my duty to never be within a 7-foot radius of her. She somehow always found a reson to talk to me. She later succeded in stealing my best friend, but good ridance. So if you plan on having a relationship, make sure youre both mentally stable.",0,0,2018-09-10T07:27:33.000Z,Halo Kenobi,UChQhXLO0Wa7n6ix0FlSBRJQ,x1Jptp72oRE,True,UgzR6Z-mKR1g4PBLHyN4AaABAg

"This comment goes to every unattractive guy who thinks that they‚Äôll never find love because of his looks. Not to toot my own horn but I have been called ‚Äúattractive‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äú  by many of my peers  and I honestly would rate myself at 7.5 out of 10 on a general scale. I am 20 years old and work two jobs. 
My friend Ben and I have been very close friends for over six years now and recently I realized that I was in love with him.  I always had a crush on him but I didn‚Äôt want to risk ruining our friendship and finally I decided to take the leap of faith.  He is 5‚Äò9‚Äù,  has acne and rosacea,  is very underweight  (He used to struggle with anorexia :(   ),  he has a crooked nose that I adore,  small soft hands,  and he rarely goes outside so he is pale .  I find him absolutely adorable in looks and mind.  Him and I have been dating for almost a year now and I haven‚Äôt even considered being with another because everything about him makes me so happy.  He is so sweet to me and all around just a generally good person who I always have a fantastic time with.  No Chad or Stacy could ever replace him.  So to all of you naysayers out there,  I am living proof that healthy relationships do exist even for ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù guys/girls,  and that if you aren‚Äôt finding love you probably just have a shitty personality .

"I'm not totally sure about all the other things, but as far as tarot goes, it doesn't tell you the future. Because the future can change. Tarot cards are more for advice or they can tell you what direction you're headed, but the cards are essentially just a physical layout of your energy. Doing tarot readings for people who aren't physically there is impossible. Because their energy isn't present and thus can't effect the cards. The cards can tell you ""if you continue doing this, you'll end up in a bad place. Here's how to avoid that. "" or ""in order to get the best out of a situation, keep this in mind"" but you can't predict the exact outcome of anything.

"I feel like the people who say being gay is bad because it says so in the Bible probably don‚Äôt follow many of the other rules in the Bible. They use the Bible to justify their corrupt beliefs, when the real reason is that change frightens and confuses them. They were likely raised to follow the Bible, and when you‚Äôre a kid your knowledge of the world usually comes from your parents and other adults in your life. When a kid is raised by parents that say the only way to live life is how the Bible tells you to, they almost always grow up believing those things to be true if they don‚Äôt have any reason to think otherwise. In just the past 100 years so many things about society have changed. Many people, like pretty much anyone watching this video, have chosen to embrace that change and change our outlooks in life, or have simply been raised to believe these new ideas instead of the old ones. Some people don‚Äôt want change, though. People like these girls who have likely been raised to believe what they believe now, don‚Äôt like change. It‚Äôs hard to accept that maybe everything you‚Äôve been taught in life isn‚Äôt actually true. They don‚Äôt want to accept the fact that it is actually possible to live your life happily without following the rules in the Bible, because they‚Äôve believed everything their family has told them their entire life. It‚Äôs hard to admit that you might actually be wrong, and to consider someone else‚Äôs viewpoint for a change.

Basically what I‚Äôm saying is that people like this usually think they‚Äôre smarter than they are. They think there is no way they can be wrong, even when there is more evidence pointing to them being wrong. They deny any attempt to convince them that they are wrong because they are to stubborn to understand that their opinion isn‚Äôt fact. I‚Äôm not saying that everyone who is religious is stupid, but people like these girls in the video are likely not the sharpest knives in the drawer. I don‚Äôt want to be rude, but to put it bluntly, I don‚Äôt think they are intelligent enough to understand and accept change. They think that what they believe is the only way to live life, and they try to use religion to justify it. They‚Äôve fooled themselves into thinking religion is the reason they hate change, when it really isn‚Äôt. The real reason is that they can‚Äôt comprehend the idea that what they‚Äôve thought all their lives may be wrong. I don‚Äôt think they understand why people change because they aren‚Äôt smart enough to question why we do things the way we do. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm super smart, I‚Äôm just saying that most people are smart enough to question why we live like we do, but some people have very simple minds and only do what they think is right because they were told that it‚Äôs the way they‚Äôre supposed to live.

Sorry for rambling, I‚Äôm just kind of trying to figure out how these people come to the conclusions they have.",24,0,2018-09-08T21:15:11.000Z,WasabiKitKat,UCY3TQdxyTz0KOkeQUNKBZtg,DO5d4PYyn4g,True,UgyzmSR4pU7GNdl_RYl4AaABAg

"i'm gay, christian, trans and have 3 different [and very old] bibles w/ the old and new testament and not once do they mention anything to do with being in a same-sex relationships being wrong. granted, they don't really mention them at all, but at the same time no statement made in any of them can be taken as homophobic or against people in general unless you already have the idea in your head and interpret it as such.
or... i guess some people use the fact that adam and eve existed as reason why same-sex marriages/relations are wrong but COME ON, for one adam and eve were the only NAMED humans and there were actually other people placed on earth if we're to believe the christian creation story. this means that adam and eve just happened to be hetero and named. the other people, however, cannot be spoken for because we didn't know anything about them. those people could have been any range of sexuality or felt any range of gender. who knows?
also, second argument against the adam and eve thing is if youre going to populate the planet, you're not going to make the first people all male or all female [biologically and as we know those sexes today] because with no adoption since the world is literally brand new, there's no possible way that just having one sex would continue the species because they can't reproduce.
and don't even get me started on people who use the bible to try justify why trans people are 'wrong'. there is literally nothing in the bible that supports that point of view. at that point, its literally just using religion to try justify your opinions.

"Honestly, I used to be an onion boy fan. A while ago when I was... way too young for such content. I had suicidal thoughts, I used to cut and I had issues with my body image. For some reason, onion did get me to stop cutting. Out of shame, though. I fell back into that hole constantly and would watch a video that would tell me that it was all my fault. I would cry myself to sleep, thinking about how I'm terrible and that I should die. I found a Leafy (woo boy, this is all downhill huh) video criticizing onion boy and found myself agreeing with a lot of what he said (I'm really sorry). Leafy also, as you all probably know, promoted a pretty toxic mindset as well but it distracted me from my thoughts (he posted daily...) so I ignored the fact that he was being really mean. But thank the lords, I soon found other youtubers (Shane Dawson, Cryaotic, etc.) who weren't total scumbags and helped me to become more positive. I was confident enough to talk with my parents about everything and slowly I got better. I see a psychologist, I'm totally comfortable with myself... mostly... and I really only have problems with public speaking and... talking to people I don't know too well... I can't even talk to some of my classmates without messing up all over the place. But I can joke about it now and I have people around me and online who are amazingly kind and caring, who joke around too but make sure I'm alright.
