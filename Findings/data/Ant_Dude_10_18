"Megaman & Bass was meant as a endpoint for the classic series by Inafune. It made the gameboy series canon, the database closes the classic series in a good way and it pushes the classic series from 20xx into 200x. And Inafune wanted the hardest game in the series by going back deep into the 80's difficult wise.

Then Inafune sold the rights for a second game to Bandai. Megaman & Bass 2 on WonderSwan is a whole different beast. It is the first and only one where Megaman gets different weapons then Bass. And it has some other innovations that made the series ready for 200x. But Megaman & Bass 3 on the WonderSwan Crystal came never to be. It is a shame. I would love to see a third one, the second one left a lot of questions open.

Megaman & Bass is the toughest, meanest and most brutal in the entire series. This motherfucker is there for only one reason: To kill you, teach you pain and push you over the edge.",0,0,2018-10-19T01:50:51.000Z,Peter Ludwig,UCTXE1ZG71BjZIN6szGbVYeg,hKIgQKM4ieM,True,UgzVYCQj3xV0EnEjU9R4AaABAg

"See heres my take. This game? Challenging? In a sense. But, heres the thing. I feel there is a difference between ""challenging"" and ""unfair"". This game is challenging but fair. At no point did I feel cheated in a death. Not even on burner mans stage. Contrast that with megaman 9 and 10 which are ""unfair"". I mean come on, when you have a game where you cant even complete a simple JUMP because you arent far enough over on a platform? Really? Additionally, the boss patterns in 9 and 10 are extremely hard as well UNLESS you have the boss weakness, and even the guy you're supposed to beat with the gun is extremely difficult.

"Am I the only one who thinks this game is better than Adventure? 

I see people criticize this game for only having 7 abilities, but since each one functions significantly differently with each animal friend and with just Kirby, it's really 28, compared to Adventure's 20. In addition, the gameplay was more interesting, since each animal friend changed up how you played, even ignoring abilities.

Much more importantly, I found the level design to be much better in this game. Adventure's levels just felt very bland to me compared to this game.",0,0,2018-10-17T21:09:17.000Z,RothRocks2000,UC3xy6eGAYPzG4cxfa508hAg,IYBzCt4oB9A,True,UgxaoqBz-UcxaoqFyWF4AaABAg

""Like he's confused"" Because HE IS!!

 ""characters say things and stuff""? IT'S CALLED STORY CONTEXT!!

""vehicles are new""  NO! Sonic 2; Sky Chase, Sonic Drift,  Sonic R,  to name a few.

""don't use Chaos Control"" What, you mean the power bypass hard platforms and fight rooms? (noob)

""There are three factions"" you ignorant little... There is ALSO G.U.N., Only like the SECOND MOST IMPORTANT SIDE TO THE STORY!! (witch again, you missed.)

Shadow is the way he is because of the events of the previous games, He fell from space, was barely saved by Robotnik/Eggman, found by Rouge, Has amnesia, because of the Shadow Androids he fears he might be one, sets off to find his past, and Black Doom is the first one to give him a clue So OF COURSE he's gonna follow that lead. (It's called continuity)

so Shut up, and ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME!!!  (Basic reading is required to fully enjoy the story)

"I usually like your videos, but I must really disagree with you on this one. 
It looked like you were trying to speedrun your way through the game and got punished for it. I also noticed that you didn't even mention collecting the CDs at all, and that you need to play as both Mega Man and Bass to get all 100 of them.
Also, you can move while shooting as Bass, if you are in the air. And his Dash-Jump -> Double-Jump would make Zero jealous, he can cover some serious distance doing it. Also, Bass doesn't even need the Slide to dodge when he has better options. And he can get an accessory that increases the attack power of the Bass Buster, making it easier to take down guys like Dynamo Man, all Bass has to do is aim up at the charging rods.
 As for Burner Man, just watch him, he will always dash 2 or 3 times between attacks, then you can counterattack. Pirate Man is a pushover against the Wave Burner, and his stage isn't that hard in the bubble area, and there's an extra life around there somewhere, too. You should never get hit by Ground Man, and you should NEVER detonate the remote mines yourself! Attach a bomb to him, and when he tries to dig, he will instead take damage. Tengu Man's stage isn't difficult after the first part, and the Spread Drill does a lot of damage, and knocks him down to the ground too, and it's easy to get in his face to do it. Magic Man's stage can be tricky at first, if you're not paying attention, and you can damage him three different ways with the Tengu Blade. Astro Man's stage can be a little tricky, but that whitescreen area with the enemies is actually a great spot to get 999 screws. There's no fast way to take down Astro Man, just equip Super Armor. Use Energy Saver for Dynamo Man. You can pause the game if he goes to heal to get rid of the copy, just choose another weapon in the menu. And you can jump through those platforms. Bass can simply shoot the healing rods from the ground.",0,0,2018-10-17T19:17:50.000Z,Mr. Mystere,UCIVGHOyIoU_31i09sPeWgIg,hKIgQKM4ieM,True,UgxrsyI5LgXU5pCaIOR4AaABAg

"Dynamo man is the freaking Devil as Megaman.(not the yellow variety) The weapon that is his supposed weakness does nothing, Copy Vision which you get from Astro man. It just neutralizes his projectiles, but doesn't actually damage him. The Son of a Bit.. heals himself, and you need break both sides of his rig to kick him out of it, which Megaman has to jump up there...like why not made magic card his weakness, a weapon that can be aimmed vertically? That makes too much sense.

Yeah Burner man weakness works really poorly too. That's generally a pet peeve of mine when a weakness works really badly or even out right fails.(Zero's ice attack in X6 fails the hardest, as it requires ceiling to use, and the boss it is used on doesn't have one! Epic fail.) If I want to take it upon myself to fight a boss with my buster or throw myself at them and hope I got the right tools, that's my choice. I generally like to discover the order on my own, and figure it out, but don't handicap me with broken tools Capcom. 

As Bass he's much more manageable as since you can simply fire up and wreck his healing rig he jumps into in a few secs. In general Bass is just much easier to play as in this game. He aims in multiple directions, double jumps, and has a jet pack to fly with treble. Megaman just gets shafted in comparison.

Yeah that last boss gauntlet with King is rough. If I wasn't playing it on a rom with save states I'd never bothered completing this game. It was not a fun game, and I slogged thru it just do so, as I could then see what it was about. Well is the worst megaman Game...X 7 still beats it for me.

"*Short version:* I've played _Mega Man_ through _Mega Man 8_ for the core series, and would have played more recent entries if not for... complications.  AntDude just flat out gets it *wrong* in the video.  If you're a Mega Man newbie, do *not* start with Mega Man & Bass.  If you're a casual, save it until you've ""level-up"". ;)  If you claim to be a competent or experienced player and are all ""This game is the worst!"" you need to admit that is due to personal tastes, because I am telling you that I prefered Mega Man & Bass *on the GBA* to Mega Man 7 and Mega Man 8!  Why?

*Long version:* Mega Man & Bass is a _flawed_ entry, but if you like the fundamentals of Mega Man, it is still a *solid* entry.  If you're like me, and your *biggest* gripe about the series is that most games only let you play as Mega Man, it even jumps to above average for a Mega Man game, and the entire series strikes me as ""above average to great"" when it comes to video games.  The above video exaggerates.  *A lot.*  It actually becomes a good learning experience; while some Mega Man games are objectively better than others, personal preferences (and sometimes nostalgia) really skew things.

The one *truly* cheap thing, that isn't found in other games other than also falling under ""Cheap spot"", is that weird jet-thingy boss that becomes the torso of a later boss.  This was legitimately bad; far too difficult as Mega Man and tedious as Bass.  If it ruins the game for you, I understand, *but* I'll point out Wily's final form in Mega Man 7 and the Wily Stage ""Jump! Jump! Slide! Slide!"" section in Mega Man 8 do the same for me, with Mega Man 8 also suffering because the visuals just seem ""off"" *plus* there are a fixed amount of Bolts so you've got to hunt for them *and* figure out which power-ups are best for Mega Man, instead of just buying them all.  Yeah, those are *serious* issues to me... and at worst a nuisance to others. ;)

Several other examples in the video, like that platforming segment with the balloons and spike ceiling, the Burner Man battle, and the spikes-hidden-by-the-foreground?  Half the story.  The balloon/spiked-ceiling thing is just classic Mega Man, so adding a re-spawning 1-Up actually *is* being generous... and some players won't struggle with it at all.  Burner Man needing to be on-screen to take the full damage from pushing him onto the spikes is bad, and I think the fight is too tough *but* as a long time fan I _appreciate_ what the developers were going for because fans have *wanted* more in-depth fights for years.  Yeah, even back then!  The bit where the foreground covered spikes... that was a *telegraphed trap* where not only did you learn earlier in the game to be wary of places the foreground obscured, but AntDude just needed to own up to failing to see the visible spike.  I don't know if you can even easily hit that visible spike; it may *only* exist to warn you about the ones you can't see!

The GBA version does suffer from screen crunch; I can only guess because I never played the Super Famicom version, but the second (or is it the third by that point?) King fight suffers when you're playing as Bass because the bit you need to shoot is actually off-screen. @_@  There are then many smaller problems, but a lot of the above videos complaints seem to be exaggerations or examples of personal preference/capability.",1,0,2018-10-16T21:55:55.000Z,Otaku,UC3oJF_xTfN72AMeCuJCl5Jg,hKIgQKM4ieM,True,UgynGgDYjQ_H3WjWkLp4AaABAg

"This is actually my favorite game in the series. I wasn't aware of some of those flaws at all while playing the game, but I definitely agree with many of them after seeing the video. For some reason they never bothered me, though, and I actually really enjoyed the bosses. One thing I also really loved that wasn't mentioned at all in this video was the database. You could collect CDs hidden throughout the entire game to collect some data on robot masters and more. There were a few ones that were frustrating to get, but most of them were really fun and some quite well hidden. I enjoyed going through all of the levels again and searching for those CDs, it gave the game a lot more value.
As for the big imbalance between Mega Man and Bass, I agree that it exists and is definitely a flaw, though again it's something that has never really bothered me. Bass definitely made the game quite manageable, and Mega Man always felt like he was intended as some kind of ""hard mode"". Even one of his introduction portraits is literally just him giving a thumb up, like he was saying ""yeah, I don't have a third ability, but you'll be so cool if you manage to beat the game with me"". That's not to say he didn't have any advantages, though. I personally think that bosses were actually easier to beat with him thanks to his charge shot. Bass' buster takes out their health so slowly.
A lot of this may come down to nostalgia, because I was way younger when I played this game and wasn't aware of these flaws back then, but I'm still very disappointed the game wasn't included in the Legacy Collection. I personally just don't feel this strongly for the prior Mega Man games and had very little reason to get the Legacy Collection, and while one might argue that they left the game out because it was to ""mediocre"", I'll point out that they included Mega Man X6 and X7 in the X Legacy Collection, despite a lot of people not liking these games, so I think that Mega Man & Bass absolutely deserved a spot in the Legacy Collection.",0,0,2018-10-16T18:38:35.000Z,RPGHacker86,UCQKYmSLryiL38yim7q_oeVg,hKIgQKM4ieM,True,Ugx6Ro0-VAruauHjw9B4AaABAg

"I'm sorry, I love your videos but this... is kind of disappointing. While some complaints I agree with, (like the spike pit with the one visible spike and otherwise totally obscured from play) there are others that quite frankly are you playing poorly. The spears coming out of nowhere were set in a specific pattern. If you slowed down, you would have noticed this and gotten past safely. The bubble part with the spikes below could have been prevented if you slowed down and looked where you were going instead of trying to rush ahead quickly. The instant-kill flames are avoidable with the Ice wall, but even failing that, you tried to rush ahead and missed so many of your shots on one enemy.

"Ok heres my opinions on this game. Im sorry but I highly disgagree with what you said with the weapons. I say they are the better ones there has been plenty of times I used the weapons. Secondly Ground Man is not that hard I say hes one of the fair ones I prefer to go him first there just that him burying himself takes awhile. Level Design oh yeah it has bullshit moments. I really love fighting the robot masters actually with the weaknesses except burner man and Astro Man. As someone who has beaten Astro Man first in this game before oh boy lots of game overs. Honestly Im I the only one who dont mind playing Megaman in this game like yeah bass makes the bullshit parts of it more tolerable but whenever I play the stages as Megaman I tend to use more of the weapons cause they can kill easier or have better range except the end which my next opinion covers? The King Stages yeah I hate them worst castle in the series especially as megaman.  Im sorry but I consider that spike moment your fault why would you want to go down a quicksand mechanic when you clearly see the ladder?

"MMB is honestly a guilty pleasure of mine. Most of the robot masters werent too hard once I figured em out(except Burner Man and Magic Man they can go fuck themselves)but the king jet was PAINFUL especially since the level wasnt even bad. 4 stressful bosses into one level just doesnt work well. Also you didnt mention how wily shoves all 8 robot masters behind death gauntlet rooms that you have to go through before fighting wily himself. In the same stage. I enjoyed the levels aside from stages like burner man, tengu man, and king/wily stage 3 but i can easily understand why people dont like it.

"Honestly, I was kind of underwhelmed when I played this game for the first time. The difficulty is high, but it's not like it's one of the hardest games ever made. I'd say the final level is the only one I would truly consider ""bullshit"", and while really hard, the game does present some pretty fun and dynamic levels and bosses. I mean, I'd say these bosses are more interesting than your standard ""jump and shoot a thing"" style bosses that the classic series was becoming oversaturated with before 7. I just thought this game was a fun challenge, and though Bass makes it easier, I usually run through it as Megaman now that I know how the game is.

Your first 1-3 playthroughs will be nightmarish, yes, but once you get the hang of it and start playing a bit more patiently, I think the game gets a hell of a lot better.

"The thing with the game is that, yeah, it's difficult (and sometimes unfair) that any other classic game only because of bad level design (and the freaking Tanks level). The rest of the difficulty is because, since it only came out in japan at first, sometimes those games are tougher that usual. 
I still don't get why there's a small room that you need to use all of the bosses's weapons to open the way to King's Castle. Even that i still thing that Megaman 9 is harder. Not a bad game, but just a difficult one.
You may think that the game was more designed for be playable with Bass (even that his Trebble fusion is very nerfed in attack power, and only works for travel trough the levels with ease), but the bosses, withouth their weaknesses, not only are though, but slow to kill. 6 robot masters would be ok, taking Tengu Man and Astro Man out of the formula. And the Shop is a life saver. Makes your life less hellish.
Even that i get a very hard time to beat it, i still enjoy playing it and looking for the data disks after.

"Still really like this game.  By far not the worst classic game, it's just one of the hardest.  I can agree the flying machine boss in King's Fortress is pretty rough, especially if you aren't using Bass.  I don't quite agree with your assessment on the level design, but then maybe you expect the game to be much easier than me.  For example, that segment of Tengu Man's stage is not nearly as bad as you say it is, and as you said it gives you an extra life.  An extra life implies they know it is a tricky jump.  I'd rather take the challenge than get a cake walk.  Another thing I wanted to point out is, yes, King's fight is not too bad (you said this is an issue of balancing the difficulty): did you consider that maybe the devs knew the previous fights were harder and wanted to give you a break (or reduce the chances of failure)?  Maybe if you were being more patient (Mega Man games usually require that, they're typically not meant to be cake walks), these would not be seen as frustrating as often.",0,3,2018-10-16T00:06:37.000Z,D.R.

"Ant, I gotta be honest, this was a pretty terrible review of the game. I know hardcore analysis isn't the content you make, but the amount of mistakes made in this video were just baffling. Almost all of the gameplay clips showcasing how """"""bad"""""" the game's level design is (barring some exceptions, like the King 1 boss and the Tengu Man platforming section), were all caused by your own impatience, failure to read the situation at hand, and overall incompetent playing. You also don't cover things in-depth whatsoever: Things like the special weapons, which are the best in the entire series next to 9, are skimmed over with just ""hurrdurr weakness order weird"".

In the end, this is a Mega Man game for people who have played these games and know how their design goes, much like Mega Man 9. It expects you to understand how its mechanics and levels all work and are laid out, since, if you bought a SNES Mega Man game in 1998 its safe to say you were a fan of the series. Even still, nothing in this game is more unfair than whats seen in games like 1, 3, 8, and ESPECIALLY 9 and 10. Its bosses are the most complex and consistently fun and can all be beaten with nothing but the tools you're required to have upon fighting them, and the soundtrack is a blessing to the ears.

Like it or not yourself, saying such a key part of Mega Man's history should be ""left forgotten"", when absolute dumpsterfires like Mega Man X6 and X7 got to return for the X Legacy Collection, is genuinely insulting.",105,57,2018-10-15T23:36:13.000Z,Mellon,UCSkvPdLrHC3zSLsar5JdNJA,hKIgQKM4ieM,True,UgzeXFA7Ly9av85gqTF4AaABAg

""Remember when I said you should start off at Cold Man? Because he's the only one that's actually kind of decent.""

I'd disagree. While yes, most of the bosses in this game are disasters, Ground Man is an absolutely excellent robot master. His pattern (save for the Spread Drill attack, which can feel inconsistent at times) is top-notch, his attacks are clearly telegraphed, his fight is very rewarding to learn, and the Pirate Bomb is an absolute joy to use against him, should you choose to go with his weakness. Attaching a bomb to him and having him try to burrow underground, only to get launched out by an explosion is just the cherry on top.",19,5,2018-10-15T23:26:27.000Z,Noah M.,UC4zYtbkoPF3A8Sn-WURytiA,hKIgQKM4ieM,True,UgxPptID_N8X1zDFm0l4AaABAg

No offense, everybody has their own opinion, but you're making the game out to be way worse than it is. 
I still love the game for everything it is (except Blinkx2) and would totally recommend it. 
It's fun, colourful and all the collectibles give you a reward. Light gems unlock power ups and eggs unlock usable models (Ember and Flame), viewable models, concept art and mini games. Theres unlockable powers you can get for Spyro in the shop which make the game easier and more fun. I think the music was good as well, magical, fitting the polished up world.

Assuming the main idea was having a game more like Super Mario 64, they seem pretty obvious:

-> special purpose hat

"Glover has been one of my fave N64 games for many, many years! I still have it to this day. ^w^

It's a personal treasure of mine. :)

I also noticed that Glover is a right hand and Cross-Stitch is a left head. Being left-handed was used to be seen as a disorder.
The main bad guy being a literal left hand seems to be a hidden message saying that left-handed people are bad, though it doesn't matter which hand, left or right, is your dominant hand.

In the end, I still love this game. ^^
And out of all the cheat codes in the game, there's 1 code that I wanna know--if it even exists, that is--and that's the potion that turns Glover into a helicopter. This potion was used in one of the Carnival levels, 1 Bonus Level, and in a Fortress of Fear level.",0,0,2018-10-03T20:12:25.000Z,Millennium Shadow,UC_iaVVAMfr6fosH4pgAeFkg,zjahtcvQH24,True,Ugw3t6VIayRRJYh7tRB4AaABAg

you ever play 'rocket the robot'?  that was an awesome n64 platformer.  i actually got it through a mail order '2 for 1' deal that was for that, tonic trouble and rayman 2 for $100 (each was still selling for $40-50, so it was a sick deal).  can't remember where the mail order form came from, but i believe it was packed in with another game i bought.  it was also only for those games, not like a 'choose 3' type of thing.",0,0,2018-10-03T03:42:14.000Z,Leo Watley,UCJGaa5peEnWC-GAIQXg2z5Q,mfX_RDgAx08,True,UgwZlvx-jnNFSDNssnV4AaABAg

"I know this is not really that off topic, but it kinda is, but this is why I think Encore Mode is a clone of Mania Mode and how Ray and Mighty can be played in Mania Mode. The reason Encore mode is a clone of Mania Mode is because when the Heavy Magician took hold of the Phantom Ruby and repaired the other robots the Phantom Ruby became confused because it hasn't been used a lot and it was in the past and future, so it just combined the past and future, and that's why Encore Mode is a replica of Mania Mode. The reason Mighty and Ray are in Mania Mode is probably because people got a copy of Sonic & Mighty or Sonic & Ray, and stuck onto the Sonic Mania cartridge, making them playable, like Knuckles in Sonic 2.",1,0,2018-10-03T02:28:37.000Z,Lanceypantsy17 Gaming,UCmuKHhn4AT39mDwnwSPYxgA,Jlw4wm3GMNo,True,UgxzvA9W-yz_zwOo6xh4AaABAg

"I had a similar feeling like in the original paper mario, even if the fighting system is still not that good.
Yeah, the feeling of an open world is really the best thing in Color Splash. Especially this is amazing for a level based game.
You often have to travel to levels on the other side of the map or revisit finished levels to progress. Often some levels open, but you cannot do anything there, yet, until something different happens. That's a pretty fun way to implement backtracking even in a pretty linear game.
I didn't know in Sticker Star, I need some special item, so most of the time I had a hard time beating the bosses ^^ (except for the blooper, where it was too easy after using the item).
And there are also some pretty cool levels and chapters with cool music. I liked the small level, where the professor lost his chomp (cool music), the pirate chapter (multiple cool musics, pretty epic presentation, really felt like searching for a treasure), and the SM3 levels.
The Koopalings are really a bit too much. I like interesting bosses and even if they were pretty interesting, they could have been more varied, when not using koopalings.
And the game is still a bit shorter, because there are less interesting secrets, interesting characters or reasons to even find secrets (like becoming better at battles).
Especially the boss fortress was very boring (except of the way, you travel to it). It was very short. Even Super Paper Mario, which was probably the shortest Paper Mario game had a better last fortress.",0,0,2018-10-02T12:29:48.000Z,porky11,UCZCfmzIPSg91hpFasILFz9A,08WgFvfp2Tc,True,UgyxemKd-RWCnlGvNV14AaABAg

Glover is one of those games I feel new age physics would have helped SO fucking much. If there was any old school out of context game to reboot it would be this. I feel it deserves a revival with more physics friendly gameplay. There's so fucking much you can do with a physical hand controlling a ball. Some modern gameplay it could really work. Then change the glove types to allow for even more crazy control and strangeness/references in the most autistic of ways.

"Oh man, it's honestly great to see people talk about Glover after all this time, given how it is still a bit of an obscure title. Either way, a video about Glover is a video I enjoy.

I honestly love the game despite it's clear flaws, to the point I have it  in my top five N64 platformers. Unwarranted admiration? Maybe, but I've loved the game ever since I went to a ressle shop as a kid looking for Donkey Kong 64, and ended up getting Glover, and Pokemon Snap. It brought a lot of concepts to the table, surprisingly decent ball physics for the time, and one of my favorite soundtracks on the console. I honestly could see this game making a comeback should anyone gain the rights, though given the most likely contender might be Atari by now, if anyone, that'll be a challenge not worth the trouble. They hoard IPs they never intend to use almost as badly as Microsoft.

Either way, fantastic video on Glover, I think you covered the positives, and negatives well, although I'll always love the game for it's potential, and the interesting changes it brought to the table.

"Okay so you know the one game that you lend to a friend, and maybe borrow a game in exchange? Seeing this video makes me feel guilty because of that and now I have to talk about it so I can sleep at night.
Sooo when I was ten or eleven I had a friend who had this game. I wasn't that interested until I saw what kind of cheats it has.
My little brother had a copy of Mario 64 that was used, so one of the files already had all of the stars. Of course my friend also had a copy but he didn't have nearly as many stars on it, so he wanted to borrow my little brother's copy. I verbally bullied my little brother into letting my friend borrow the copy so we could borrow Glover. (""Bullied"" as in ""don't you want to do this and this?! Don't you want to play a new game?!"") I borrowed/lent games with this friend before with no problems so I wasn't worried.

And then we moved and lost all contact with my friend. So not only did I have his copy of Glover that he'll never see again, my little brother was so upset that he lost his copy of Mario 64. He was able to buy the DS remake of Mario 64 years later, but he's the one who paid for it.

This was fifteen-or-so years ago but I still feel really guilty about it. I could've at least paid for the remake. If I were to bring this up to him now he would probably laugh, but I'm still very sorry about it.",0,0,2018-09-30T07:53:08.000Z,CallMeFreakFujiko,UCixLPpmGBo46yi-8OljdbSQ,zjahtcvQH24,True,UgydhnDMqeeLm5Rq52V4AaABAg

It was cancelled because they printed too many copies of 
Glover. The was a Sale on Nintendo 64 cartridges. 
Hasbro games was closed down, 
due to poor management decisions. Shame I would have liked to played Glover 2.

But think of this, u get the original DS one, instead of the wii one, u jump to wii u version! that is overall improvement cause other than adding Yoshi; Wii NSMB was lame as hell. And while kirby did start off strong with it's releases on handheld and the latest on Switch; it's gotten dull AF now. I played the through Star Allies on Switch, other than Bosses that actually tried to kick your ass for once, man was it dull! i'm not not gonna like, the last 2/3rds of the game i was on cruise control. i just wanted to see that next boss fight cause i was bored shitless. i just wanted it to be over.

"The through line here is that that every major cartoony mascot character wore white gloves. Mickey Mouse, Sonic the Hedgehog, Mario.

"I’ll share a little bit of history I have with Mischief Makers. My dad kind of came home one day with a new N64, as well as a few games. One of those games was Mischief Makers, however, it was a Japanese version of the game. This wasn’t too long into the N64’s lifetime and I was young. Anyway, I ended up playing the game, but being in Japanese, I didn’t understand a single word. I had to figure out all the mechanics by myself, not only that, I even made up my own story and gave every NPC a name. I took my time with the game, and I played levels over and over again, young me was really patient with her games, way more patient than I am nowadays, honestly. I actually didn’t even know the name of the game until I was about 15, and a friend I had at the time lent me his copy of the game to play. So I got to experience the game for the first time in my first language.

"One WiiWare game I miss is LIT. Made by WayForward Technologies, the makers of Shantae, LIT was a horror puzzle game. You play as Jake, an emo high school student who fell asleep in home room and woke up to find that not only is was the school overtaken by a sinister darkness, but his emo girlfriend, Rachiel, was also missing. So you have to go from classroom to classroom to get from point A to point B using various light sources like TVs and computers to avoid touching the darkness, or the demons of your former classmates will drag you into the darkness. There are occasional boss fights and the game gets pretty hard towards the end. WayForward did re-release this game on mobile and PC, but the gameplay has been simplified and the art style changed from realistic to Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World’s cartoony arcade art style. So the WiiWare version is one-of-a-kind.

I know some would disagree, but I find the way that the visuals in Mischief Maker have aged to be immensely charming. The certain level of pixelization, the stop motion style, combined with the frame rate seen here, it all looks like a little story book come to life. I really, really hope we eventually see it re-released on the Switch, presented like it is in your video here. It's in my plans to play the game this year, and I just keep hoping we'll see it pop up in an N64 online starter pack around Christmas time along with a SNES pack and hopefully a classic/color GameBoy pack. :D

"I knew OF Mischief Makers; I remember getting pretty interested in it as a kid, after reading some Nintendo Power coverage of it, as I recall. But I never got the chance to actually play it. None of the stores had it. Crazy Mike's, the local video rental place, didn't have it (though weirdly they DID have Tonic Trouble, which I WANTED to like but didn't, really). Online shopping was still kind of in its infancy. I guess maybe I could have ordered it from Funcoland (god, this comment is taking me on a trip. They probably had a website too even back then, but I mostly remember the catalogs we got in the mail), but I was 7 and had neither money nor patience, so on the occasions I talked my parents into buying me games I generally wanted to go straight to the store and carry whatever I found home that night, not wait for a mail-order. We lived 45 minutes away from the nearest store that stocked video games, and even THAT drive seemed like it took forever when I was excited about the release of Pokemon or what have you.

"Tonic Trouble and Mischief Makers are featured in the same video? Nice! I actually have some sort of history with those games, but not in the way you think.

My cousin Roshan once had an N64 when I was a young autistic child and one of the games aside from Diddy Kong Racing, Pokémon Stadium and Mario 64, was Mischief Makers... but I never got to see him play it, nor did I. Not even when I went to Mississauga to with my sisters. All I ever saw was the cartridge with Marina on it.

Tonic Trouble on the other hand was relatively unknown to me, but I did actually own a bendy plush of the main protagonist, Ed... and even then I didn't know who he was. Mom and I just thought he was a funny looking guy and called him BD&E because that's what the tag on him said. I wish I still had that plush... with the neck not broken...

Eventually, I did get to experience these two games via the Project 64 Emulator along with Chameleon Twist and in the case of Tonic Trouble, I finally figured out that the plush of Ed I had was from that game.

Though there was a Playstation game I remember my brother playing that starred a sword wielding fox that I promptly forgot about for over a decade... until this year when I saw the thumbnail for the latest Nitro Rad video that I remembered the name: Kingsley's Adventure.",0,0,2018-09-19T21:16:45.000Z,Tommy Deonauth's Archives,UCM6l7lOjkx0YH3fhIgCXoFA,mfX_RDgAx08,True,UgxCSASrsXm8qSwf0UZ4AaABAg
"""If you're a fan of the N64, and you're a fan of Platformers, you have 3 more games to check out here"" Actually good sir that is incorrect on 2 fronts in my use case. 1) I'm actually not a fan of the N64 though it does have many great games I overall feel it's one of Nintendo's weakest consoles, and 2) I have played all 3 of them and still own the first 2. So... yeah. I'm not really sure what my point is. Just that... yeah.

I'm in the mood for an early 3D Platformer though now because of this. Maybe Space Station Silicon Valley?

"Im not going to lie, i do like Tonic Trouble *BUT* only in PC because believe it or not its way better there than in N64, i believe the team didnt had much time to polish the port for the N64 and some stuff got grabbled in transition like the controls and most of the enviroments, in the PC textures are much Hi Res than in the N64 due to that the console while it has a marvelous engine that can do wonders for 3D games (the most defining feature is no texture wraping something that unfortunately the PSX had and while it wasnt something bad it was kinda cool to see a 3D game that didnt had this annoying glitch) its texture resolution is quite low in comparison to the PSX and even Dreamcast or Sega Saturn (yeah i know that the Saturn does have an inferior texture resolution but its quite sharp and more brighter for the most part than N64)

For example Rayman 2 for the N64 doesnt have voice acting, the textures are quite blurry and low res, and most of the time things look a tad bit more darker than the PSX/PC/Dreamcast port of Rayman 2, not to mention that the best version of that game is the PC/Dreamcast since it does have in PC even better graphics, the option to map controls, voice acting, and the textures are more Hi Res than the other ports, but the dreamcast its an almost conversion of the PC version but it has a much lower texture resolution and effects but just for a tad bit.

Tonic Trouble suffered even a worse fate when it was ported to the N64 than Rayman 2, Rayman 2 actually looks and plays almost exactly as the other ports and most of the time people say that its the best way to play Rayman 2 if you dont have the others, but with Tonic Trouble the only way to play it decently is in PC because that game plays and looks way better there, but that's just my silly thoughts really.",0,0,2018-09-19T09:47:03.000Z,GBlastMan,UCpPECZcPiHE3DCcCVtQDS2Q,mfX_RDgAx08,True,Ugw0NhwX91MaAVEtWHB4AaABAg

Yoshi's island has tons of random stuff and it's great, so why is that a bad thing in this case? The mechanics and secrets weren't that hard to figure out.

IRC, AIM, custom DOOM wads, Japanese ROMs translated by modern day monks... even torrents are coming under attack. It's over. The wild west of the internet is done.

All this in tandem with silicon valley and social media sites infringing on the first amendment... genX and millennials are truly the last great generation. Welcome to 1984.

It got hugged to half-death from the recent influx of new users. They posted this

The server is currently being extremely slow due to a traffic spike from the EmuParadise shutdown. Our bandwidth is capable of handling the traffic (with around 2Gbps used of 10Gbps), however our disk IO is maxed out, leading to severe slowdowns.

They're working on a solution but it'll probably take a few days/weeks until the spike dies down. Bookmark the site and revisit once the panic quiets down. Too many folks are panic spamming downloads, it's bottlenecking them

It's just the spike in traffic from emuparadise shutting down. A few days/weeks and it'll be back to normal, they're currently working on a fix, and the spike in traffic will die down in time

This comment is a bit old, now, but I'm answering anyway.

Vimm's Lair has never done me wrong. In fact, I don't think they even have ads, let alone viruses, and they have a collection of manual scans as well! NicoBlog and its sister-site CDRomance seem to have a lot of stuff I can't find anywhere else, as well, so they make a good backup when something you want isn't on Vimm (though they use third-party file sharing services like Google Drive and Mega for most of their stuff, rather than hosting their own files). Apparently NicoBlog even offers full ROM sets rather than having to download things individually, if you want. And as a last resort, I use Rom Hustler (though if you're going to use that site, I recommend getting an ad-blocker like uBlock Origin or Adblock Plus; the site occasionally gets those malicious ads that try to disguise themselves as a download button, so it's best to put the kibosh on that before you end up clicking on something bad).

EDIT: Also see the thread here for more good places. Apparently Vimm is being hit by the internet traffic pretty hard right now, so it might be best to avoid them for a while so we don't make their servers crash... ;)

Heh, thanks. I've found a few more good options since posting that comment: The Eye has games from many obscure systems as well as the more well-known ones, The ROM Depot offers both individual games and full sets for many different systems (as well as quite a few scans of different game manuals), and emuparadise's file servers aren't actually offline yet -- the games can still be downloaded by using the greasemonkey script offered here. ;)

"Well, while I can't say I agree with you on a lot of things, considering I really like this game, I can say that I do feel you are right in that it is a frustrating experience when one realizes exactly what was going on behind the scenes at Square Enix concerning the development of Final Fantasy Versus XIII and the overall mismanagement of the Crystal Tools engine pretty much delaying not only that game, but KH3 as well because Nomura and the team behind KH1 and 2 were working on it and it was a mess. And then the reason we got Dream Drop Distance is simply because Nintendo asked them for a KH game for their new 3DS, even though it's pretty clear that Nomura just wanted to finish off his damn FF game and then get to KH3.

I mean, I assume he just wanted to do Versus XIII more than some 3DS game, but I'm not privy to that kind of thing. That's just my speculation. I'm just going in a roundabout way to say if it feels like a mess... I think it's just because Nomura wasn't that into this game.

Crash Bandicoot - Crash Bandicoot
Crash Bandicoot is a video game franchise of platform video games. The series, originally exclusive to the Sony PlayStation, was created by Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin during their tenure at Naughty Dog for Sony Computer Entertainment.
If Smash Bros Ultimate is supposed to be a celebration of gaming history, Crash is just as necessary as Sonic, if not more! 

That would be so awesome seeing Crash next to Mario, Sonic, Pac-Man, Megaman, Snake, Cloud and Bayonetta - Aidanisawesome 

Crash is an icon and needs to be next to his 90s rivals Mario & Sonic

Come on, Sakurai wanted him in smash, but he ended up as a mii costume, it's time for him to step up! 

Geno is just that one Mario Character I think we need. 

People always wanted the Mario rpg series to have a rep, I believe Geno would be the best pick. A way to show that Nintendo and Square Enix are as buddy buddy as we think they are.new

Bandana Dee - Kirby
Well he is part of the main four Kirby characters and is pretty much Kirby's best friend. He has appeared in every mainline kirby game for seven going on eight years now and is on par with the rest of the squad in skill. Also he so so precious. He is so perfect. He deserves to be in. Everyone says he is just a generic waddle dee, but that is the whol point of his character. To show that through perserverance hard work and determination, you are truly unique and prover yourself different from the crowd. Literally the only thing in common he has with other waddle dees is appearance. 

They're already adding from franchises in the game and he has so much at his disposal, be a little odd having similar sized characters (him and kirby) but he could act very differently 

We could have the whole Return to Dream Land team.+1

Shadow - Sonic
Shadow the Hedgehog is a character who appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog series released by Sega. He is an artificially created black and red hedgehog whose hover shoes propel him at extreme speeds that rival those of Sonic.
I say that I wanna see Shadow in action against Sonic. Mostly because he's been in the Super Smash Bros series (Brawl - Smash Bros 4) as Assistant Trophy. And since Dark Samus joins the fight as Echo Character, we can add him as Echo fighter as well. I hope he can be there as Echo Fighter 

He has a high chance of being in the game. He isn't confirmed as an assist trophy yet so the bio-mechanical hedgehog has a solid chance of making it in.
He would be an echo fighter of Sonic but slightly slower but much stronger, and some different moves and animations 

I think he could be added to the game as an echo fighter of Sonic, and we didn't have seen him as an assist trophy yet, and with Knuckles being one, this could be a chance for Shadow to finally be a playable character. 

It's a need.new

Reasons why They could be added to smash, because:
1.-This would be a good step to microsoft and nintendo relationship.
2.-Phil Spencer says that he wanted for smash
3.-It would be easy to make a moveset
4.- People missed the days when Nintendo and Rare where allies
5.- They been leave for a while, this could be a good opportunitie to revive the franchise

Only people who actually grew up with Melee will really understand why it's so loved. Can't expect a 13 or 15 year old to have fond memories of the game. I got Melee Christmas of 2003 and for a while that was the only game of its kind. It was fun and you never ran out of things to do mainly because of those oh so difficult unlockable events. Then Brawl came along and it was different in terms of stages and game play. Sure Brawl had more characters but the introduction of the smash ball and how characters were harder to blast off made the game just unlikeable to people like me who only knew Melee at the time. I'm not one of those people who judge based of nostalgia but Brawl is not that good as people defend it to be and I don't know why people can't accept that.,0,0,2018-09-08T17:27:12.000Z,Keewee Froot,UCUNt480LD_rU9dYLrUz2ReA,xjWTowXRhWM,True,UgycBVcoVqxWT886LVh4AaABAg

"Spyro trilogy is that kind of game where first game is like ""testing ground"". I mean. It's small, all levels are simple and doesn't have many things but it makes it popular anyway. Second one is the true essence of Spyro, cause it adds what first game lacked. Developers are more experienced etc. Variety is the key there.

Spyro 3 was awesome too. But I can't really deicde what game I like the most. For sure it's 2 or 3. And it's epic that they did Year of the Dragon REALLY in year of the dragon :D

There is many things Spyro 3 improved. But also many things that S2 did better. That's why both games are awesome to me. I really can't chose one best Spyro game. Cause them both deserve attention.

Haha, I miss double jump in Spyro 3 xD

The reason why I love Spyro 3 is because it's very very like Spyro 2. I don't like when franchise that I love changes. Because the reason why I love it was because how it was like. So i it changes... my feelings change too. It doesn't appear in every game, though. It really depends. For example I love Tomb Raiders, no matter how they changed... however it's the story and character charisma what counts there, right? We have tombs? We do. We kill the bad guys? We do. So it's okay. But Spyro doesn't have storyline that big to actually make a good game no matter of how it looks. That's why I... I like A Hero's Tail, but not that much. It's not that good game. But I think You know what I mean. We need the same vibe in a game to feel the same awesomeness.

Removing soul was good. I mean... it was unnecessary thing that You had to get to activate things. Also... it's cool though, because Forgotten Realms have their own magic stored, right? So they were more powerful than soul collecting. Also it was pretty stupid. Why You have to kill to activate the power ups in a first place? Gameplay-wise it was cool, but unnecessary. But logic-wise... ummm... pretty stupid.

It's sad that the cutcenes didn't return. But I didn't really care. It was fine anyway.

Oh, right. That destroying the sculpture sound had so high volume xD

Backtracking was very nice in Spyro games. I mean... it was so secretly secret when You found the ladder in Sunny Beach and couldn't go up. You was just wondering what will be there. And when will You learn how to get there.",0,0,2018-09-07T10:14:28.000Z,FeatheredGryphon,UCawlixzyKIuLD5KqWLrLsGA,VoVAT2l-6TM,True,Ugyv3H_avIQenaAUU_d4AaABAg

A level I remember dying a lot on was ""Koindozer Klamber"" of DKC3. For those who don't know, It's a jungle level located in ""KAOS Kore."" Majority of the enemies are ""Koindozers."" ""Koin"" is the Kremling using each level's DK Coin as a shield. ""Koindozer"" is his pink counterpart, and he can actually run, unlike Koin. Koindozers use their trash can lids/shields to knock you into pits. It may sound easy, but you actually need some well-timed jumps just to keep your balloons from popping.

"Just downloaded this video and plan to watch it on my phone. I don't have an Internet connection, or a television at home for that matter, so downloading while at the library is a must for when I get home late at night and want something to watch. 

I enjoy your video's very much, AntDude. Thank you for the quality content you provide. Keep it up friend. God bless you.

Oh, and no worries. I'll play the video's I download while on YouTube so that you can get your moola.

"I seem to be in agreement with the vast majority of Spyro fans. While I do enjoy all the games immensely, Year of the Dragon takes the cake because of the variety in collectibles, level designs, etc. Though Ripto's Rage is definitely a great game as well. But if I had to rank 'em, I'd go Year of the Dragon, Ripto's Rage, and Spyro The Dragon. 

Great video by the way. I enjoy your view and opinions on games, but what I truly appreciate is that you do not cuss. Well... you do take the Lord's name in vain which does sadden me, but I can't tell you what you can and cannot say. But with that aside, you're one of the few YouTuber's who doesn't use vulgarity, and I appreciate that very much.

"Damn, those side characters just ruined the third game for me. Spyro is a really fast character because of his charge and you're getting used to his speed and the gameplay pace very quickly in the two previous games. So when you have to switch constantly, like, half of the third game to the twice or maybe even three times slower characters who can't go any faster than casual promenade it's just getting old pretty fast and starts to be very annoying. Penguin and yeti are the worst, hated them more than anything in this game. And kangaroo is not much better, but damn, that's a kangaroo, it's supposed to run fast! Plus the music. It is always the same on their levels, so you starting to hate it as well, because it's playing over and over and over on the every side character mission! Just a single track for each character!

after experiencing kh 2 again in it's combat design and overall structure on critical lvl 1 and many other dificulties it is not my favorite for many reasons reaction commands are gimmicy way to much each battle ends with one and each enemy has one. revenge values are highly exploitable espescially with berserk builds. reflect and counterguard is very very broken and well i hate exploration and secrets being gone and there are plenty of minigame filler in some missions that reward literally nothing and are not enjoyable. plus you can clearly see in it's reworked story structure they are adding things just to make more games and the way it is presented is blatent and fast and not really gradual making it by many really confusing. the gummi ship rework though they did really well and forms were nice and stuff moves faster plus synthesis is more fleshed out but it doesn't help really when there is really broken things in place that to make combat fun you somewhat have to not use. 2 is very conflicting with me cause the more times i play it the more i hate it so hopefully i don't play it that many more times so it stays somewhat good in my mind.,0,0,2018-09-02T17:57:22.000Z,kh2ruler,UC8aQDfdXRCuNyTjOES6VrZw,c6l4kvbtVwQ,True,UgxL85sPpBazoq3iX2l4AaABAg

"I disagree entirely with pretty much every complaint you have, and I don't even like the game particularly.  Nitpicking story elements is silly, and I never experienced any of the glitches you mentioned.  I'm assuming since you showed a GameCube copy in the video, that maybe due to the smaller disc, it wasn't optimized properly.  I have the PS2 version, so if that is the case, not an issue for me.  Only complaints I ever had about the game were how annoying the dragonflies were to catch at times and the AWFUL load times, but other than that, I thought it fit the mold of a Spyro game, on the same level as Size Matters fits the mold of a Ratchet and Clank game, smaller, slightly lower quality, but still playable.  I'd honestly make the argument that it's better than the first game, what with the same boss fight over and over (flame, chase through obstacles, flame, chase, flame, chase, etc...only different one was Metalhead, and that barely counts), horrible jumps, and lack of hovering (instead, Triangle makes you DROP.  playing Spyro 2 and 3 and then going back to 1 was a CHORE)  Now I will say this, Spyro 2 and 3 are still much better, but I still, even after watching the whole review, can't figure out the hate, and I probably never will, unless someone can tell me a good reason that isn't story related or related to possibly poor optimization on one console.",0,0,2018-09-02T15:38:48.000Z,Comickid15,UCFtVV0eNXtKKffRK9aV8GFQ,fCXtjr0SrX0,True,UgzygLanmUMe66KwHnR4AaABAg

Id have crash , make the same spins , slides and platforming while adding some really dark forests as well as some really trippy art 
In terms of the levels ...
Some of the unused , Concept art in Crash Twin sanity is a perfect example .

"Spyro 1 is my favorite mainly because it feels the most ""pure"" to me. I thoroughly enjoy the gameplay of the series and the addition of minigames in Spyro 2 just feels like diluting the goodness. Ironically, the ""emptiness"" of the first game actually makes it feel more alive to me; it's its own living, breathing world that I can observe and explore while the plot in the second and third games make it feel more like a script that was written for me to follow. I also much prefer 3 over 2 because it feels more refined. If you're going to have the minigames, I'd prefer them to be in side areas accessed by portals so it doesn't feel like the levels are cut up into the ""real"" Spyro game and some other stuff. Plus I just liked the minigames and most of the level designs much more, and I actually liked all the characters from 3 whereas the only new characters from 2 that I liked were Hunter and Moneybags. I actually didn't like Spyro 2 when I first played it as a kid so I skipped it and came back to it later. I like all three now, but 2 is still easily my least favorite.",0,0,2018-09-01T04:45:50.000Z,Matt Pieti,UCqGsVG-cItmaGzp0bZ3FWOA,VoVAT2l-6TM,True,Ugzi9HbOsl0JOrKPrpZ4AaABAg

"Oh I am thinking about it. Unlike A hero's Tail and Enter the Dragonfly, Sierra realized that attempting the same style of game again would be futile, so they went with something different, and it was a good different. The Legends series is the best part of Spyro if you don't count the original series. I just remember the emotions I had at the end of Eternal Night, it was both epic and sad, and then after the credits they showed what would come next and I just got so many chills. After a long wait, they finally came out with the final game in the series which really made me excited, and good lord was I having a fun time.

"I had no idea that they finished the soundtrack for Year of the Dragon's Greatest Hits version. Both sequels were made about a year apart from their predecessors, so it's not surprising that the devs and composers would have cut corners, but it was disappointing, nonetheless. (Speaking of: didn't Ripto's Rage have a handful or repeat tracks that show up in the last few stages, too?)

I agree that YotD seems to be stretched a bit thin--rushed, even--and the soundtrack is my least favorite of the trilogy. In fact, YotD is my least favorite game in the trilogy, overall. It's true that the original was pretty empty at times and had little reward for collecting everything, but it still feels like a tighter, more inspired experience than YoTD.

I'm glad to see that Toys for Bob are taking some creative license with the remake, too. At this point, I honestly hope that they completely redo certain mini-games and EVERY Agent 9 segment.

"My theory is RAGE sounded too intense for europe here; or something and at the time there were a lot of complaints about games being violent or something.

It's all silly but very likely the word ""rage"" might of been seen as ""Too Agressive"" and swapped in fear of the game being rejected. That's my theory anyway; the name change was probably all because someone was a wimp and buckled under fear of backlash from it, rather than any real reason. ""Gateway to Glimmer"" made it feel (for me as a kid) too much like a fantasy adventure than an action-adventure.

Makes me think I'm a dragon roaming an open world filled with secrets and discoveries, rather than jumping from world to world , fighting bad guys and colelcting things.

"I've never been a fan of characters introduced purely for exposition and guidance. The same thing happened with Croc, and I hated it. Everything Spyro 2 does was done in the original without overcomplicating it, and the lack of friendly faces gave it a more mature vibe overall. You were on your own with no one for moral support. If you wanted reassurance, you had to make progress on saving dragons. Everything was typically straight-forward, and any especially convoluted things you had to do were explained briefly by the dragons.

Insomniac's thing was Disruptor. Their personal interest was grimdark fantasy, inspired by a game about a lonewolf soldier. It's terribly obvious that Spyro followed that closely, while trying to portray itself as a game for children. I bet they were happy with how the original turned out, because it really was the best of both worlds.

"Am I the only one who actually loved Sticker Star? I really genuinely enjoyed this game. Whether it be the open world with tons of exploration to do, or the greatly designed levels which looked and played very well, or even the wide and diverse cast of stickers and things, which gave the game charm. You guys might complain about how stickers must be used for battle, but for one, there FREAKING EVERYWHERE! If you complain about running out of stickers, then you have to be blind. No exceptions. Now even though the battle system was considered horrible, I still found it quite enjoyable to figure which sticker would do this battle in the most efficient manner, it makes you think and use strategy. This game's direction can be vague at times, there's no denying you will probably need to look up a few things, but nothing is more satisfying than finally finding the answer to a puzzle you have been stuck on. There is no leveling up system, however, the HP-UP hearts are there for a reason. Sticker Star was an experiment, and I think it is a great game and I love.

"If I remember correctly the reason for there being no Idols in the last world is due to two reasons.

Reason 1 is that the Idols were used for moral and power to open a portal to the next realm. Making way to where Ripto's castle and lair truely lies. The boss fights being a midway point in the portal to fight the boss.

Reason 2 is the final world Ripto knowing you are coming after him feels prepared and just let's you go straight to the fight.. I think Elora or the Professor that tell you that you should get a certain amount of the power orbs since they wanna use that power to give you an edge against Ripto.

"The collectables do have a purpose. You can't get to the final level without them. Spyro 2 is my first Spyro game and PS1 game. I saw my cousin play it and decided to get the game when I actually won a PS1 in a contest. Talk about lucky. Spyro had low sales in Japan because they fucked up the controls. Why mess with something that isn't broken? They didn't even localize the 3rd game there. The only thing I like about Japanese Spyro is the fact that Spyro sounds like a tomboy. I like how they came up with Ripto. Elora the goat. I'm a faun you dork! Elora's tail looks more fox-like in the original. I'm still having trouble getting used to her redesign. Well if we save the crystalized dragons again we might as well be playing the first game again. 5:13 Her chest is flat and her bra is just floating an inch away from her chest. Trouble with the trolley eh? You shut your damn mouth. I think the alchemist turned Hunter's boots into stone. I think the fetch quest is one of the last orbs I have gotten. Spyro is also voiced by Sponge Bob. 8:39 I forgot about that. It's not like there couldn't be a 4th world. Spyro 1 and 3 had more than 3 worlds. RIP Spring Savanna. That would be a nice name for a world. 9:17 That's a flower? 9:45 It's possible to fly over that wall. I use the cheats to skip Moneybags in Glimmer. In Winter Tundra you can simply reach Ripto without playing the levels there if you have enough orbs which is why talismans are no longer needed. Spyro is a double agent. 13:36 Oh you do know the trick. I didn't know the double jump had this many uses. 14:29 Wait why does Ripto have a sceptor here? Didn't he lose it? Ripto is apparantly lava proof since he did NOT burn to death, unless someone or something revived him. 17:58 He has Spiderman powers. 18:07 That Earthshaper is a pimp. Moneybags swindled the bonebuilders one time too many. 19:34 Wait I don't remember getting this. Spyro missed his chance with Elora.

"Hi, British person here. Spyro 2's subtitle, Ripto's Rage, was changed to Gateway To Glimmer as the former was deemed too aggressive for Europeans. Given how well it sold, there may have been some wisdom there even if it's a pretty BS reason compared to name changes for Ratchet and Clank games. I like Gateway To Glimmer better as Ripto doesn't really unleash any kind of fury actively against Spyro until the final boss fight and Gateway To Glimmer better emphasizes to exploration gameplay and new region to explore: Avalar.",0,0,2018-08-25T09:06:39.000Z,PlebNC,UChCkNv14ZW09WTaLVD_Ezdg,K1cSlI3tcF8,True,UgyPrJzsORXzS5wrYmJ4AaABAg

"Another awesome review. However, I just want to clarify one thing:
The first level is Glimmer, not Avalar.
Avalar is a large world or realm, like the Dragon Realms (Spyro's home).
The Dragon Realms contain all the home worlds from the first game. 
Just like The Dragon Realms, Avalar contains smaller home worlds.
These home worlds are Summer Forest, Autumn Plains and Winter Tundra.
I'm sure it was just an accidental mix up with the names :)",0,0,2018-08-25T07:45:29.000Z,dkakut,UCh3L1pRHoXz0xQqoJWpO4lQ,K1cSlI3tcF8,True,UgwZf9kNGXvQXQTD0fJ4AaABAg

"What few people tend to grasp about games is that gameplay isn't really the ONLY thing about a game. Gameplay is the outstanding point yes because it's a game, but what makes a truly amazing game stand out above the rest involves other things. The music, the character, the story, the design. Jak II is that kind of game that has the story and character...and then that's where it stops. Gameplay sure it's decent enough, it's basically poor man's GTA where you go to mission waypoints and do the objectives, the major differences from GTA being stuff like the hoverboard and dark Jak. So gameplay is decent

Though when it comes to Jak and Daxter, as dated and simple as it may be, it had it all. Great straightforward gameplay, great characters, a simple but effective story, beautiful music, and wonderful scenery. Haven City is the most boring city I've ever seen, and nothing about it is memorable, meanwhile I can remember every location from Jak 1, and I actually had and played Jak II for a larger chunk of my childhood than I did Jak 1.

"The only bits of spyro I've ever played in my life were the water stage with the baby turtles and lava stage with the cave men of spyro 2 on a demo.

At first i only liked the lava stage and despised the water stage but after a while i craved more and eventually grew to like the water stage. 

But the reason i never just bought the actual game is the same reason i only played the first stage of crash 1 on a demo as a kid.

Because jak & daxter and ratchet & clank filled the void.

As of today I've beaten all 3 og crash games, played plenty of ctr, crash bash, wrath of cortex, twinsanity and tag team racing.

But for spyro i only played a little bit of one of the legends games. I know it was either the 1st or 2nd but forgot which.

Anyway maybe i can give spyro the chance i only gave crash, jak and ratchet. Those haven't let me down and the little I've played of spyro gives me the same feelings i had towards those so I'm sure I'll enjoy them.",0,0,2018-08-24T22:45:17.000Z,Homeslice Heroes,UCXics2oWXgdzvcspuTf0orA,K1cSlI3tcF8,True,UgxfAbaTwDcdwIU0sbN4AaABAg

"Here are my Smash Ultimate Character Predictions I will be predicting 13 more characters Echo Fighters: Ken- Ryu: Ken was the OG echo fighter so it would make sense to make him an echo fighter not to mention vergenben the guy who leaked simon,ice climbers and Ridley said in response to someone asking why a leak was removed said “because it was trash it didint have ken in” Isabelle-Villager: Isabelle has become very popular even becoming Mario kart 8 dlc and even becoming the face of the animal crossing social media page not to mention vergenben also said she was gonna be in the game not to mention that ever since brawl there’s been a new ac assist trophy to represent the franchise brawl had resetti 4 had Isabelle and smash ultimate has Kappn which is most likely her replacement Shadow-sonic - shadow is a very popular sonic character and has a high chance due to the fact that shadow is a way to get a new sonic rep without Gothitelle-Gardevoir now you may be asking “what the heck gardevoirs not in the game” well a leak that said richter,dark samus and King K. Rool were gonna be in the game also said that gardevoir and gothtitelle was gonna be in the game he also said that gothitelle was gonna be an echo of gardevoir which makes because they both have similar body types and are psychic types not to mention it’s an easy way of gettting both a gen 3 pokemon and gen 5 pokemon in New Fighters: Skull Kid:skull kids assist trophy role seems to be replaced with the moon not to mention with the heroes vs villains theme smash ultimates been going super for it would make sense to include skull kid he was also a mii costume in smash 4 which shows Nintendo knows how popular he is also smash ultimate has had a lot of majoras mask representation with the moon and young link coming back Gardevoir why I think that: gardevoir is a popular Pokémon and has been in pokken tournament so she’s used to throwing fists around also same thing about the leak earlier also we need some gen 3 representation Arle Why I think that: arle is a highly requested smash character in Japan even making it into the 19 most requested and if were gonna get a new sonic rep might as well put in a new Sega franchise as well not to mention she has a game on the switch has been around for a long time and could be a good representative for the puzzle genre Bandana Dee: he is a very requested character and most of the new characters that have been revealed for smash ultimate have been highly requested character it wouldn’t be hard to come up with a move set for him and has the highest chance out of any Kirby character for smash Isaac: once again he is a highly requested character and sakurai may have teased him by posting that picture Incineroar: I know it’s weird to have 3 new pokemon reps but just roll with me vergenben the guy I previously mentioned said that there was gonna be a gen 7 rep and it wouldn’t be decidueye,mimikyu or lycancroc I was betting on marshadow but he became a pokeball and then I thought about zerora but characters like him are too new and then vergenben he believed it to be incineroar so yeah I’m on his side Banjo Kazoiee: He is highly requested and Microsoft and Nintendo have been on good terms as of recently and hell even the president of Microsoft said he wanted him in  Geno: a highly requested character clouds in smash so if Square Enix ok with cloud in smash then I’m sure they’re okay with geno in he also was the only mii costume to a reveal trailer Paper Mario: he is a highly requested character and in the leak that I mentioned that had richter in also had a character named “Mario 2” which is most likely paper Mario",0,0,2018-08-21T23:49:57.000Z,Cesar Vera,UCrr3UFt0e9Kg4EGWQKSrdvg,n_9mUGlC54M,True,UgwzyWcKZC2arKaD2y94AaABAg

"I understand the debate whether to consider Kirby Battle Royale a main series game or a spin-off game. It fits the main series because Kirby fights with his copy abilities, which players don't see with the Kirby spin-off games. And as common with many Kirby games, the penultimate boss is Meta Knight and the final boss is King Dedede. At the same time, it doesn't fit the Kirby main series. Kirby does not platform a stage. While he utilitizes copy abilities, he does not gain them from sucking up his enemies. Speaking of enemies, the common opponent is clones of Kirby. No other bosses exist aside from clone Kirbys, Meta Knight and King Dedede. The evidence of spin-off seems to outweigh the main series. If indeed a spin-off, Battle Royale does not need to explain Kirby's absence of copy abilities because Kirby does use copy abilities. Overall. Kirby Battle Royale feels like a cross between Mario Party and Super Smash Bros. Only 1 minigame is pure fighting. Other minigames do not require it, but fighting gives an advantage. The more I think about it, this game is an even more casual alternative to Super Smash Bros. for the casual gamer. As for my grand conclusion on the debate between main series vs. spin-off, it's either the worst of the main series or the best of spin-off series. I would len towards the latter more than the former.",1,0,2018-08-21T18:48:16.000Z,accquizzer,UCMwZDEG9iJxUjPMjMupD9Ew,5MqV23npKQ8,True,Ugywf1NHakQ2zALOast4AaABAg

"I'm trying to cut Kirby's Blowout Blast a break for its short gameplay time. I know it was originally a bonus minigame on Planet Robobot, and Nintendo just expanded on it to make it a standalone downloadable game. Still, Nintendo could have done so much more with it. This was the first Kirby 3D Kirby game (or at least the closest to true 3D to date). This could have been the next biggest Kirby title with that 3D aspect, but Nintendo really didn't do anything with it. Kirby can still suck up his enemies, but Kirby cannot copy abilities. HAL Laboratories made sure none of the enemies in the game had abilities Kirby could copy, so kudos to them for that. At the same time, it feels like a step back. I wonder if HAL Laboratories took this step back to appeal to nostalgia when experimenting with new gameplay. I hope HAL Laboratories experiments more with 3D gameplay. I would love to play a truly 3D Kirby game from the main series.",0,0,2018-08-21T18:37:45.000Z,accquizzer,UCMwZDEG9iJxUjPMjMupD9Ew,ywVeMxjSgjM,True,UgyCznnaDp52K6PirKN4AaABAg

"My God man do you not understand the combat at all!? Yes, there is too much emphasize on the attack option as there is not enough reason to use magic throughout the early stages of the game (trust me once you have gravity and stop you will use magic more) but you are doing a lot more than just mashing x in each fight. You have limit attacks to use, summons that assist you, abilities that change the way the combat plays, and a sense of timing that is needed to know when to strike an enemy, when to evade an attack, or when to block an attack to lead to a counter. You haven't learned about the game's depth of combat at all. What you're doing here is the same as saying that shooters just make you mash R1 all the time. Obviously that isn't the case with shooters as you need to have good aim and so saying that all you need to do in Kingdom Hearts is just ""mash the x button"" is completely uninformed and, if anything, just shows that you play on Beginner mode instead of Proud mode. Like I said the game rewards you for timing your attacks, evading an enemies attack, and guarding certain moves. They even have an entire tech point system that rewards this type of play. There are even certain enemies like the Large Body Heartless that force you to think differently on how you approach them. Large Bodies can only be attack physically from the back but can be attacked anywhere with magic. You simply didn't play on Proud mode and thus were not forced to deal with stronger, more aggressive enemies that force you to be strategic as well as force you to have good reflexes and timing. You seriously don't do any justice to the Kingdom Hearts series with these videos.

Edit: I just want to say that I don't hate your videos or you personally and I might have seemed harsh in the comment but I am just passionate about the series and I believe that you aren't giving the credit the combat system for the original deserves. It definitely has flaws that get greatly improved in the future but some of the flaws you mentioned aren't true flaws or simply get removed in the higher difficulties.",0,0,2018-08-15T23:33:35.000Z,Gyro 10499,UCw37bgb4LOem_SW9buFrDsQ,ZOFql5pRth4,True,UgyTSy7Sado3M2rylEh4AaABAg

"Love the video, great critiques almost all around, though I have to point out a small... hiccup in one of them.

You acted as if the collectables were just there for the sake of being there, but they aren't for a very important reason that many people that already go through and collect everything REGARDLESS will potentially miss. As a kid, I ran into this a lot: they're how you unlock the other worlds. You need to free a certain amount of dragons, collect a certain amount of gems or catch all of the thieves to progress through the game, so there IS a point to it all.

Plus, it also leads to unlocking Gnasty's Loot if you've collected everything in the game up until that point. You don't automatically get it for ""beating the game"", but you praised it for being a great unlockable reward at the end when it's only accessible to completionist runs that've 100%'d the game.

"I started my Playstation journey with Spyro 2 but I did play the rest of the trilogy later. I actually did play Crash recently and could not get into it. It aged poorly, lacks analog support, and has one of the worst save systems I've ever seen that I had to cheat and use the passwords to get to where I want to be. The second Crash improved the save system greatly but I didn't feel like playing the game anymore. Spyro looks better, aged better, and is just a much better game than Crash is. Never heard of Disruptor before. Well since we don't see TVs in the Dragon World, Gnasty Gnorc is probably using magic to watch this. There's a bad guy, he did a bad thing. You are the good chosen guy. Do the thing. Spyro it's great to see you, but I got to go. What? Only 15 say ""Thank you""? That's not too much. 8:37 I found that too. I think the programmers forgot to make this thing damage you. 12:20 I can't believe I got killed by a sheep. Actually I think the dogs killed me in Toasty rather than the boss itself.

"Great video for a great game !
I agree with most of your video, except for certain points.

First, the gameplay/controls : it's really good, and the only minus to me is the lack of the hover move that was introduced in the sequel. Overall, it's great

~
However. I really don't like either the camera or the controls in the flying section. It makes you feel as if every fail at them wasn't yours (Spyro 3 fixes this tho to me)
~

Then, the level design : Oh my god I love it ! It's that same ""small toy box"" mentality that also are in Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64. I just love that level design in 3D platformer collectathons. As for the game not giving you many insentives to collect stuff, to me, it reinforces the toy box aspect of the level design, with the joy to freely collect stuff without being gridded. A good collectathon joy to me ! So, it's outstanding

Then, there's the presentation. It didn't aged well to me. But that's what makes it good to me. I cannot explain it tho. And the music is good. Not memorable but still good.

And the bosses aren't really good to me. That's one thing the sequels execute better.

So overall, it's a great game, with only the lack of a move, the flying sections and the bosses as critiscism. At least it doesn't have the overabundance of ""mini-games"" from Spyro 2 or the other playable characters from Spyro 3.",0,0,2018-08-15T02:47:21.000Z,Vilmy21,UChDNxix0pGVjfqWioXYDqmQ,mS8Xu2ZJpL4,True,UgzT3S3uqWU8cblx3ER4AaABAg

"What makes Meele better than brawl is getting your nintendo gamecube for christmas and being blown away by how much better the graphics were compared to the N64, and also the roster was doubled compared to the n64 one. Also we didnt have much internet back then so when you suddenly challenge a new fighter you really had no idea who it was going to be. Everyone got new attacks and new mechanics like smash attacks, plus there were so many levels and new game modes. 

Brawl was amazing as well but a lot of it was spoiled by trailers and reveals. Imagine going in to the game not knowing Sonic the hedgehog or Snake was a hidden character. Maybe I would have liked Brawl more if it was all a surprise like meele. Also Brawl had seriously floaty mechanics and felt so slow to the point that people could predict your moves. The gameplay is the most important part of smash. Its why I barely played the Wii U one. Just not that fun in my opinion.",0,0,2018-08-14T02:07:30.000Z,Stuff3,UCmINlsPeWS7KpxS7Hz7uTWQ,xjWTowXRhWM,True,Ugwrw6hu4PjxpkZECBB4AaABAg
