"To answer the question over film budgets, the marketing is not included in the budget you find on IMDb or other websites. Marketing is usually double that number. So Terminator Salvation lost millions of dollars potentially and which probably led to waiting for Arnold to return. But Terminator Genysis sucked and didn't do well in the US but did well overseas. This is also why really low budget horror films like Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch Project were considered massive successes because they were extremely cheap to make and had a small marketing campaign but made millions as a result as profit as a result. WB somewhat considered BvS to be a failure because 500 mil was spent on it and nearly another 500 in marketing but didn't make 1 billion in global box office resulting in a form of loss.",0,0,2017-04-17T22:44:56.000Z

"general rule of thumb with movies is whatever the production budget was, you can double that amount and that's what the advertising costs amounted to. So Danny says 200 million for production, which basically means they spent AT LEAST 400 million dollars on the entire film. Like all investments, it's not a matter of whether you make your money back but HOW MUCH you make, and Terminator: Salvation didn't even make back the total cost for making and advertising the film.
Power Rangers is a worse example. They spent somewhere around 250 million USD total for that film and as of now, it hasn't even broken 100 million box office.

Movies are reeeeeaaal tricky, if it's not balls out amazing, then you can't guarantee to investors it'll satisfy, which is why Disney puts on a big song and dance with Star Wars Celebration and everything else, it has to seem huge, like the biggest thing ever, or they can't know if it'll bank.",0,0,2017-04-17T21:42:30.000Z

"I love how specter knight's health bar is called ""will"". Because he is undead,  it wouldn't make sense to have health, and since his character is driven to return to his pervious form, when he gets hit he doesn't lose health, he loses will power. Just one of the many little touches the people at Yacht club games puts in to make Shovel Knight so awesome.",519,4,2017-04-17T20:38:37.000Z

"a movie has to make 2-3 times (rather 3 times) the production budget at the box office as a rule of thumb to call it a success. marketing costs don't count in the production cost numbers, but more importantly an investor only invests to gain a certain margin, even if he get's only his money back it is basically a failure, since the investor could have doubled his money in another better investment. the risk was taken, no profit gained, so a waste of money and time occured. so it has consequences in later projects, since investors see that past projects could get barely their money back.

"you might feel better if the bad guy wins if you learn about the backstory of the antagonist, because sometimes they went bad because something sad happened to them, or they aren't even bad at all, just confused. in the situation with specter in this video, i feel that i'm rooting for him in this game-mode because he isn't a bad guy, the only reason he works for the enchantress is because he wants his human body back.  the main game-mode it has  deep storyline and you're still rooting for shovel knight and thinking that the bad guys are just complete evil. but then you play these bonus game-modes, it shines a new light on the enemies, showing that they aren't that bad, just misunderstood. in plenty of video games there are characters who are thought to be a bad guy, but aren't. I could go on and on about examples of these, but that would be a waste of time to explain in the first place. And it would be a waste of your time having to read that. then again, this time i spent making this comment was probably a waste of time, i just felt like putting in my own 2 cents on this topic. this may not have a direct relation to the gameplay itself, but it's related to the storyline of the game itself.

And just as an afterthought, i like the idea they are adding new content to play as the bad guys, that could help shine some light on their backstories and show they aren't that evil. it just seems nice to know about the stories of the other characters in the story. Because when you play a video game like this, you get intrigued by the storyline, and want to learn more about it. in my opinion adding these parts adds a lot to the story of this game. and at the end of the main game (i watched them finish it) it could lead well into another sequel to the game, involving a lot more items and stuff. but that's just my opinion.

when people write things like this, i notice they most of the time tell people to like if they agree, but i am not going to ask that, because when people do that, they are just asking for likes, instead of actually making something people would want to like on their own. if you are one of the people who decided to waste enough time to read all of this, i applaud you.",28,8,2017-04-17T18:39:38.000Z

"A movie needs to make about double what it cost to make to ""break even"" by Hollywood standards, as about half of the money the movie makes goes to the theaters showing it (it's not exact, but it's a rough estimate). Budget does not account for marketing costs, which are not usually broadcast by the studio. So, by Hollywood standards, Terminator Salvation actually lost the studio quite a bit of money, which is why they attempted a soft reboot with Terminator Genesys, which did even worse.",1,0,2017-04-17T18:28:22.000Z

"Favorite Dragon Ball characters are Freeza, King Piccolo, and Zamasu, all of which are villains. Almost every story I've ever come across I much preferred the villain, I feel like they're always inherently more interesting, because a lot of the time heroes are significantly less flawed than villains, like Arin says. It's easier to relate to a more flawed, complex character. I don't think that's the only reason though, because although I don't relate to certain characters at all, I love watching them. I think that, for me, negative emotions like anger at a character in a story for doing something evil or sadness that they killed a very kind character is much more effective and lasting to me than the normal hero characters. 

I know a lot of people probably don't care about this because I mean who the fuck am I, but I'm just interested to see what everyone else thinks and how everyone else feels about their favorite villains, why they enjoy them and all.",0,0,2017-04-17T17:59:05.000Z

"DONT BE SWAYED MY CHILDREN.

So just to play devil's advocate, I've dated a method actress and her and ALL her actor friends all agree that Bale was totally in the wrong with his behaviour. 

So while Arin and Dan might now advocate his actions, just know that their experiences with people in the industry are hardly reflective of all people in the industry and don't really justify or condemn the guys actions.

"10:35 Because I'm the kind of total nerd who actually follows box office stuff, $371 million off a $200 million budget is... not the best. Not outright awful, but not enough to be a legit success. These days a film typically needs to make somewhere between 2 to 3 times its production budget (usually 2.5 times) to start turning a profit, partly due to marketing costs but particularly because roughly half of the ticket sales goes to the theatres instead of directly to the studios (the percentage varies depending on the country). So in Terminator Salvation's case it would have needed around $500 million to be an outright success. But it also didn't do poorly enough to stop anyone from making Terminator: Genisys years later...
